airline_name,date,content,overall_ratingalaska-airlines,26/07/15,"Checked into Alaska Airlines at the Santa Rosa airport 2 hours before take off. The plane was 30 minutes late. Because they were late they decided to rush boarding and instead of the allotted 30 minutes it was more like 10-15 minutes. My 70 year mom and dad were right behind us in security. My husband and I got through security and we were rushed to get on the plane. I told them there were 2 more behind us. They decided to just cut the line there and didn't let them board! To top it off I was worried about my 70 year old mom (she was upset and crying) so I asked the flight attendant about my mom and dad not being on the plane. She snapped at me that it was too bad, and that they probably weren't there on time. I responded that we checked into the airport 2 hours previously. She said rudely, 'so?'. My mom ended up having to fly out of her way north to Seattle and them back down to San Diego to make it in time. Horrible airline, insensitive staff, rude, and couldn't care less about their customers and how they treat then. ",1alaska-airlines,23/07/15,"Short one and half hour flight, seats were comfortable, very friendly staff from check in until we disembarked and we were given a free snack and drinks.",8alaska-airlines,15/07/15,"Flew down to Louisville from Anchorage with a stop at ORD on the way. Bumped up to First again which was nice. Crew was great, plane clean and on time. I found nothing to complain about and arrived relaxed and pleased with the service. O'Hare airport in Chicago was a zoo. It was as crowded and noisy as Atlanta always seems to be. I went to the American Admirals Club and mellowed out for a few hours - fine service there and the views of the aircraft was a plus. Flight to SDF on American Eagle was fine - the E-175 they use was quite a nice aircraft for this short trip, great views from the large windows on board. The return trip back to ANC began again at SDF to ORD, same plane as above, fine service, nice crew etc. I was routed to Portland from Chicago this time. All went well, I was seated in economy and had no complaints. I purchased the movie viewer and was well entertained. Great service too. The flight to ANC was near perfect. Only problem encountered was that our luggage was about thirty five minutes late getting to us. I put in and received my 2500 free air miles for that issue. All in all, flights were fine, crews were great and on time for all sectors. I feel Alaska should move up to a 4 Star rating.",9alaska-airlines,12/07/15,"One way, PDX-LAX. Everything was smooth sailing. Seats were comfortable, staff were great, and the flight was on time. I also like the electrical outlets in the seats. The big disappointment was the food. Nothing substantial on this flight except cookies and a small bag of pretzels. They made such a big deal about their cookies. I would have preferred an option such as fruit or cheese and crackers. I don't really know what they are thinking with this. I would have given them a 10 if not for the snack issue.",7alaska-airlines,11/07/15,"LAX-SEA on the 737-800. Flew on 4th of July and the atmosphere on-board was festive and friendly. Flight attendants interacted with the passengers. Purser was lovely. The crew was probably one of the best and most friendly I have flown with. They went above and beyond when I realized I had left my jacket at the lounge and made sure I got it back. Seats comfortable with plenty of space for the 2-hour flight. Food and beverage selection was extensive. Excellent snack of pasta with marinara sauce, beans, along with with a salad which was fresh. Overall, a wonderful flight. Good lounge, excellent service, great food and comfortable seats. ",10alaska-airlines,21/06/15,"Just returned to the Greatland having flown what is now my favorite airline once again. Departed ANC at 5 am and arrived ontime in SEA. I was bumped up to First due to my Gold status which I appreciate. The service was fine, the plane clean and all in all nothing to complain about. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon, a Q-400. No problems with anything here. If there was one thing though it would be the seats on the Q do not adjust at all. I wish they would but understand why they don't. The return trip was great on both legs. The crew was very impressive with their customer service. ",9alaska-airlines,18/05/15,Returned recently from a trip to SEA from ANC and SDF (on Am Eagle) to ORD then onto ANC. All flights were well run affairs with fine crews and great service. I flew First and when I get upgraded I always enjoy the experience. I am however more than pleased when I do not move up as the rest of the plane service crew does a fine job. I have yet to be unhappy with this airline since I have returned to using it on all my flights out and back to the Greatland. I have about six more flights scheduled in the next half year and I plan to fly them every time. Please keep it up!,9alaska-airlines,16/05/15,"Flight 893 9 May. I don't fly Alaska at all as my loyalties are with another airline at present because of frequent flier status. I flew last Saturday night at 9.45pm from Seattle to Oakland. What a difference in customer service. From the very start in the airport - their employees seemed gracious. The agents at the departure gate seemed relaxed and most affable as I watched them before our boarding call. My mainline carrier I usually fly - the employees always seem ""put out"" when they are interrupted from their computers. Inflight was pleasant. Flight attendants who seemed happy. If Alaska Airlines flew where I needed to go - they would have won me over.",10alaska-airlines,11/05/15,Flight AS838 on 6 May. Flew Alaska from Honolulu to Oakland on 6 May. I was not expecting much for the cost of the first class ticket and was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was not old (737-800) seat was spacious enough for a 5 hour day time flight. Meal was good and a nice linen service. Even the wine served was quite good and topped up regularly if you wished without having to ask. Crew were friendly and efficient. Even check in was quick and efficient. Overall a good experience and I think worth the extra for first class for this length flight. I rate it as highly as some domestic Australian business class flights I've had so it was quite good.,9alaska-airlines,27/04/15,Flew with family SJC-Honolulu then returned to SJC via Seattle. Economy Class. All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights. Availability of hot meals was inconsistent and confusing (available one direction but not the other on flights before 9 am or after etc.). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can. We once showed up 20 minutes before our departure time with boarding passes I had printed the night before and the plane had left already! They said they had paged us but we couldn't hear anything in that particular airport. Fortunately they had seats available on the next flight 2 hours later and got us on that for no charge.,8alaska-airlines,27/04/15,Upgraded to first class for our flight from SEA to DFW. Had seen Tom Douglas in the news lately talking his about the new menu he created for all Alaska flights. Our breakfast going down and dinner coming back was awful looking awful smelling and awful tasting. Many in 1st class that had the dinner on the return did not eat it. Even FA said she was embarrassed to be serving this meal. The spinach had a nasty smell to it.,8alaska-airlines,10/04/15,Flew First LA to Pueto Vallarta and had several issues. Firstly leg room was the poorest I'd experienced in first class ever. Secondly the cabin was far too cold and no rugs are supplied. Thirdly several passengers were allowed to remain in a reclined seat position for landing a safety issue. Lunch offered no choice - the chicken wedge salad was inedible. Luggage took well over the 20 minutes to arrive on the carousel. I could go on but let's just say I won't be flying with them again.,alaska-airlines,04/03/15,Kona - Oakland First class. What an improvement. Leaving United in the dust Alaska offers good food good service and decent leg room on this sector. Individual meals instead of all at one time distinguish this excellent offering from United using the same aircraft and only one hard working flight attendant. Finally a major carrier steps up and offers good service to and from Hawaii.,10alaska-airlines,04/03/15,Great service Seattle to Kona. Major upgrade in meal entertainment and attitude since last years trip. Keep it up Alaska you won me over.,10alaska-airlines,24/02/15,"I recently flew first class from Cancun Mexico to Seattle Washington. Having tried many times to upgrade and not having any luck I was excited that I finally got the chance. My boyfriend and I each used 10000 points to splurge on the trip home. I would never have done so if I knew how poor the service would be. Our steward was beyond rude. He offered no service whatsoever was totally unhelpful with any questions and hung out in the front away from the passengers. We had to ask for more water let alone a drink and when we did his attitude was atrocious. I realize first class isn't what it used to be but had I known what this would have been like I would have saved my points and stayed in coach I've had much better service there! Very disappointing for my first time going ""first class"".",1alaska-airlines,23/01/15,I had never flown Alaska before this past 2014-15 Christmas/New Year season. My fiancÃ© had relocated for work to Portland OR from Massachusetts. We had two cats to move and decided it would be best for them to fly with me in the cabin for the holiday. The operator who booked the flights with my fiancÃ© was so helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed to get the cats ready. When I got to Logan Airport in Boston I was allowed to board early with the cat carriers. When one of my cats started getting antsy in her carrier and I had the carrier in my lap the stewardesses asked if the kitties needed anything. There was no fuss or problems traveling with the cats. Check in was smooth and easy on both going and coming. The Alaska Airlines staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant which is such a change from the canned fake concern most airlines staff seem to have. The mileage club is so easy to use and keep track of miles. It is nice to see that customer service is still a virtue in some companies.,9alaska-airlines,21/01/15,"Yesterday January 19 2015 I flew Flight 16 from Seattle back to Orlando. It had been a round-about 48 hour visit to an ill relative and I was exhausted from having to rise in the wee hours AM to board coming and going on the only non-stop flight. It has been many years since I have seen flight attendants so ""up-beat"" and kind with a sense of humor in the face of a fully packed jumbo jet. And too many years since I have seen well-groomed stewardesses actively caring for each passenger. Accolades to Alaska Airlines for returning to a more gracious time during these chaotic ones.",10alaska-airlines,14/01/15,Travelled from Philadelphia to Maui via Seattle. Flew first class. After take off flight attendant stated that there were only 16 first class meals on board for the 16 first class seats. There were two choices of menu 8 each. She started taking orders at the front of the first class section and I was setting in the back when she got to me there were no choices left take the remaining selection or nothing. So I end up with nothing. She came back and offered me a cheese platter with 7 grapes and two so so cheeses and some crackers. Seats were standard first class seats which did not come close to lay flat. Hand held entertainment device did not work. Poor excuse for a first class flight.,5alaska-airlines,11/01/15,Returned early this morning from my flight Redmond to Seattle to Anchorage on Alaska in First. (upgraded). This flight was fine once we got into the air. Our plane had an issue or two which prevented an on time takeoff. We were about 70 minutes delayed but the crew did a fine job keeping everyone informed and did their usual fine job for the passengers. Paul was our employee in first and did an outstanding job great humor and fantastic work ethic. Even though we were late getting home to the Greatland nobody on board (from what I saw) griped about it. We were just glad to be back home.,9alaska-airlines,05/01/15,Flew LAX-SEA-BLI on B737-900. Took the offer of a first class upgrade for $50. Friendly attentive crew and a meal was served. I always find Alaska good value for the money. The only drawback is the constant PA's telling you how to do everything from how to stow your bag in the overhead to not using the call bell unless it's a medical emergency. All in all though a safe comfortable and reasonably priced service.,9alaska-airlines,05/01/15,"SEA to IAH return. First time flying on Alaska. Both legs were on time. Service was friendly. I appreciate the communication from the pilot or first officer with respect to turbulence and what's happening with the flight. Leg room was decent for economy class. Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections. Being a bit of a nervous flyer I generally tend to ask for 3 glasses of red wine when drink service is offered so I can slip slowly and make them last for a 4 hour flight and mellow out. One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display. For me it's a matter of simply selecting ""My Flight"" as I like to see the progress of the flight. Not possible with Alaska.",7alaska-airlines,05/01/15,Flew BLI-SEA-SNA. Bellingham to Seattle on Horizon Q400. No service offered on this sector. Comfortable flight. Only 45 minute connection time in Seattle however made it to the next gate with ease. Boarded the B737-700 from the tarmac in the cold pouring Seattle rain instead of via an airbridge. Crew were efficient but no smiles or interactions with the passengers. Legroom excellent for economy and seat very comfortable. Really convenient being able to fly into John Wayne airport. I fly with Alaska fairly often and always find their service comfortable reliable and good value for the money.,9alaska-airlines,29/12/14,Left Santa Ana late because plane arrived late. Had connection in Portland and we only had now 5 minutes to get from gate C to lower level gate A. Dozen or so people running to their gates. Luckily for us there were several flyers going to Eugene so the flight was held and even waited for luggage. Thank you Alaska Airlines for making the end of our vacation a happy ending.,10alaska-airlines,22/12/14,SEA-IAH first class 739 equipment. Boarding was fine and efficient. Left about ten minutes late due to catering not being available until last minute. Hit cruise 19 minutes into flight but it was fully an hour before FA served drinks. Nothing unusual going on so this was inexplicable. Service was friendly but very slow.,6alaska-airlines,10/12/14,Recently traveled for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego-Boston. It was the best domestic flight I have experienced. The 4 cabin crew members were excellent and very customer engaged with passengers needs. The flight wasn't full and they came to me and asked if I wanted a row of seats to myself to relax for the duration of the flight. The service was great 3 rounds of snack and beverage service for the 5-hour flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 and the legroom was great. A job well done. I look forward to flying onboard in the near future. The only downfall to Alaska Airlines is they charge $10.00 for a video recorder to watch the movies. There should be no charge for that as it should be complimentary since snacks sandwiches and alcohol are charged to the customer.,10alaska-airlines,10/12/14,12/1/14 ORD-SEA Flt 29. Arrived at the airport about 1.5 hours early. Only 1 agent at the counter. Waited about 15 mins before another agent appeared to assist. Once there it went smoothly and quickly. Boarding was efficient and able to be seated quickly. We were issued their digiplayers. Fair selection of movies to view but really no place to put the player when the meal arrived. A bit cumbersome. Meal offered was one choice only. It was tasty but portions have certainly been scaled back. Flight attendant disappeared after the meal service. Arrived on time. However I remember Alaska having a far superior service to that of its rivals but this flight did not prove that at all.,3alaska-airlines,10/12/14,12/4/14 SEA to ORD Flt 22. When checking in one has to perform a self bag tag and then take the luggage to the check in desk. There were 2 of us - we had 1 bag to check. It was over by 4lbs but since you are allowed two pieces of luggage per person we were well with in the weight limit. Too bad cost $75. Flight departed on time. Staff were friendly service was standard. Same meal offered on both segments but yet again nothing remarkable that would make me select this carrier over the competition. Once meal was served and one refresher of drinks the FA disappeared. I was disappointed with the overall service. It is not what I was accustomed to. A digiplayer for the entertainment was handed out but it is cumbersome to have on your tray table when the meal is served.,3alaska-airlines,04/12/14,SEA-LAX. Standard seating food etc for a 2.5 hour flight. As first class has an advantage over others in that you get access to their airline club even if you are flying just domestic and not connecting to an international flight (and aren't a club member). Alaska has both refundable and non-refundable first class fares. Non-refundable is about 1/2 the cost of the refundable but is not available on all routes (e.g. we were going to fly to BUR but only fc fare was refundable so we chose to fly to LAX instead).,8alaska-airlines,01/12/14,Traveled first class San Diego to Boston on 11/20/14. Plane left on time clean friendly flight attendants good breakfast and service and champagne. No complaints and felt it worth the money.,9alaska-airlines,11/11/14,Flew one of the Alaska/Horizon regional routes PDX-MFR night flight. The flight was originally at 9.05-ish but was delayed to 9.55. Got info 3 hours ahead of time and we still boarded late because traffic on the taxiway. Once aboard seats were fairly comfy flight attendants were friendly easily accommodated my sister's severe nut allergy made sure no nut-containing items were aboard the plane (standard airline safety procedure) and served two drinks for a flight less than an hour. Not bad Alaska.,7alaska-airlines,28/10/14,10-12-14 early flight SMF to SEA. Seats were thin but comfortable legroom seemed a bit more generous than the space I'm used to on other carriers seats had power outlets. I flew Alaska as part of a Delta flight from SMF- SEA-DTW-TVC the ticket purchased with my spouse's frequent flyer miles. I would choose to fly Alaska again over another airline even if the ticket price was higher. The aircraft didn't have entertainment. The food selection looked decent although I didn't buy any.,8alaska-airlines,28/10/14,Flew Alaska MCI to SEA return in First. Both legs were pleasant but the service on the outbound leg got off to a slow start with no pre-take off beverage offered. However once we were in the air the flight attendant was very quick to begin beverage service. Seats were comfortable but the pitch was a little tight I wish Alaska would invest in some bigger planes for their longer cross country flights in order to have a larger First Class cabin. Food was very good served plated and fresh. Check In both in Kansas City and Seattle was extremely easy and the Board Room in Seattle was pleasant. For a full fare ticket it wasn't an overall bad experience but felt that I overpaid slightly for what I got. Will fly Alaska First again in December and am looking forward to gaining elite status with them. Their mileage earning partnerships cannot be beat and I love that I can fly Delta American British Airways and Emirates as needed and still earn miles.,9alaska-airlines,12/10/14,Flew from SFO to ANC to SFO with stopover in SEA on 5th and 13th September 2014. These were routine flights. There were no delays in fact each leg was a few minutes ahead of schedule and baggage came out in the first few minutes. The Champagne and Beer was cold the food was really just snacks as we travelled in between normal mealtimes. This was good value as we were allowed 2 pieces of luggage each. I would definitely recommend this airline.,9alaska-airlines,01/10/14,My wife and I travelled to SEA and return to ANC recently on Alaska. No issues at all problem wise. Both flights were fine crews were great lanes clean on time arrivals etc. I tried to upgrade to First as I am a MVP Gold member but alas no luck. Maybe next time. I told my spouse it is a nice experience and she was hoping to see it firsthand. Anyhow keep up the good work and thanks Alaska.,9alaska-airlines,01/10/14,Took Alaska to Cabo on Sept 15th Alaska stated flight is still going. Get to San Diego Cabo flight still going. 30 minutes later our flight is cancelled. Alaska says no seats open back to Seattle tough luck. Find out the Cabo airport was shut down the day before and Alaska flew us to San Diego knowing this.,1alaska-airlines,14/09/14,I had a flight scheduled from ATL-SEA and the day of it was cancelled. So just four hours before my flight I was scrambling to get another flight that day.. Not only that but they didn't even send an alert that the flight was cancelled. My google alerts notified me about the cancellation. The customer service is non-existent and I will never book with them again. Book at your own risk!,alaska-airlines,09/09/14,Returned last week from a ANC-SEA-ATL and return in First. No complaints with the flights at all. As usual (for me) the service was outstanding the planes clean and the flight crews were very friendly. We were told we would be departing ATL about an hour late due to a crew rest issue. This would cause me to miss my connection to ANC in Seattle. I was rebooked quickly by the ATL folks. I caught my flight with minutes to spare in SEA but of course my bag did not show until the next flight. The Alaska employee at baggage claim was tired and a bit grumpy but I was given a coupon for 2500 miles and that was fine with me. Besides this issue all was great. Looking forward to our next flight to SEA this Thursday evening.,9alaska-airlines,01/09/14,We have just arrived back in New Zealand after our Alaskan cruise and would like to commend Alaska Airlines customer service desk for their excellent and sympathetic response to out late arrival due to tardy shuttle service resulting in our late arrival at LAX airport. We were very stressed as were to travel to Seattle the staff member advised that although our flight hadn't quite left it was indeed too late to get on but immediately advised that they had a flight every hour and could get us on the next flight. After all this there was no extra charges for this change we were so impressed with that.,10alaska-airlines,01/09/14,Alaska is our airline of choice. MCI-SEA-ANC flights generally good and on time. New Sky interior slimline Recaro seats (a bit uncomfortable). On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat. All in all we have been satisfied with Alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines.,9alaska-airlines,28/08/14,I flew Alaska non-stop from Dallas to Portland first class. The crew were very friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We had an hour delay after boarding the aircraft in Dallas but the crew kept everybody informed and kept serving drinks and a small snack for us. Very impressed with their first class service.,10alaska-airlines,28/08/14,"Recently flew on Alaska Airlines with my 2 longer legs (TUS to SEA and ANC to PDX) in First Class. On these flights (along with the other 2 segments) the flight and flight crew were fine. My complaint is with what defines ""First Class"" to Alaska Airlines. On TUS-SEA our meal consisted of a chicken sandwich and a chocolate mint! No inflight entertainment devices provided. On the ANC-PDX segment (which was 2.45 Alaska time to 7am PDX time). No wake-up breakfast which meant zero food provided at all. Flight attendant asked if we wanted anything as we were already in the process of pre-landing operations. And since an overnight flight no inflight entertainment. Guess I'm expecting too much for paying for a first class seat.",8alaska-airlines,28/08/14,"Flying from Soldotna AK we were fogged in. In only takes a short while for fog to burn off but they delayed the flight twice and then canceled it. I had the option to either have a 12 hour layover in Anchorage or spend the night in Seattle's airport. After waiting 3 hours I was flown to Anchorage. I had 100lbs of frozen fish I worked hard catching. Alaska air refused to help in any way. No mailing my fish home no putting it in a freezer. They refused to put me in a hotel to sleep no options whatsoever. I called them and the woman told me ""We can't pick up the tab for every act of God"" and ""this happens all the time."" Once in Anchorage I tried to switch to the flight where I stay overnight in Seattle because someone I knew had a freezer and I could stay there. Customer service said 1 seat was left while asking her supervisor permission the seat was taken. I took the next flight 4 hours later only to find out the freezer was unavailable so late at night. So I was sent by customer service to get my fish from baggage (it was checked) then come back. I did and asked again to change to the plan to layover 12 hours in Anchorage. I went and waited in line again. I got my fish into the freezer in Anchorage for 28$ not bad but I shouldn't have to pay for that. 3 hours in Soldotna 12 hours in Anchorage a red-eye flight to Seattle then another 3 hour lay-over until my next flight home which is only a 2.5 hour drive. I was so exhausted. I can't believe this happens all the time and everyone lets them get away with this.",alaska-airlines,28/08/14,My first flight from Vancouver to Seattle was great - the crew were fantastic. However my flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City was not very enjoyable. I found the crew to be lazy and rude. I tried to order a beverage on the plane and they had closed out early (1 hour early) and right after they had passed with the drink cart. I've flown before and unless there is turbulence then typically a plane will serve you until about 30 minutes before landing. One flight attendant was very rude. I usually love flying Alaska and was about to apply for my Alaska Air credit card but this was very disappointing. I think I may hold back on applying because of this particular experience.,4alaska-airlines,26/08/14,This week on my trip to Seattle I flew Alaska Airlines when in the past I would normally fly United. Alaska Airlines far exceeded my expectations. If I could use them to fly everywhere I would. The flight attendants actually seemed happy and were very nice. The seats were extremely comfortable - much more comfortable than other flights that I've been on. The plane was clean. I will definitely fly with Alaska Airlines anytime I can.,10alaska-airlines,18/08/14,We flew from Maui to Seattle with a connection in Seattle to Washington D.C. First the plane leaving Maui was delayed for over 3 hours. Alaska Airlines took us off our connecting flight without telling us (Seattle to D.C.) and booked us on a much later flight. Thank goodness I checked before departing from Maui. I was told that they didn't think there would be enough time to make the connection. I asked for them to get me on another flight/airline where I wasn't waiting for my connection for five or more hours. They couldn't do this I was told. I demanded to be put back on the earlier connection and told them I would attempt to make the connection although I had less than 30 minutes to do so. I was told that my seats were already taken by someone else. I informed them that tickets had been given to me already for my seats and they had better get me back on that plane. After some time they did get me back onto the connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. The plane from Maui to Seattle took off several hours late and it did not have very good air conditioning. The plane was hot poor service and I was not impressed at all with Alaska Airlines. I will never fly with them again. The connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. was also very hot on the plane. Don't fly Alaska Airways. Go with another carrier such as United Delta or American Airlines.,alaska-airlines,05/08/14,Flight was supposed to depart at 1.30pm from Seattle to Long Beach but it didn't. For the first hour the flight was delayed because one of the aircraft crew was lateâ€ù Then we were told the flight was delayed for another 3 hours. I could not wait any longer. I requested to be put on another available flight to California. I was placed on flight # 464Y Seattle to Los Angeles with departure time at 7.25 pm. I wasted 6 hours of my time and I had to pay an extra fee to rent a car from LAX area and pay with higher rate. I arrived in a hotel at 11.30 pm. The trip to Long Beach took me 12 hours instead of 5 hours. I would be OK with this if the flight back to Seattle had not been canceled too. Flight 3477 from Long Beach to Seattle with departure time at 7.25 pm was canceled because of some engine problems. At 11.00 pm I was told that the aircraft would not be fixed any soon and all hotels around Long Beach and LAX were booked. I had to take a taxi to LAX and had to sleep on the bench in LAX airport so I could finally fly to Seattle on the 6am flight. It was the worst experience in flight and I am flying for business a lot.,alaska-airlines,02/08/14,Flew LAX to DCA. Delay leaving LAX due to air traffic congestion but was kept informed. The seats were pretty uncomfortable considering this was a 5+ hours flight. I was very glad that I purchased a 'comfort seat' alongside as I was coming off a 15 hour flight from Australia and had space to spread out. The cabin crew were lovely and most helpful. We had a strange delay in DCA as we arrived 2 hours late due to earlier delay and adverse weather around DC and the Alaska gate was taken by another Alaska plane and we ended up waiting around 30 minutes on the tarmac for space to be found. Would use them again but would definitely purchase the comfort seat for added space.,7alaska-airlines,02/08/14,We traveled home from Las Vegas on Tuesday July 29. Our plane was 4.5 hours late and I cannot say enough how great the Alaska Airline staff were . They were very helpful apologetic and kept us informed the entire time on what the updates were on our flight and when we could expect to take off. We really appreciated the positive attitude and genuine care of their employees. It made the inconvenience of having to wait for our flight much easier and very helpful.,10alaska-airlines,02/08/14,Just returned from my trip south ANC-SEA-EUG and returned EUG-PDX-ANC. All flights were fine the crews were all professional clean aircraft on time and the food was quite decent. We had quite a few young children flying back to Alaska with their parents from 3 months of age up to five in my section. The flight attendants were very helpful and appeared to enjoy the interaction with the little ones. I flew the 400 model combi south for the first time. Not bad at all for a red eye flight. All in all a fine experience.,9alaska-airlines,29/07/14,July 24th. Flew SLC-SFO in the morning and returned the same evening. Best short haul domestic experience this year. Boarding handled smoothly. Flight crew extremely polite and courteous. Cabin nice clean and the temp. Was well controlled. Both flights on perfect time. Will try to fly more with Alaska if possible.,9alaska-airlines,20/07/14,Flew from Orlando on 5/29/14. Flying from Tampa to Seattle on 8/9/14 and returning on 8/31/14. Crew were attentive friendly and a pleasure to spend 5.5 hours with. Food was fresh warm and tasty. I am so happy they added round trip non-stop Tampa to Seattle. Absolutely perfect for me.,10alaska-airlines,12/07/14,PHX-SEA and back. The crew signed my Alaska Airlines history book they all chatted with me and seemed in good spirits. The flight was handled smoothly and the drinks and food was generous considering what we got was being offered free (sandwiches however cost 6 dollars on economy class).,10alaska-airlines,08/07/14,Flew from Los Angeles to Anchorage on Alaska 149. The flight left and arrived in destination on time. The purchase food quality and quantity were OK. The drinks provided during the flight are more than adequate. The service was nice.,7alaska-airlines,06/07/14,Plane delayed due to mechanical trouble. So they re-routed another flight and changed the direction of the flight and the stops although still ending up in Seattle where we were headed. So instead of leaving around 11am we left more like at 4pm. At our first stop in Wrangel some people got on. Then some more. Then a few more. After a while the crew started counting passengers. Then did it again. And again. Then they started asking names as well as counting. Then did that again. And again. And again. As far as I could tell they never found any trouble and never made anyone leave the plane. Then they said we were overweight and had to unload some fuel. After that they started counting and naming again. When I asked if they be serving dinner since it was now after 4 and we wouldn't get to Seattle until after at least 9 pm they said they had 4 wraps on board to sell. The CSA then came on the plane and yelled at me for delaying the plane! For asking if we'd get fed! More than an hour after that harangue we left. We arrived in Seattle around 1 am hungry.,alaska-airlines,23/06/14,ANC to SLC return in First both directions. I have no complaints whatsoever. The food was fine the service was excellent on-time both directions and the plane was clean. Their SLC growth (# of flights to and from there) has not affected their great customer service negatively as far as I could tell. One thing which was different on the return flight though was that the flight attendant came around prior to our landing and thanked each customer for flying with Alaska and I felt she meant it. It was a small but very classy thing to do as I have never seen this before. It is the small but kind gestures that help make a difference when I fly. Keep it up Alaska!,9alaska-airlines,09/06/14,PSP-PDX-LAX. Two flights with Alaska both of which were on time departures and arrivals. Friendly cabin crew adequate legroom. All in all a good experience.,9alaska-airlines,04/06/14,In May I flew with the airline three times: San Francisco to Seattle at the start of my visit then a return flight at the end. In between I flew from Palm Springs to Seattle with the airline. All were good and timely. My main comments are words of praise for the check-in team at Seattle at the start of my return flight when they worked long and diligently to ensure my luggage in the hold was correctly tagged directly back to my home airport in Perth Australia for that 21-hour flight via Hong Kong.,9alaska-airlines,01/06/14,I flew from Seattle to Anchorage on a 737-800 with the new slimline Recaro seats. Each seat had a power outlet with a USB port and the seats were very comfy with an adjustable head rest and more legroom compared to the old seats. I noticed that there was no longer a barrier between first class and coach but maybe they will install it later. I had 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi thanks to a partnership with Allstate. I tested the speed at 2 Mb/sec download and 0.25 Mb/sec upload. I rented an entertainment player for $8 and had time to watch a movie along with a few other clips. The devices are a little slow and touchy but are still functional. Soon Alaska Airlines will offer entertainment on your own iPads laptops etc. I purchased the chicken dinner for $6 which consisted of boneless chicken breast mashed potatoes and green beans and actually tasted very good. The drink cart went around 2 times during the 3 hour flight and the second time I had delicious orange Tazo tea. Overall a great experience with great service all around!,10alaska-airlines,29/05/14,Just back from my 3 week tour of the Lower 48 using Alaska from ANC-SEA-ATL return in First. All aspects of my various flights went smoothly. Very enjoyable experience. Flight crews were attentive clean aircraft arrival times early on most of the flights and the food was quite good as well. No complaints at all. Heading south again in two weeks to SCL. Looking forward to the Alaskan Experience once again.,9alaska-airlines,25/05/14,My Wife and I have used various Airlines in USA fairly extensively over the years. First time on Alaskan and can only highly recommend them. Service from check in Kerbside to arrival destination was perfect and should ever we visit USA again will use them if opportunity exists.,10alaska-airlines,07/05/14,Just back from a trip from ANC to Portland then SMF and return. We departed about 40 minutes late from ANC due to a switch issue but made up for it enroute. We had a medical emergency also but the passenger was given oxygen and was well cared for by the crew. Horizon provided the flight south to Sacramento and that was fine in all regards. The trip back was nearly perfect. My only issue is the waiting room in Portland it is a zoo! Otherwise - great!,9alaska-airlines,01/05/14,Flew SEA to SAN in April. Absolutely flawless. Check in was simple and hassle free. Once onboard all cabin crew were so pleasant. Repeated drinks service throughout the flight. One passenger taken ill the crew were reaching out for doctors onboard and they also stood by. Plenty of legroom in economy. Aircraft 737-800 seemed brand new. Interior was clean and fresh. Baggage was on the belt in no time despite it was a short walk from the gate to the belt. Absolutely on top of my choice among American carriers.,10alaska-airlines,23/04/14,I flew Palm Springs to Portland. We departed Palm Springs 5.5 hours late due to a wind/dust storm. The crew were fantastic. We were on and off the plane a couple of times. The passengers never got cranky because of the high degree of professionalism and good vibes from the crew. I have never had a bad flight on Alaska and it is always my first choice.,10alaska-airlines,22/04/14,"Returned last week from my annual trip to Reno from ANC. The flight out was fine good service clean plane and landed a few minutes early in SEA. The flight to RNO was great on Horizon good crew with great service. The only complaint I have are the gates at Portland for the ""Seattle Shuttle"" are pretty crammed together and I accidentally tried to board the wrong flight. The gate agent pointed this out to me and was a bit short attitude wise. I asked about how many flights are leaving at 3.30? She said ""one at that time and the one you are on starts to board at that time and leaves at 4! I was not the only person who had this issue but no problem after that. I got to SEA and the flight home to ANC was fine. I will be flying them again this next Monday going to SMF. I expect my flights will be fine.",8alaska-airlines,21/04/14,SEA-KOA my first ever flight with Alaska. Check-in at SEA was quick and efficient. Onboard I was positively surprised by the seat pitch; much more leg room than on most other airlines (and I am quite tall). Flight itself was partly bumpy due to weather but the crew cheered everyone up with free Mai Tais shortly before reaching Hawaii. Never had that with any other airline. Flight was on time the food for purchase was OK. Overall a very good experience. Will certainly use them again.,9alaska-airlines,13/04/14,My first experience with Alaska Airlines. I didn't expect the level of service from the stewards onboard. My two young sons myself and my wife traveled from Edmonton to Seattle and then to Honolulu. The stewards dealing with objectionable passengers children running up and down the aisle were professional and polite. I was able to extend my legs into the aisle without being harassed to remove them. On return bad weather delayed our connection.,9alaska-airlines,13/04/14,Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers. Cabin crew's apologies were sincere and they did their best to make it up for me.,7alaska-airlines,06/04/14,Flew first class from JFK to San Diego flight 769 on April 1. And it did feel like an April Fool return to 1955. No pocket with safety info and sick bag no blankets or pillows provided stewardesses never once went through to collect trash. Food was allergy-unfriendly with bowl of mixed nuts for appetizer and a nut topped parfait for dessert. Worst of all though was the feeling of no safety consciousness. The two stewardesses functioned as - hostesses. Three young men each kept coming up repeatedly to ask a question use the bathroom get a soft drink. The boys would stay in the food prep area for several minutes chatting and then linger in the first class cabin to perform stretching exercises. On all other airlines that I've been on this kind of thing is just unheard of. I would not fly this airline again.,alaska-airlines,28/03/14,Rebooked onto Alaska due to cancellation of my original flight on UA from SEA to LAX. The aircraft was pretty worn (737-400) and the IFE non-existent. The legroom was frightening. Once the pax in front of me reclined my knees were against his seat for the duration. Cabin crew were good and service was perfunctory. However I could've done without the 5 minute announcement ploy for their credit card and corresponding benefits (not to mention the FA walking down the aisle with applications). Got me from point to point but I have to say I wasn't really that impressed.,5alaska-airlines,03/03/14,Had our reservations with other connecting flights and rental cars for 3 days on Oahu and 7 days on Maui this coming June. We were very excited! Then we checked our itineraries and Alaska Airlines cancelled our return flight #883. Alaska re-booked our Honolulu departure 12 hours earlier but we would not get back from Maui to catch it until 8 hours later. They gave us 2 choices: the earlier flight or full refund. Very nice Alaska especially considering the inter island flight is non-cancellable nor are the rental cars etc. Since we made non- cancellable tickets and obtained a confirmation from Alaska I will not ever trust them again.,alaska-airlines,17/02/14,February 1 2014. Flight 381 from SEA (Seattle) to SMF (Sacramento). I paid the extra $50 for a first class upgrade. The upgrade was worth the $50.00 although leg room wasn't what I would have expected (I was in 1D behind the bulkhead). The food and complimentary wine were good the service competent. I would recommend Alaska based on my first class travel experience.,9alaska-airlines,17/02/14,I am an Alaska Gold 75K and due to all the flight time I am seeing an increasing amount of maintenance holds delays and flight impact due to demand maintenance. On a flight from SEA to PSP that was on gate hold for 30 minutes due to a cockpit printer malfunction. The pilots PA circuit also malfunctioned with very loud audio noise in the background that made his communication to the cabin almost inaudible. Given the monthly frequency of gate hold maintenance events I am seeing as a passenger I am concerned about the competency funding and oversight of their maintenance program.,5alaska-airlines,20/01/14,Seattle-Kodiak-Seattle. Very nice trip. Airline personnel were friendly and efficient. Only minor complaint is that the seats hardly tip back.,9alaska-airlines,29/12/13,I flew from San Jose California to Seattle. The service was ok the plane was on-time. Boarding was delayed 2 mins but we arrived in Seattle 15 minutes before schedule. Two weeks later I flew from Seattle to Los Angeles - it was a connecting flight perfect again. The service of the crew members were good the flight was on-time again and no problems with the baggage. It went directly to my final destination (Guadalajara Mexico). Both aircraft's were Boeing 737-900 they were very clean and comfortable the legroom was ok. If I can I will fly with them again.,9alaska-airlines,20/12/13,June 2013. One flight from LAX to SEA and another a few days later from ANC to LAX. Friendly and professional crew (on board and at the airport) modern aircraft (B737-800 and B737-900/ER) departure and arrival on time luggage recovered 5 minutes after arrival. I would say only one thing: Next time I will fly with Alaska Airlines again! An excellent low cost company.,10alaska-airlines,19/12/13,"I have been flying Alaska for many years. For the last several years I have been flying first class only and have been very satisfied with the food the service and the extra space. This last trip though made me wonder if I should continue to pay the substantial difference in price to be in first class. It was the space in the new plane. The space between me and the seat in front is closer. I had to struggle to get my bag under the seat in front of me when the passenger in front of me had his seat back. I'm 5'5' and 125 lbs. Also there used to be three big spaces under the 1st class seats for two people. Now there are two with one other smaller space big enough to fit a purse maybe. I don't like to use the overhead but I can change. There still seemed to be plenty of space between me and the passenger next to me. I like the three moveable light fixtures and the ability to direct air flow on the ceiling better. The food is still good and the service good. Although staff service on the majority of my flights has been ""excellent"" I can only honestly rate this last trip as ""fair."" I am grateful to her though for this information. I heard her tell the two passengers in front of me that staff call the new planes ""slaveships"" because there are 44 more seats (!) but no more staff (still 4) to serve passengers. She said something to the effect of ""I feel sorry for the people in back. They get served so late or barely at all."" I'm thinking that on my next trip coming up shortly I will go coach one way just to see if I can still justify paying the difference in price. But thanks to the overheard words of the staff attendant I will sit in the middle or closer to the front in coach so that I will get better service and won't have to wait forever. I will also plan to bring on board some food and a beverage. Overall I really like Alaska although I haven't flown any others for a long time. Maybe I will venture onto another airline just to compare. I never have trouble checking in no lost luggage airport gate staff friendly and professional. There are a lot of things I like about Alaska.",8alaska-airlines,16/12/13,My time on Alaska airlines was ok. I was flying from Sacramento California to Seattle Washington. The flight attendants were nice and cheerful. The flight left on time and the flight attendants gave us a bag of beef jerky for the inflight meals. We ended up landing about 10 minutes early and the only thing I recommend is that they add inflight entertainment otherwise I recommend that you fly with Alaska.,9alaska-airlines,09/12/13,I often fly on Alaska/Horizon flights between Montana and Seattle or Portland. My overall experiences have been very good. Flights even in winter have been on time and counter and plane staff have always been excellent. Value is very good compared with the few other carriers (Delta and United) that we have to choose from here in Montana. Seats on Alaska planes could be more comfortable as they are small and fairly stiff and uncomfortable but most flights are short so it is not a big issue for me. You can't carry on larger bags on the smaller planes but their a la cart process still allows me not to have to check in my carry on and pick it up after landing. Overall my satisfaction with Alaska is very good.,9alaska-airlines,03/12/13,Absolutely awful service. I missed a flight to Honolulu for business because my connecting flight (also an Alaska Airlines flight) was 25 minutes late arriving. I got to the departure gate for Honolulu in time to see the plane sit there for a few minutes before pushing back if only they have held the plane 5-10min so me and the half dozen other connecting passengers could make the flight. Worse yet they offered no hotel or even club accommodations even thought this was the last flight out and it was entirely the airline's fault that we didn't make the connectionâ€”service reps said it wasn't their problem since they were 'only' 20min late and blamed my booking. I'll never fly Alaska Airlines again.,2alaska-airlines,02/12/13,LAX-YVR-LAX. On the flight to YVR we were greeted with great service at the gate. The aircraft was nice and clean and had a lot of legroom on the B737-400. Even though we were delayed a bit we still had a good flight. The service was great. We had complimentary drinks and the food a cheese plate was delicious and was worth the $7 dollar price. On the flight out to LAX we were delayed from 6am to 11.45am due to maintenance issues. Because of this they rebooked all of the people traveling to Mexico and the first class passengers. They also gave $40 breakfast vouchers. This proves excellent service. Also the first officer took us on a tour of the cockpit which was really nice. Since so many people left this flight onto a flight to Mexico the flight was almost empty. The seats were very comfortable on the Boeing 737-400 and the food and service were great as well especially because they were handing out every order for free due to the delay. Because of this Alaska Airlines is a great airline and I definitely recommend.,10alaska-airlines,27/11/13,Round trip Seattle to Fort Lauderdale family of 4 for a cruise Nov 8 return 16th. Great experience considering we go in with low expectations our own food iPads etc. I was watching the on-time performance for a few weeks prior to departure and it seems this flight leaves the gate early more often than being on-time and our experience was no different - we pushed off 10-15 mins early both coming and going. Crew were experienced polite and helpful. 3 drink cart visits for the 6 hour flight with in-between bottled water. Gate checked our carry-ons for free. All good.,9alaska-airlines,04/11/13,Long Beach - Seattle Friday 25 Oct. An excellent experience with Alaska check in at Long Beach was easy and the flight boarded on time for an on time departure. The cabin crew were excellent throughout the flight.,10alaska-airlines,04/11/13,Seattle - Redmond - Seattle 26 Oct. This year chose to fly rather than drive and good decision. Easy check in at Seattle plane on time and boarding very efficient. Whilst short fly cabin crew were excellent and arriving at Redmond was a delight only plane on ramp and backs in 6/7 mins. Return flight equally as good with on time departure and great team on board. Would certainly choose Alaska again based upon my recent experiences.,10alaska-airlines,25/10/13,Very pleasant flight that I expect to make frequently visiting daughter in Bend Oregon. Friendly and helpful staff: Went back to plane to recover my jacket. But I have 2 complaints: Elderly neighbor got a $65 ticket when he pulled over in the loading zone to answer my call on his cell (that I was late) and Alaska's Seattle wait room sure looked shabby. Otherwise a very good experience.,9alaska-airlines,25/10/13,Recently returned from ANC-ATL-ANC in first class. I was quite pleased overall with not only the service attitudes of the cabin crew but also the layout of the B-900. The flights were all on time and the food was actually quite good. The crew from ANC to SEA (red-eye) was great with a flair for humor. I do not always travel upfront unfortunately but decided to give it a go wish I could do it every flight. No complaints here. I will continue to use Alaska.,9alaska-airlines,25/10/13,I have flown several times with Alaskan Airlines over the past few years. I am Canadian and live 2.5 hrs from Spokane Washington. I have found all employees to be polite and helpful over the phone at check-in or while flying. I did have a flight delay in January but all passengers were kept informed of what was going on. I much prefer Alaskan Air over Air Canada. I will be flying with Alaskan again on Nov 6/13 to Hawaii.,10alaska-airlines,23/10/13,Round trip Seattle to Houston. Everything as expected on time friendly crew arrived back in Seattle 30 minutes early. Have flown Alaska at least once a year for the past 10 years have never had a late flight or lost luggage. Companion fare is a great deal $99.00 + tax anywhere they fly. If you don't like the seats in back quit whining and pony up the money to sit up front.,8alaska-airlines,20/10/13,My main issue is the check in. Flight from SMF to PDX was on the small propeller jet. Those do not have overhead room for normal overhead luggage. But they don't tell you. Hence you are forced to tag bags at the gate and place on cart for checking just like regular checked bags. What if you had something temperature sensitive. It's stupid not to inform customers that the plane does not have normal overhead storage. On the return flight it took half hour to check bags because the airline was understaffed line oppressively long. If I fly Alaska again I will bring a backpack only that's sure to fit in the tiny overhead compartment. Tell us if we get normal overhead. That's all I ask.,5alaska-airlines,13/10/13,I've flown close to 50000 miles this year - all on Alaska Airlines. I've been flying Alaska for 15 plus years. Most of my travel is up and down the west coast with a NY Boston Orlando Chicago trip thrown in on occasion. Overall Alaska has done an amazing job all around. I've had one bag go missing in the last 15 years. It showed up at my door before 8 am the next morning. The food choices are excellent in coach and the few times I've been in First Class it's been wonderful. Their beverage choices are extensive and you can purchase an entertainment system on flights over 2 hours. Alaska's flight attendants are great - very friendly and accommodating and most of them have a great sense of humor! The few times I've had to fly other airlines I've discovered there is no comparison.,10alaska-airlines,10/10/13,I had not flown with Alaska Airlines for a number of years but had a good experience previously. I had a 6 leg trip this past week from LAX to ANC to FAI to Cordova to JNU and to SIT then finally to SEA. Every trip was on time or ahead of schedule. FA were attentive and polite. F&B service was good. I had the food purchase options on 2 flights and was very pleased. Not overly priced and was fresh with good flavor. Only downside was in LAX boarding was chaotic. Gate agent shows up 5 minutes before boarding so many confused passengers. On all flights I noticed the upholstery on the seats were quite worn. A little surprised when most flight were on 737-700 or 800 series aircraft. Anyway all in all a successful trip with Alaska Airlines. Flights on time and my baggage made every flight. I would certainly endorse Alaska Airlines.,9alaska-airlines,01/10/13,Recently flew Alaska from Anchorage to SEA and then down to Redmond OR to take our daughter to college. The trip down was fine in all respects good service new 737-900 and on time. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon and they did fine as well. The return trip was Redmond to Portland then up to Anchorage again no problems. We departed a bit late from Portland due to a windshield wiper problem but due to the upper level winds due to the massive rainstorm in Portland we were just a few minutes late arriving in ANC. All in all good job all the way around by all crews and staff. I will fly them shortly to ATL and we will see how they do in First.,8alaska-airlines,24/09/13,I was not looking forward to 6 hours in a 737 from Seattle to Kona in first. In actuality the trip was not bad at all. Decent leg room and meal service were all complemented by a hard working and friendly flight attendant who serviced 20 people on her own. Digi player was decently loaded for entertainment. By today's lowered standards this flight was quite nice.,9alaska-airlines,15/09/13,SEA-ANC-SEA KTN-JNU JNU-ANC-HNL in B737s during the month of August. Managed to get a Row 6 seat in each of them which led to being offered priority boarding. Every flight was either on time or ahead of schedule. Excellent in-flight service. This is an exceptional American carrier in the north-west of the country. Being slugged twice for baggage despite travelling on a single itinerary was the sole gripe.,9alaska-airlines,05/09/13,LAX-PDX. Very good early morning flight to PDX. Cabin a little tired and cramped but service was some of the best. The breakfast was actually really good - eggs benedict and bloody mary's. First time flying them and would again. They need to upgrade there interior product though as looks worn.,8alaska-airlines,28/08/13,Flights Bellingham to Honolulu in Coach. Seats are tight but that's the sign of the times. Service was sparse. You are nickeled and dimed on everything now. Gone are the days of Wardair. Guess that's why they aren't in business. Miss the days when air flight was fun. Having said that out flights we good and we didn't really expect much more for the price we paid. Would take this trip with Alaska Air again.,8alaska-airlines,26/08/13,Upgraded to First Class from JNU to ANC for $50 (1.5 hour flight). This was my 1st First Class experience and I was not impressed. Water was offered before take off. The plane was a slightly aged 737-400. At first the seats seem okay but they hardly recline and there is no adjustable headrests. This makes the seats unsuitable for sleeping in. There was also a lot less legroom than I was expecting. I wouldn't recommend putting a bag under the seat in front of you unless it is very small. Since it was morning we were served breakfast. Our drinks were served first along with the standard snack bag that's also served in coach. Then the meals were served. The meal was an egg and bacon French toast sandwich. It was okay but not very filling. I was expecting more for first class.,8alaska-airlines,22/08/13,Horrible experience transferring from Flight 456 arriving in Los Angeles to Flight 4213 going to San Jose CA. Boarding pass said Skywest but it was actually American Eagle. On arrival at LAX there was no information about either Skywest no indication where it was located and no one who seemed to know. Asked a gate agent who told us it was terminal 8. She did not say it was American Eagle we were looking for. After much walking and asking several people a TSA agent said to go to gate 65 and take shuttle bus to American. Upon reaching American we were told to board another bus which took us to a building near but not even attached to terminal 8. The TSA agent and the individual opening the restricted zone for us at gate 65 along with the shuttle bus drivers were the only competent individuals who seemed to know that Skywest was American Eagle in this case.,alaska-airlines,18/08/13,Out of 6 flights on Alaska going from Santa Barbara to Kalispell Montana and back only one flight (S.B. to Portland) was even remotely on time. All the rest departed from a half to full hour after the scheduled time. This is the worst this experienced long time flyer has ever seen.,4alaska-airlines,11/08/13,Exceptional flight from PHL to SEA on Aug 6th. Everything from checking in online using the mobile app to the inflight experience was smooth cheerful and efficient. The new recaro seats in Y class was smartly designed and comfortable as Y class goes. Inflight crew were cheerful and chatty particularly the senior attendant. Virgin America has great amenities on transcon flights but I find Alaska to offer the best service!,10alaska-airlines,08/08/13,Flew from Bethel AK to Anchorage AK on a 737-400 Combi. Flight left on time and service was great. Flight attendants were very nice and smiled. I purchased a Mediterranean Tapas picnic pack for $6 and it was very good. A couple of days later flew from Anchorage AK to Juneau AK on a lei themed 737-800 which is rare for the route (usually only 737-400s are flown). It was nice having an adjustable headrest but I noticed that the seats on the 737-800 don't recline as much as the seats on the older 737-400. The flight was pretty empty with only 50 passengers. The flight attendants seemed tired and didn't smile as much but the service was still okay. Flight left on time. 737-400 Combi's don't have inflight Wi-Fi but all the 737-800s do for a charge of $4.95 for a single flight pass. Overall Alaska Airlines is a great airline.,8alaska-airlines,06/08/13,Departed on time from DCA bound for SEA on a 737-400 window seat 16 impossible to move in or out while other two passengers occupied their respective seats. The individual on the middle seat wore the most puzzling attitude making it absolutely awful to even attempt to exit for a loo break for the 4 plus hour trip. Blame the ludicrous spacing that makes it an absolute necessity to require other passengers to co0operate multiple times during a long flight. From SEA to JUN still a fully loaded aircraft yet uneventful and more pleasant neighbor passengers. JUN to final destination PSG a short hour long hop. A short 30 min delay at SEA. Return PSG by way of WRG then KTN imposed an hour an a half delay due not to weather. We arrived late night at SEA and then off to catch a ride to a local awful Seatac Inn for an overnight layover. Flight back to DCA was more pleasant. FA mobilized quickly to keep the full cabin stocked with minute free snacks beverages in cups and purchased meals. Entertainment was avail at 10 dollars for a shared small screen pad which battery quickly ran out of charge. The DCA to SEA is a long flight on a regularly cramped cabin. The spacing between seats is insufficient for a 155 lb. 6 ft. man to exit the window seat without interfering or annoying uncooperative passengers. It is difficult to hold biological needs for such long travel distances.,5alaska-airlines,17/07/13,LAX-ANC-LAX. Seats were very comfortable and the staff service was great. They even gave us free peanuts and cookies! Although all of these were good the in-flight entertainment is horrible. It is basically an IPad that you rent at $12. Not worth it. Overall this was a great airline. I would definitely fly Alaska Airlines again.,8alaska-airlines,15/07/13,I flew First Class from Palm Springs to San Francisco on July 7th. I have flown First Class on this route many times in the past with Alaska. In the past they had a great choice of salad or cheese plate on the flight with great service. Now they have totally eliminated that and didn't even bother to ask if anyone wanted a refill on their drink which they served with a cheap bag of pretzels. The flight attendant did everything possible not to walk in First Class but stayed in the galley doing nothing. Standards have gone down on Alaska.,alaska-airlines,09/07/13,Flew from San Jose to Fairbanks via Seattle. A good trip. Flight was on time. We knew no food was served so took our own. AA guarantee that if you don't receive your bags within 20 minutes of the plane arriving at the gate they will pay compensation ($20 I think). Our bags arrived within this time limit.,7alaska-airlines,08/07/13,We flew from Seattle to Las Vegas with a connection in Portland as a direct flight would have meant hanging around too long. As we live in UK we were nervous that flights would be delayed given some negative reviews here. Everything went smoothly and right on time. We were impressed with complimentary drinks service given that similar budget airlines in the UK all charge for drinks. Our return flight direct to Seattle was again on time . We found baggage check in quick and friendly and with the exception of one rather curt stewardess everyone else was absolutely fine.,10alaska-airlines,07/07/13,PHX-SEA-PHX. Service was great. They were on time. Boeing 737-800 both ways. I would recommend.,10alaska-airlines,01/07/13,SEA-ANC-ORD I consider my two experiences with this airline poor ones! The staff are friendly but flights are often delayed! On board crew seem lost this made me feel very uncomfortable these days you pay for everything extra when you fly them even for the bags. Won't be flying Alaska again unless the price is right.,4alaska-airlines,30/06/13,On time and even had two inflight beverage services from Los Angeles to Seattle. This was economy. On the way back to Los Angeles I flew First Class. Was nice to have a meal.,10alaska-airlines,26/06/13,"June 2013 LAX-MZT-LAX first class. Horrible check in. One first class line which is really 2 lines that mould into one. We stood for 20 minutes as the line grew longer. Whoever designed this lobby should be forced to deal with it on a busy day. When we finally got to the clerk he was surly if not down right rude. He did not speak two words to us. Off to the ""new"" first class lounge. Small cramped dark. Good bar but the small selection of food looked old and un-appealing. I certainly would not pay to get in. Indifferent staff. Boarding was quick and easy. However after it was announced the rear door had been ""armed"" the crew allowed a first class passenger off the plane to purchase an upgraded ticket for his grandson. So we all sat and waited at least ten minutes for him. Inflight the flight attendants on both trips were excellent: attentive friendly helpful. Nice folks. The food? On the way down a limp salad with what I think were chicken strips and a raspberry soda pop for dressing. On the way back inedible pesto chicken. Absolutely unacceptable for the price of a first class ticket. At MZT it took 35 minutes for our baggage to hit the belt. The counter people were slammed trying to check in outgoing passengers so it was impossible to hold Alaska to its 20 minute guarantee. All in all first class is definitely NOT worth the price and I would not recommend it.",alaska-airlines,26/06/13,I am retired and am fortunate enough to fly first class extensively and often on a variety of airlines both in the US and Europe. I recently flew first class with my wife round trip from Las Vegas to Anchorage and plan to never fly Alaska again. Every employee I had contact with was pleasant and courteous the planes were on time but the only benefit in flying first was the additional legroom. The outbound and inbound flights were 2 weeks apart but breakfast both mornings was the same and only thing what they called eggs benedict with turkey ham which was on a piece of dry bread and was tasteless. Lunch was also one choice a chicken salad on a tiny salad plate with out bread cracker or chip desert was one piece of rolled candy. There was no TV on the leg of the flight to Seattle to Anchorage they provided a small hand held screen with a choice of 4-5 movies and short clips. I have never had such cheap and thoughtless meals on any of my previous flights. I would never recommend this Airline but if your required to fly it don't waste your money on first class.,3alaska-airlines,16/06/13,SEA-MFR via PDX then PDX-SEA. All flights on time. Service great. No complaints except maybe the skimpy selection of beverages but these are such short flights.,9alaska-airlines,13/06/13,Flew from Honolulu to Newark return in First. Flew Alaska last year in first and was so impressed booked with them again. Great service and the meals are just some of the best I have had on a plane. Flights were on time except for a delay because of weather but that's flying for you. Cant blame the airline for that. The staff are helpful and polite. Love the small first class of only 16 seats. Makes it feel like being on a small business jet as very individual service. Again well done to Alaska and would fly with them again.,10alaska-airlines,02/06/13,"SJC-OGG SJC-LIH SAN-BOS return in F on relatively new 737-800 aircraft. While Alaska planes may not have the ""bells and whistles"" of JetBlue or Virgin America Alaska succeeds by running a very reliable operation offering a decent inflight product and friendly service. From Bay Area to Hawaii I was able to upgrade to First via online check-in for $100. Worth every penny! Check-in was fast and no charge for 2 bags. On board pre-flight beverages offered and menus were distributed. Mid-range wine choices but glasses were kept refilled throughout. The Alaskan Amber beer is quite good too. Breakfast served in 2 courses and Lunch/Dinner in 3 courses and the pace of service was quite relaxed. A snack later in the flight. Food and portions were very good on all flights. Crew were very polite and addressed passengers by last name. One FA even personally thanked each passenger for their business at the end. IFE consisted of a ""digeplayer"" providing a wide choice. The touchscreen worked well and the picture was clear although the sound quality will be much better if you bring your own headphones. F seats are basic domestic F but the extra width and legroom certainly make the upgrade worthwhile. Best part is their excellent on-time performance. I've only encountered 2 delays in the past 30+ flights.",10alaska-airlines,02/06/13,We have been trying for two days to get to Fairbanks and have spent 15 hours in airports and not there yet. There has been delay after delay and none of them weather related. The delays and cancellations have all been maintenance and crew problems which seem to be a systemic problem with Alaska Airlines starting with their top management. This is Sunday and I tried to talk to a supervisor in the Anchorage Airport and was told that supervisors aren't available on Sunday.,alaska-airlines,27/05/13,Victoria - Seattle - Maui return in First Class. The service was impeccable and breakfast on the outbound flight was very good and spread out over a couple of hours which helped pass the time. Lunch on the inbound flight was equally good with a choice of sirloin steak or sweet and sour chicken. Frequent offers of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages throughout the flights. Individual entertainment tablets with a wide range of films and TV shows. Attendants were very friendly and attentive. All the flights departed on time and arrived on time. This is the first time travelling on Alaska First Class and it was well worth the additional cost. My only disappointment was The Boardroom at Sea-Tac. It was pretty drab with a poor choice of food/snacks (both in the morning and early evening). It is certainly not worth $45 a visit. It is not a patch on Air Canada's Maple Leaf lounges.,9alaska-airlines,26/05/13,LAX to DCA on May 23rd. Apart from one every other flight attendant was rude and scowled the whole trip. No greeting as we boarded the plane no follow through with promises to help provide first aid (or a simple bandaid after an injury) and no explanation for delays that occurred. The attendants seemed annoyed when customers asked for beverages when we were seemingly skipped. Overall this flight is miserable and the staff are far less pleasant than the attendants who work for foreign or even domestic airlines that I have flown with recently. Granted the lack of amenities on this older flight doesn't add much to the comfort of fl going across country but a pleasant attitude for the staff wouldn't hurt.,5alaska-airlines,10/05/13,My flight from Honolulu to San Jose was delayed 2.5 hours today which made me miss my connecting flight to Atlanta. They then told me there were no flight tonight to the east coast yet while I was sitting with an employee waiting for new boarding passes for tomorrow a flight to New York was boarding right next to me. Not a full flight either! They changed my flight but then brought me outside to wait for a shuttle to a hotel. I was left on the curb with 5 suitcases and a duffel bag and waited an hour. I finally called the hotel and they told me the shuttle had stopped running at midnight. I ended up having to take a taxi to the hotel. The next day when I was boarding my new flight I had to pay to check my bags again. All in all I paid 60$ extra for re checking my bags a 15 dollar cab and absolutely no sleep. They had absolutely horrible customer service and late flights.,alaska-airlines,25/04/13,After a very unsatisfying flight on Delta from ATL to SEA it was a privilege to board our Alaska Airlines flight to ANC. Not only the extra legroom and comfort of the aircraft but the excellent cabin crew made me forget the horrible service Delta had just delivered.,10alaska-airlines,23/04/13,"Round trip SAN/PVR April 4-12. Alaska's first is more of a ""light first"". Seats and legroom just so so. Same pasta dish on both legs served along side a small salad. No roll butter or dessert. Flight attendants on both legs were great they seemed embarrassed about the meal quality but kept drinks flowing and were very pleasant. Both flights on time. Travelled on BA award tickets.",5alaska-airlines,22/04/13,ANC to RNO with stop in SEA. I must admit that I was pleased with Alaska and Horizon Air in both directions. I flew their 737/8 on the way down and the 900 model on return. Planes were clean service was much better than I have had in the past. If they keep it up I may end up with them again soon. Good job and a decent price for what I received.,8alaska-airlines,21/04/13,I flew from SEA to PHX the flight was great the ground staff and inflight staff very accommodating. They give out free snacks and a choice to purchase a inflight meal/snack. I will be flying Alaska Airlines again.,10alaska-airlines,16/04/13,We travelled overnight from Seattle to Orlando and were seated in the very back row of the plane. These seats are hard up against the back wall of the plane and do not recline. It was a most uncomfortable trip I can remember and would definitely recommend avoiding travelling with Alaskan Air.,alaska-airlines,02/04/13,I flew to Las Vegas March 29th and returned April 1. First class round-trip $777. Service down was slow and we were served a cheese platter. Not a significant midday meal but it was sufficient. Returning was worse. Nearly an hour before cocktails were delivered. We were not served the cheese platter. We were served hot pasta in cheese sauce on a sad looking salad bed. I asked the Flight Attendant for the cheese platter instead as I heard them offering it to the coach passengers. She advised that I would have to pay for it. She was rude and smug. Apparently I can drink you dry of scotch but have to pay additional for a decent meal. In addition after being served our drinks another Flight Attendant came up to us and asked if we wanted our pretzel bags as they did not have enough to serve coach. I have been flying Alaska Airlines since 1973. This is the worst service I have received coach or first class. Flying 1st class is more than a wider seat. It represents a gracious and superior attention to the passengers for which a premium is being paid.,5alaska-airlines,01/04/13,Shuttle flight from Seattle to Portland and we missed the original connection as our international flight was late. AS couldn't have done more to help us and got us on the standby list on loaded and even sat together. Quick flight friendly crew and always my first choice for us domestic flights.,9alaska-airlines,26/03/13,Flew from Anchorage to Seattle with a seat on a plane from Seattle to Vegas. The weather was bad in Anchorage but the pilot assured us we'd make our connections. Got to the gate in Vegas 21 minutes before the flight was set to leave. The Las Vegas crew was alerted that 45 of us from the Anchorage plane were bound for Vegas. The gate agent would not let us on the plane. Smiled smugly and said sorry. We all went to the customer service centre where a man told us we were lucky to get seats on the 9.35 flight. While I was at customer service I noticed the Vegas plane was still at the gate - 20 minutes later. I paid almost $1800 for this experience. Clearly Alaska Airlines isn't interested in customer service.,alaska-airlines,26/03/13,DCA-LAX on a 737-800. Plane pushed back from the gate 15 minutes before scheduled departure time and was in the air right on time (I can't remember the last time this has happened). Aircraft was very clean and the leather seats were very comfortable. The crew did 3 drink runs and we received plenty of updates from the flight deck which I always appreciate. Will definitely consider flying them again since they have a codeshare agreement with American Airlines.,10alaska-airlines,22/03/13,Seattle to Maui return. Planes departed on time and arrived slightly early both ways. Baggage was already waiting for us when we arrived in claim area. Attendants were very courteous and pleasant. Food purchased was just fine-deli pack. I usually travel Alaska if possible and have not had anything to complain about. They have always departed on time and done a good job!,9alaska-airlines,22/03/13,"SFO-SJD return. The flight to Los Cabos left and arrived on time the return flight left half an hour early but was required to circle SFO for almost as long before landing. Snacks on the 2hr 40min flights were edible nothing more. FAs were attentive. Seats were comfortable but legroom was as tight as any I've experienced in a first class (or business class) cabin. Alaska now departs from the new SJD terminal it lacks some of the features - dining options in particular - that made the ""old"" one a pleasant place to await boarding.",8alaska-airlines,15/03/13,First class KOA-PDX. Flight was on time. Seats fine. Food fine. In-flight entertainment (individual hand- held devices) fine. Nothing spectacular but we had no complaints. We chose Alaska over Hawaiian because it was fully refundable in first class and also non-stop from Kona to Portland where as Hawaiian was not unless you purchased a much more expensive ticket.,8alaska-airlines,13/03/13,Staff indifferent and rude. We had a 4 hour delay from Kona to Portland and they offered no inflight freebies to compensate. Going to Maui they kept serving alcohol to passengers that were drunk.,1alaska-airlines,07/03/13,Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.,2alaska-airlines,21/02/13,I recently flew round-trip from Boston to Seattle on Alaska Airlines. I was happy that we: 1) arrived safely 2) arrived on-time. I didn't check a bag so cannot rate their handling of my luggage. I was surprised to learn that even on longer haul flights in-flight entertainment was not complimentary as it is on other airlines. In addition the food offerings had no hot meal suitable for a vegetarian at any meal. My seat on the flight to SEA was very uncomfortable but adequate on the return flight. Alaska Airlines got the major points right but there's plenty of room for improvement!,6alaska-airlines,20/02/13,LAX-SJD-LAX Feb 15 First Class. What a disappointing experience. We purchased (not upgraded or miles) first class tickets to Cabo expecting a lot more. The first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3. Very cramped! Forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all. It also appears that the 3rd (and last row of 1st) has minimal seat recline. The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays. I'd say this product is an embarrassment to this airline.,3alaska-airlines,19/02/13,Flight was late on both legs of round trip. The food advertised was not available and what was available they ran out of so we could not feed our 3 yrs old. When my husband complained the flight attendant happened to find something. There should be enough food for the passengers especially when you're landing at 10.30pm.,alaska-airlines,16/01/13,The day we were to depart was a bad weather day for the North Eastern part of the country and the aircraft we were to take from Reagan International was delayed due to weather. When we arrived at the airport shortly before the flight I received a call regarding this delay. When we finally go to the ticket counter the agent informed us that we would more than likely miss our connecting flight and they wanted us to depart from Dulles. After speaking to the customer service agent we were informed of the situation and they would pay for a taxi to get to Dulles send our bags and upgrade us on the United flight to first class. We got to Dulles with time to spare boarded our flight and got to California early enough to get a good nights rest before catching our connection. End result we arrived to our destination refreshed on time and ready. Our luggage arrived with us as well.,10alaska-airlines,10/01/13,DCA-SEA Dec 24 Y class. Orderly bordering and flight left on time (it helped that DCA was practically empty at 5pm on Christmas eve). Seats clean and definitely provided more legroom than my United flight a few weeks later. Service efficient but nothing extraordinary. Solid and consistent performance.,8alaska-airlines,08/01/13,Just flew from Vancouver to San Diego via LAX with Alaska. 2nd segment was with a Delta Regional operating for Alaska. My bag which was checked through did not arrive. Airport rep said it was the 3rd day in a row this had happened on the Vancouver flight. When I called Alaska to find out why this known problem was not addressed and why I was the third day victim the rep kept trying to tell me it was Delta's fault and then hung up on me.,alaska-airlines,08/01/13,BLI to HNL on 26 December 2012. Alaska's in-flight staff were excellent on this flight. Three beverage services and free mai tai's before landing. The rented Digiplayer was delivered promptly after take-off. Staff were all very cheerful and did their best to make our flight enjoyable. Excellent work.,8alaska-airlines,03/01/13,Excellent flight on new 739-900ER yesterday (AS 109) from SEA to ANC. Excellent crew and great service all in light on a very bumpy flight due to strong winds along the route. Last few flights on AS have really been good with on time departures and arrivals.,10alaska-airlines,21/12/12,I have been sitting in Calgary airport for 4 hours with little communication from the staff as to what is going on. First they have us board the plane and the plane is not even functioning. Then they have us sit on the plane for over an hour before telling us what is going on. Then finally they instruct everyone to get off the plane and wait. And wait. And still waiting. Finally an hour later they board us again saying everything is repaired and we are ready to go. Oh but wait we are still sitting here waiting with no communication from the flight team. I will never fly them again.,alaska-airlines,20/12/12,I flew from DFW to Seattle then on to Honolulu. Interior of the planes are shabby and worn. Seats are hard and narrow with minimum recline. No pillows blankets or footrests. FA tossed a bag of mixed nuts toward my hubby by the window seat couldn't she have handed it to him?,3alaska-airlines,17/12/12,I started flying another airline about 2 years ago but today decided to give Alaska another chance. I was sorely disappointed. The ticketing agents greeted me with frowns and a cold mechanical demeanour. The woman managing the line was condescending and seemed irritated with everyone. When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity. Alaska built a reputation with exceptional customer service and a clean well maintained fleet of aircraft. Today booth there workforce and equipment seems to be in need of a serious overhaul.,2alaska-airlines,05/12/12,I fly Alaska a lot - MVP Gold for several consecutive years. I maintain this status mainly through partner airline miles. The main reason I stick with Alaska is that they have direct flights to two of my primary destinations from SEA where other airlines have stops in between. Service on Alaska is wildly variable. One flight will be the best service I can remember and the very next flight will be painful and unpleasant. So - if you are lucky and get a newer aircraft and a good crew you are good to go. If on the other hand you get one of the worn-out planes and/or a crew that couldn't care less if you were there or not.,7alaska-airlines,26/11/12,Flew from SFO to Seattle Seattle to LA and then Seattle to SFO. Check in and boarding was seamless - for each flight we departed either on time or ahead of the scheduled departure time and luggage was always ready to be picked up within 20 mins of exiting the aircraft. Flight crew are friendly. Will fly with them again.,7alaska-airlines,30/10/12,SFO to Seattle. Printed my boarding pass and was waiting to board my late night flight back to Seattle which was delayed by 3 hours. When I checked my options for changing the flight I was told its a non refundable ticket and to change was $100. Staff do not appear trained to be polite and offer service. We waited for passengers from a connecting flight to arrive this consumed another 30 minutes.,alaska-airlines,08/10/12,I choose Alaska over United on my flights from LAX to PDX or SEA because they fly 737 and not commuters and offer a better Coach product than United. Crew seems happy to be there and they have hot food to purchase with good coffee! Having Wifi is a plus as well.,10alaska-airlines,30/09/12,SEA-ANC return in First. On the way up Anchorage was expecting bad weather. The FAs who had already delayed providing any first class service until about 50 minutes into the flight decided more than an hour out of ANC to prepare the cabin for landing. They got on the overhead and informed everyone that the captain had ordered this then promptly ceased service closed the restrooms and plopped down in their jump seats to chat. (This was clearly visible from First.) About a half hour of smooth flying later the pilot got on the intercom and announced that the FAs should begin preparing the cabin for arrival. It was obvious he had no idea the FAs had ceased working 30 minutes earlier. Alaska really needs to do something about its FAs. They used to be the best in the business such that it was a real treat to get to fly Alaska on this leg; now this route in particular is staffed by burnouts. I get better treatment on Delta for my Alaska frequent flyer status than I do on Alaska.,1alaska-airlines,28/09/12,Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card. On the full flight back from Anchorage to Seattle on 17 September I don't know that I have ever been packed tighter in an aircraft. I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg. I know the economy is tough and the airline business intent upon wringing the last buck they can from the consumer but Alaska Airlines has taken this to a new level. I felt for the flight attendants hawking meals video devices and other such up and down the aisle. In Seattle prior to the last leg to Kansas City they gave us a start by posting a 7 hour delay- with no explanation whatever. Fortunately after 20 minutes of angst the original departure time was reinstated. I last traveled to Alaska on Alaska Airlines quite a few years ago and the present experience in coach was like night and day.,4alaska-airlines,26/09/12,Flew Newark to Honolulu via Seattle and Bellingham First Class. First time with Alaska. Very impressive. Seats comfortable food was great. The flight from Bellingham to Honolulu had the best airline food I have had. The crew were friendly on all legs. One thing that did annoy was that even though an announcement was made at the start of each flight that the front toilet was for first class only during the flight Economy passengers would use it and not be stopped. The digeplayer was not up to the standard of in seat units and did not have a good selection. But overall excellent flights. Would fly with them again.,9alaska-airlines,18/09/12,Alaska Airlines is slightly better than other major U.S. carriers. Like the legacy carriers they have also done away with blankets entertainment and free coach food. Fortunately flight attendants were actually kind and I did find the seats to be noticeably more comfortable. Having a friendly smiling crew and a nice seat made quite a difference.,6alaska-airlines,17/09/12,"Heading to Disneyland for our daughter's sixth birthday. Planned well in advance and when it comes to checking in they have separated the three of us with their updated seat assignment. We all have the same last name an it clearly states that we're travelling with a child. Get to the gate only to be told by the agent that she can't do anything and we should ask the flight attendants to find us seats together. We get in the plane and explain the situation to the flight attendants and they now tell us that hey can't do anything and we're out of luck. ""Maybe someone will be nice enough to switch seats with you"". Is this really how you handle mistakes? By passing the buck and doing nothing? A complete disappointment from a company that has obviously forgotten what customer service means.",1alaska-airlines,03/09/12,I booked a one way trip from Seattle to Los Angeles and after reading some of the negative comments I was a little concerned. It turned out my worries were unfounded. I booked my trip online some time before the trip and got a very reasonable price. I was able to select seats on reservation and was able to change them when checking in online. On arrival at Seatac check in was smooth and swift and the boarding process was well organised. Staff on board were pleasant and informative and I found the on board wi-fi excellent - and cheaper than what some hotels charge! All in all a very pleasant flight and would certainly use Alaska again without any hesitation.,9alaska-airlines,30/08/12,One way from San Diego to Seattle in first class. I paid approximately $450 for the seat. The extent of the food service on the 2.5 hour flight was a fruit and cheese plate. Pitiful to describe and worse to eat. There was also absolutely no in-flight entertainment no headsets and no video.,2alaska-airlines,29/08/12,We were very disappointed during our 4 weeks trip around Alaska and way to Hawaii with Alaska Airlines. We used it for many flights. SEA-JUN JUN-CVA CVA-ANC Fairbanks-Barrow Anchorage-HNL and HNL-SEA and always the same opinion. Old dated planes service near zero (no free meals) just peanuts and drinks. You have to pay for your luggage when you don't travel only around Alaska: for us a total of 80 USD. More over no entertainment you have to pay 10$ to watch old movies. To conclude crew not very friendly.,2alaska-airlines,07/08/12,I already checked into my flight and got my boarding pass at the airport. However with Alaska you have to wait in line to pay for your luggage separately (is this something new?). By the time it was my turn to pay for my luggage they said my luggage was too late for the flight. The luggage needs to be paid and checked in 40 min before the flight. As a result they took my boarding pass away and switch me to a flight 8 hrs later. Because of the huge delay my business activities all have to be sacrificed.,1alaska-airlines,07/08/12,I showed up 2 hours early but a TSA-Alaska problem made me miss my flight. Their small print symbol calling for additional security screening was missed by TSA so when I went to board they had to send me back to TSA and I missed my flight. The worst part is that they wouldn't put me on the next flight to my destination (on another airline) and made me wait 5+ hours for another Alaska flight. I would have been better off driving. I'll avoid flying with Alaska air in the future if I can.,1alaska-airlines,16/07/12,My husband and I were refused to fly because he had an airline approved oxygenator to take on as hand luggage and it would not be used in flight. We had purchased First class tickets to from Seattle to Hawaii they put us on another Airline those seats were economy and the cost of those tickets were $360.00 pp and we had paid over $700 pp - they gave us a refund of $105 pp.,1alaska-airlines,09/07/12,LAX-PDX-BLI and BLI-SEA-SFO. All flights were completely full. Comfort on all aircraft's was surprisingly good. What lets them down is the staff. Robotic flight attendants going through the motions. Check-in staff in Bellingham were agonizingly slow. There were only two customers in front of me. 20 mins later there were still two customers in front of me. When I finally reached the counter my bag was 50.7 pounds. I am told to re-pack it. I took one shoe out of my suitcase and put it in my carry-on and she accepted my suitcase. On both Horizon Air flights (PDX-BLI-SEA) flight attendants sat in their jumpseats and read magazines the entire flight. My Alaska Seattle-San Francisco flight ended up arriving over an hour late. I had to run through SFO to catch my Air New Zealand flight. What a pleasure to be greeted at the door of Air NZ by smiling polite cabin crew.,2alaska-airlines,08/07/12,Found planes to be aged and shabby. Tray tables dirty would not want to eat off them. Staff seemed friendly but their uniforms were unimpressive. Had a delay out of Seattle and everyone was made to get off plane travel by train to another terminal to board another plane because of a broken seat. This was obviously known about before we boarded so they should not have put that plane back into service before it was fixed. Would not recommend this airline.,4alaska-airlines,05/07/12,Previously I have had mostly positive experiences with Alaska Airlines. However over an hour after boarding the plane we are still sitting at the gate waiting for maintenance and my 16 month old is getting fussy. I ask the FA if she can get us some juice to calm him down and am told no even though she is serving coffee to other passengers. 30 minutes later we are still sitting there and he is seeing everyone else getting drinks but him and starts to cry at which point the FA comes back and tells me to make him be quiet. I fly with my son almost twice a month and have never had a problem. On any other airline they would have tried to help the situation by talking to him or bringing a snack or a pair of wings. But not this one.,2alaska-airlines,05/07/12,Being based in Portland I am stuck traveling Alaska 75% of the time for business travel and was never impressed with the quality of the planes or service. Recently I used rewards miles for a trip to Honolulu. The plane was a standard 737 with absolutely no amenities. The overhead air barely blew. Service was terrible. Based on the most recent experience with their customer service I will try even harder to not fly Alaska and I am cancelling their rewards credit card. The other 25% I travel United and have never had a problem with their planes or service.,1alaska-airlines,02/07/12,I flew in from round trips OAK to HNL both flights were awful. The money I paid for these two flight's were great and that's the main reason I'm not too hateful towards them. The food was not bad. The staff service was good. The main reason my experience with Alaska Airlines was awful is because the actual aircraft's I flew in were horrible! The seats were incredibly small I was feeling very cramped during the whole flight's it was impossible to sleep on those plane's because the recliner's barely reclined. The leg room was ridiculous it's really hard to get up and go to the lavatory. The lavatory is also a bit small. There was not any complimentary in-flight entertainment expect the crew members offered screens to watch movies shows etc with a 10$ fee. Overall Alaska Airlines is mediocre. If you want a good price to go to Hawaii but understand that you will suffer cramped seats for 5 and half hours fly Alaska Airlines.,5alaska-airlines,01/07/12,Flew SFO to SEA. My 9.20am flight was over sold. I was bumped to another flight leaving from OAK 5 hours later. My return flight left 5 hours late after changing planes twice because of mechanical problems. Worst flight experience I have had on many years and I fly 50000 plus miles a year. I haven't flown Alaska in 20 years and I never will again.,1alaska-airlines,12/06/12,I would not recommend Frontier for those with connections. My flight from BNA-SFO with a connection in Denver was grounded because of plane problems. We were grounded in St Louis and agents were most unhelpful. I was stuck in St Louis and only got to my destination because I booked other flights in order to do so. Frontier does not do anything but give a 200 voucher for a missed connection. On my way back from SFO to BNA (connecting through Denver) we were grounded for a medical emergency which is understandable however no help given to those who missed connections. I got home on my own doing by booking a Southwest flight while we were grounded in Grand Junction. They have limiting options to help you out if you miss a connection.,1alaska-airlines,11/06/12,MCI-SEA-ANC- May 2012. All flights on time no delays. Had an excellent Tuscan pasta dish. Return was also without hitch long layover in SEA but got passes to the Boardroom and enjoyed to space and quiet. All of our flights on Alaska have been positive and enjoyable.,9alaska-airlines,05/06/12,I was flying from DCA to SAN with a connection in Denver. DCA to DEN was a nice enough flight with no complaints. However when my flight from DEN to SAN came they were unable to get a pilot. Keep in mind that DEN is Frontier's hub. This occurred at 10.10 pm and by the time I was able to speak with customer service the earliest flight that I could get to SAN was 9 pm the next day. Fortunately I did not have plans the next day but I know several people in the line who had to miss out on their plans due to this.,3alaska-airlines,04/06/12,Overall my flight was very pleasant. The crew were nice and friendly and for the most part the plane was clean. They forgot the digeplayers however and the wifi was iffy so definitely bring a ipad along with you with non-wifi apps. The headrests are annoying for shorter passenger as they are literally a pain in the neck. Overall Alaska Airlines was a cheap alternative to other airlines to Seattle.,8alaska-airlines,31/05/12,"I bought tickets to fly myself and my 2 young kids (ages 4 and 2) from Salt Lake to Kansas City 2 months in advance. Inexplicably Frontier did not assign us seats together. For each of the 4 legs on this round-trip gate agents did a little shuffling to get us in the same row. But I still had to personally ask other people already on their seats to move. Travelling alone this wouldn't have been a big deal but with two little kids? Just getting on the plane and taking care of everyone's food potty and entertainment needs is stressful enough. Frontier made this such an unpleasant experience that I will avoid getting any tickets on Frontier again. When I said something about this to a flight attendant I got the response ""Well that's Frontier for you!""",2alaska-airlines,21/05/12,LAX-SEA-LAX-GDL in First Class. Alaska served the same meal consisting of a Chicken Sandwich and orzo pasta salad on all sectors. I was especially disappointed on the International sector of LAX-GDL. Alaska Airlines was on time for all sectors baggage was delivered promptly and the inflight cabin staff were efficient. They have to learn to vary their menu for First Class Passengers especially on International Sectors. Thus the mediocre rating.,5alaska-airlines,09/05/12,PDX-LGB return. While the flight was technically on SkyWest it is abundantly clear that this is an Alaska Air operation from the plane livery to the standard level of service given - which is to say a cut above. Clean CRJ planes 2x beverage service - no charge for microbrew beer or Pacific Northwest wines arrived on time with not much fuss. Only quibbles were the standard narrow CRJ seating and any food other than a package of pretzels had to be purchased. I liked the fact that the counter person suggested I check my bag plane- side avoiding the ridiculous $20 surcharge on all counter-checked luggage.,8alaska-airlines,03/05/12,OGG-SEA-BOS First Class. Flying in first class and not having to worry about paying $18 for the video player plus 2 suitcases each was almost worth it. We boarded on time and were given a plastic cup of water. The flight attendant took our coats and was polite and attentive. He let us know our food choices and was very attentive throughout the flight. We arrived early into SEA and had a 3 hour layover we went to the first class lounge in another terminal but had time to kill. Free food relaxing and comfortable lounge was appreciated. We boarded on time for BOS and again were given great service and lots of attention. I was pleased with my time in first class and just booked again for our return next Feb.,9alaska-airlines,24/04/12,ATL-SEA in First Class. Lamb dinner was very good. Service excellent. New version of Digiplayer entertainment system is a big improvement. Left on time arrived a little early. Seat comfortable. Couldn't ask for much more.,10alaska-airlines,24/04/12,I am a 75K elite status on this Airline and fly every weekend and also 1 million miler status since two years ago but sadly have seen a dramatic decline in service. First class not worth the cost. Upgrades even with my status are rare. Food is horrible. I recommend you stick with either American or Delta or United or Southwest for elite status. MVP Gold and 75K means nothing to the airline.,2alaska-airlines,24/04/12,I have been an Alaska Airlines MVP Gold passenger for 6 years. Each year the service and attitude slips in the past 2 years more than ever in crew attitude food portions and quality. The routes I fly for business are SEA-ANC SEA-DCA and SEA-LAZ. Last two round trips one to DCA and to LAX were especially bad. The plane had not been well serviced the food was not up to standard and FA's did not care about the over heated cabin. The sorry truth is that on the SEA-ANC and SEA-WDC flights Alaska knows that they can be poor and still outshine their competitors.,2alaska-airlines,11/04/12,We flew from Bellingham to Honolulu HI and back with Alaska Airlines. On the flight to HI we sat in row 23. By the time the food service got to us (I was willing to pay for food) they were out of the good food and only had things that no one else wanted to buy. Lousy service lousy prices. Late leaving HI for Bellingham by 30 minutes. This airline continues to go down hill. Years ago it was a great airline. Not so much anymore.,3alaska-airlines,15/03/12,Cost-cutting measures are showing more and more. Although first class is quite expensive it really isn't worth the extra expense anymore except for the larger seats and increased legroom. Meal service is a shadow of what it used to be just a few years ago. A recent flight from Anchorage to Seattle features a chicken curry salad that was frightful while the nice desserts have shrunk to a small piece of candy. Not impressed.,6alaska-airlines,12/03/12,Terrible Airline cheap with bad service. My plane landed in Seattle for a connecting flight at 10.40pm my connecting flight left at 11.00pm. Though the flight staff announced that all those people who needed to get on connecting flights be let off the plane first none of the passengers complied when we landed. Flight staff did nothing to ensure that folks who needed to get connecting flights got to them on time. I ended up at my gate at 10.55pm though flight staff closed the gate anyway no apology no help.,2alaska-airlines,29/02/12,We flew to Mexico in coach. Both ways they ran out of food and we were at the front of the plane row 8. Trying to get one of the attendants to serve you for a drink is a nightmare. We have flown many times and each time it goes down hill further. Our next flight is in First Class so lets see if it is any better. After reading the reviews I am not holding my breath.,2alaska-airlines,23/02/12,First Class is an expensive joke. An ageing fleet makes for poor seats and amenities. Food is poor - both legs of our first class trip brought the reality that only some in first class are allowed to order from the menu. For both legs we were given food that was unwanted and in fact inedible.,1alaska-airlines,09/01/12,YEG-SEA-LAX both flights were considerably disappointing. Food - all I had was a small snack. Drinks were good. Flight Attendants were hit and miss in responding to requests. There was no inflight entertainment. Seats weren't very comfortable with little to no space.,4alaska-airlines,26/10/11,I filled out everything from seat number to meal preference it turned out to be a waste of time. There is no food other than pricey snacks and the seats assigned at check-in. I was taken back by the lack of free onboard movies instead you have to purchase that too. As well as being turned away from using lavatory in front of airplane - that's reserved for higher paying customers. So not having been on Alaska in sometime I was very disappointed.,3alaska-airlines,24/10/11,YVR-LAX-YVR. Both flights relatively full and on-time. Great service FAs and surprisingly comfortable seats (though narrow). The only negative thing to point out is their terminal in LAX which is not good at all - overcrowded and dirty.,8alaska-airlines,21/10/11,ANC-SFO-PSP-ANC First Class. Flight attendants do not serve first class like first class. It's more like you're time warped back into what Coach used to be like. Drinks on offer before takeoff - tepid water poured out of an open common bottle into a plastic cup. Service after takeoff indifferent. Food not great. Interestingly if you request an alcoholic drink they bring you two mini-bottles of the alcohol but don't bring you the can of tonic/soda/whatever that goes with it so you can mix it yourself. Planes are exceedingly loud with announcements from FAs but if the pilot speaks you can't hear a word. Between that and the thin rocky seats make sure you pack your ibuprofen.,2alaska-airlines,21/10/11,My family and I were scheduled to traveled from DC to Seattle this week but we accidentally went to the wrong airport. Our mistake completely however you would have never guessed that considering the way the ground crew treated us. They immediately got us rescheduled on another flight to LA and on again to Seattle. They made sure we had our seats together as much as possible and were as hospitable as could possibly be. I've always felt that our prior experiences on Alaska Air were always good but I was truly impressed with their service on this last trip. I am certain that we would not have had such luck on any other airline. I want to thank Alaska Air for making a possible bad situation a positive and comfortable day for us.,10alaska-airlines,20/10/11,I've had to fly Alaska almost every Monday morning and Thursday evening for the past 2.5 months from Seattle to Oakland because of a project I was on. Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).,8alaska-airlines,14/10/11,I flew 6 hrs from Seattle to Kona on a full flight. The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements. Please let us have some peace and quiet! We noticed the contrast with Hawaiian Airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley.,5alaska-airlines,10/10/11,SEA-MIA. I had the misfortune of missing my flight the night before (my fault). I ended up flying out the next morning on my birthday my travel partner mentioned to the FAs that it was my birthday. They went out of their way and made me feel quite special. The FA asked me if I liked sweet or sour and soon came back with a special drink which he'd put dry ice in to make it bubbly! Then later they lent me a complimentary movie player. They were small gestures but really made my day. The service was great.,9alaska-airlines,03/10/11,On return flight from Maui we sat in the first row behind 1st class. My wife needed to use the restroom and must use a crutch to walk so she went forward to 1st class. I went to the back but was blocked by 10 people in line who were blocked by the serving cart so I returned to the front. My wife had returned to her seat and another lady was going through the door so I waited. Then a lady attendant seeing me waiting told me I must go to the rear. I explained that the aisle was blocked by the serving cart she insisted I go back which I did. After the long wait on the serving cart I finally reached the restroom. When I returned to my seat the man in the aisle next to me asked why I went back. He said while I was gone 3 people had passed him and used the front bath room without any harassment. I realized that this restroom is intended for First Class but at the same time a little reasonable attitude and common sense by the attendant would be appreciated.,5alaska-airlines,10/09/11,San Diego to Seattle return. The overall trip was excellent. The crew were nice and gave me a free extra snack. My carry-on was 2 inches larger than the maximum but the gate agent offered to consider it check-in luggage for no extra cost. Only negative point is that both landings were hard especially at San Diego.,9alaska-airlines,22/08/11,Burbank CA to Seattle WA. My mother is quite elderly staff were very courteous from the moment she exited the car. She was supplied with a wheelchair with and pushed by a staff member to both the ticket counter and security without waiting and then helped onto the plane. The trip went without a hitch.,10alaska-airlines,22/08/11,Flew nonstop Oakland to Kona. Its a much smaller plane than Hawaiian or United for example but seat size is the same. However there are no movies and music they will rent you small hand held pads. They only use one food cart in coach so if you are at the back you will wait over 1 hr after service starts. Food is reasonably priced. Staff are nice and helpful if you know what to expect its fine.,5alaska-airlines,18/08/11,The airline did got us to the destination however they re-assigned our seats upon check-in - to the lavatory row. I paid full fair for these tickets and spent 6.5 hrs with people standing next to us. When I asked to have my family back in their original seats I was told there was an equipment change. Apparently the computer runs the airline. The computer reassigned the seats and there is nothing a human can do to rectify the situation.,1alaska-airlines,17/08/11,Bellingham to Las Vegas return. The flight was great and they provided us a free snack and drinks. Seats were comfortable crew are very friendly. Both flights were on-time. The only negative is that don't have enough check- in counters and staff at Bellingham it was a mess lining up.,8alaska-airlines,15/08/11,MFR-PDX-LAS. Adequate flight to Portland with Horizon. Limited service and bumpy ride in crowded Bombardier. Great flight with Alaska in First after chaotic boarding at Portland. Pleasant cabin and comfy seat. Inflight service good drinks flowed freely though the meal wasn't to my taste.,10alaska-airlines,11/08/11,Puerto Vallarta from Los Angeles. Its only a 3 hr flight. We paid full price First Class not upgrades. First Class it was not. Besides the 737-400 being old and tired my seat was broken both ways. Seat pitch is the tightest I've ever experienced it was impossible to get up with the seat in front reclined. Food was awful there were zero amenities and pre-flight beverage service was water. I had to wait behind coach passengers to use the lavatory both ways despite the announcements alerting passengers about the usage of the front lavatory. The one bright spot was the use of their Board Room Lounge at LAX. Its very nice wonderful staff and plenty of amenities. Alaska needs to upgrade their First Class or go ahead and rip out the four abreast seats up front.,2alaska-airlines,07/08/11,"BLI-HNL on 737-800. ALOHA card on seat with ""Here's the Flight Plan"" on one side and ""Island Trivia"" on the other side sets the Hawaiian mood. Complimentary macadamia nuts and mai tai near arrival leaves a good impression. FA's efficient served free juices and cookie. Does not compare with international flights on Asian carriers but about as good as can be expected nowadays on a domestic flight.",8alaska-airlines,30/07/11,San Jose to Spokane Washington. Flight out of San Jose was delayed the agent assured me I would make my connecting flight. We landed and my connecting flight was on time I ran across the airport only to be told the plane had left already. There no apology for the delay or missed flight staff were surly at the gate. Instead of responding to my concerns with some empathy and trying to make a positive difference they went out of their way to make it worse. I've never had this kind of experience with Alaska in the past and I fly with them fairly regularly.,alaska-airlines,29/07/11,"SEA to LAX. We were seated in first class row 1. When we tried to stow our carry on bags the crew had their stuff in our overhead. This forced us to use the overhead behind us which held those people's bags. Plus we got dirty looks from them. The same happened our return trip. We were appalled when coach customers lined up to use the 1st class restroom - why don't the attendants stop the coach from using the 1st restroom. When we pay for first class tickets we are paying for these ""Perks"" or so we thought. It is not our job to tell coach people the rules. It is Alaska Air's job to enforce them.",4alaska-airlines,29/07/11,We flew to Maui from PDX return - flight over was great the flight back seemed to be on a different airline. The attendants were rude and had no desire to accommodate even a very simple request. Also we paid for our bags going both ways and were only supposed to pay going one way that was an extra 40 bucks. We could have just carried them on like so many others. We paid the 14 bucks for a digiplayer but the headphone quality was so bad we couldn't hear anything. We were finally watching a movie that was very old not a new release as advertised but with 15 minutes left in flight and 5 minutes of the movie they took it away. Overall the return flight was a very inattentive and miserable looking crew.,3alaska-airlines,28/07/11,San Jose to Kona First Class. The seats are not First Class standard. The food was awful and the crew were rude. Also our First Class bathroom always had a line as they opened it to coach class. Something I have never seen on any other domestic airline. There are no First Class lounges in San Jose or Kona.,alaska-airlines,26/07/11,LAX-YVR Economy. Boarding was a little chaotic and confusing as the announcements were not made clearly and sometimes hard to hear in the big departure hall at LAX. Staff seemed pretty laid back but were generally helpful. Nice to see an airline that still serves free snacks and drinks. 737-800 was in average condition with pretty basic interior decor.,8alaska-airlines,24/07/11,I booked an Alaska flight for a short trip to San Jose CA from Los Angeles. I have never had an experience like the one I did on the return trip. 10 mins into the flight the cabin told us that due to a high volume of air traffic we would likely be delayed about 15-20 mins and would have to circle over LAX while waiting for a runway to open up. We end up circling over LAX for about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a big deal either except that we didn't land at LAX we landed at Long Beach about 30 mins away by car or 1hr 30mins with LA traffic). Then sat on the tarmac at Long Beach for nearly 2 hrs this is a 1 hr and 20 min flight to begin with and was given no information whatsoever about the airline's plans for us. When certain passengers were permitted to debark they were informed that they would be unable to retrieve their baggage from under the plane and would only be allowed to take their carryon out. Most of us had figured that the airline would probably shuttle us over to LAX. Word comes over the loudspeaker that we're flying back to LAX and will be there in about 1hr. I was expecting to meet an Alaska Airlines representative to explain to us that we would all get vouchers for cabs missed flights etc. no such luck. Not only did no one make an effort no one was even around. I couldn't find anyone from the airline other than the uninformed pilot and stewardesses. In the scheme of things delays like this happen and are sometimes unavoidable. What I don't get is how an airline can turn an hour and a half into 4 hrs by failing to plan ahead.,alaska-airlines,20/07/11,SEA-YKM on Horizon (connecting to international flights in SEA) but I have been a customer for over 15 yrs. The interior of their planes is standard but their service is what puts them above other American carriers. Numerous times when flying out of YKM and connecting in Seattle to Continental Delta BA etc they have waived second bag fees. Ground staff gate staff and FA are all helpful and genuinely want to make your trip easier. On their longer domestic flights Alsaka still has the full service feel that was the norm in the early 90s. What really sets the apart is that twice now my flight to YKM has been cancelled or forced to return to Seattle due to freezing fog and both times I have been given a full refund without argument from the call centre staff. Highly recommended by a very loyal flyer.,10alaska-airlines,25/06/11,Flew first class from Seattle-Chicago this week and was shocked at the poor cabin service. Cabin crew were ambivalent and made us feel unwelcome. The lunch offering - a bowl of soup a bread roll and salad - was very meagre. A very disappointing experience.,4alaska-airlines,23/06/11,In general Alaska Air has been my number one go to airline. They have been customer service oriented for as long as I can remember. The only bad experience I had was when I had MVP Gold status. I called the then Horizon MVP line and asked to have my husband seated next to me. They refused since he was not an MVP Gold. So I called the Alaska MVP Gold number and they put him next to me no questions asked. As for booking I recently booked a vacation through Alaska and had a difficult time. It would not pull in any of my account information from either my personal or EasyBiz account so I had to enter it all manually. Also unlike when you book just a flight you cannot pick your seats in their vacation page. I found both of these items to be frustrating. I doubt I will book a vacation through their site again. I will do everything separately.,8alaska-airlines,13/06/11,I was a little surprised to read the negative reviews of Alaska. I have always flown them and almost always satisfied and comfortable. Most recently I went Juneau to Kona and back with no complaints. I have found them better than other American carriers I have flown. Also of note due to flying in bad weather in Alaska most of their planes have cutting edge navigation technology in the cockpits.,9alaska-airlines,04/06/11,"Los Angeles-Vancouver on 737-400. Attempted check-in at kiosk but unless you have a US or Canadian passport you need to check-in at the counter. Staff neither rude nor friendly just robotic. Boarding a bit chaotic as passengers push aboard to hog overhead lockers with their gigantic carry-on bags. Was greeted at the door by a flight attendant's back. I said ""hello"" but no response. Proceeded through first class and waited patiently while passengers blocked the aisle stowing their carry-ons. I was happy to wait however a flight attendant shoves her hand in my face and shouts ""wait right there!"" I wasn't even moving! Walked past the first two rows of economy and noticed that they were smashed to pieces with a sign hanging that said ""do not use"". Not a good look. Airplane was totally full and the interior was showing it's age. Drinks and food for purchase served by frowning unenthusiastic cabin crew. Flight arrived on time baggage delivery fast. In the end they get you where you're going but like most North American based carriers staff are rude and unfriendly.",3alaska-airlines,28/05/11,We paid to fly First Class from Portland to Hawaii. Seats aren't much better than coach little leg room and hard seats. Inattentive flight attendants. No welcome drink prior to take off and the cabin was served drinks before we got ours. We used the call button and were told our FA was busy preparing our breakfast. Breakfast was fine. Digiplayer didn't have much of interest to offer. FA's disappeared after breakfast and were gabbing away. We rang again for another drink after about an hour and were ignored. Rang again and were berated for abusing the call button. Will never fly Alaska first class again stick with Hawaiian.,1alaska-airlines,22/05/11,"SEA-LIH-SEA. Flight out was OK. We were allowed to sit in our assigned seats. Hard to sleep because of numerous really loud announcements about buying food joining the frequent flier club signing up for a credit card renting a video player etc. Flight back was bad. When we checked in online the day before our return flight we discovered that Alaska had changed our seats from our nice aisle seats to poor ones. When we called we were told that it was too late to do anything; we should take care of it at the airport. That we had written confirmations of our seats which we had repeatedly reconfirmed meant nothing. At the airport check-in line we were told we had to go to the gate. At the gate we were told it was too late to do anything. The gate agent was apologetic but said ""it happens all the time."" Everyone we talked to basically said ""I don't know why this happened. We are very customer oriented. I can't help you."" Flight back was notable for the sleep robbing announcements to sell the same stuff. Does an airline have to wake everyone up to find out how many are flying on miles so they can sell more credit cards? Couldn't sleep much anyway; seat didn't recline.",3alaska-airlines,15/05/11,First class Seat 4D on Seattle/Chicago run was horrible coming and going. Like sitting on a concrete bench. Not acceptable for First or Business Class. Also what's with the Board Room restrictions? I suffered a 6-hour delay at O'Hare but American (partner in the lounge) would not let me use the lounge without a Board Room card. With a delay of any length they should give complimentary day passes to premium customers. On the plus side Alaska cabin crews are the nicest in the business and food is really good.,3alaska-airlines,25/04/11,BZN-SIT-BZN. Thanks to having a friend who works for the airline we were able to fly standby over an extended Easter weekend. We got everything we should have had we been paying the regular fare - planes were on time crews were friendly enough baggage was unloaded promptly the snacks were unappetizing the cabins were clean and seating was comfortable enough. We appreciated the efforts of the gate staff in Seattle to keep us informed of seating status on a full flight to Sitka (we were the last ones on the plane). The only complaint I have is a mild one and while not the airline's fault I mention it in hopes that maybe the airline will lobby a bit harder - the waiting area at the Sitka airport past security is cramped and without restrooms or any other amenities and the only food outlet at the airport was closed for the holiday.,8alaska-airlines,04/04/11,"ANC-SEA-SFO-SEA-ANC First Class. Outbound uneventful and reasonably good service in First. Back was another story. Surly male flight attendant who was uninterested in serving in First Class. No service for the first 90 minutes of the flight. Service when it appeared was lackadaisical at best. No refills of drinks. Flight crew sat in jumpseats ignoring passengers (including me) who were trying to use restroom. Restroom appeared occupied for long period of time. Turned out the flight crew just couldn't be bothered to turn off the ""locked"" sign for about two hours of a three hour and 20 minute flight. I am looking forward to competition in the Alaska market arriving this summer.",1alaska-airlines,04/04/11,First class from Sea-tac to Maui and back. My friend did an upgrade for an additional 360$ to join me. Service was no smile food was so so the bathroom had a constant line from the back. I asked for a Mai Tai no! Everyone got a pre-mix at the end of the flight - we got about 10 nuts in a pack (same as coach) with that. I wanted a snack and was told the cheese and fruit plate was for coach only - lucky me they had extra and I purchased it for 7$. The only good things about this flight were the seat (large) and my bags were there. Be advised to bring your own pillow and blanket because Alaska won't give them to you - and my flight was freezing!,alaska-airlines,27/03/11,"Had reservations for the family to go on spring break to California from Seattle. Not any more. Because of a computer failure all their flights were cancelled during the time period that my flight was to leave. Of course none of this was announced anywhere even on their website which I checked before we left for the airport. Got to the airport and walked into the ticketing area and huge lines of people everywhere all for Alaska Airlines. After two hours in line a customer service agent came by down the line and told everyone who had tickets for this morning that ""you might as well go home"". She said that all the other airlines were full that it would be 4 to 5 days before people could be rescheduled for their destinations. She did say that ""Alaska Air would waive their normal rescheduling fee"" That was it. No other explanation. If Alaska Airlines wants to pretend they are a big airline they need to quit treating their customers like dirt. What kind of company does not have a back up to their main operating system. The news said that they were updating their system. What company would run an update during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. Now I get to spend my time trying to get refunds from hotels cars and Disney Land.",alaska-airlines,24/03/11,Going on a flight from Vancouver BC to Los Angeles on Alaskan/Delta air and found out that a checked on bag will cost about $25 each way (there are 4 of us $200 extra) but if I went to Mexico checked bag would be free. Alaska and Delta both stated that was because Mexico is an international destination but the US is not. Really? US Canada and Mexico are on the same continent but how can the airlines say that the US is not international travel from Canada or visa versa? We must depart from the international terminal we need a passport we have to go through customs we can buy duty free products.,alaska-airlines,24/03/11,SEA-LAS. One of the very few direct flights to Las Vegas from Seattle so choice is very limited. I ask for very little on a short haul flight.

I had not flown on Alaska in quite a few years. This airline is in my opinion better than the average US carrier. B737-800 was clean newish and with pleasant staff warm snack. No baggage fee! Overall I would recommend Alaska Airlines.,9american-airlines,01/08/15,Our flight from MAN to JFK was cancelled due to engine issues which resulted in us having to rebook and we ended up flying via LHR. Our rebooked flight was with British Airways which was much better as they offered individual inflight entertainment systems unlike American who are still on an old system of overhead TVs. Our flight back from JFK was delayed and when we eventually got on board the aeroplane was quite possibly the oldest plane I have been on with a cabin crew to match. After 10 minutes the pilot informed us that a member of American Airlines staff had attempted to open the cabin door when it had already been locked which resulted in the life raft falling off the plane! We had to all disembark and after an hours wait we were told our flight was cancelled and we would need to rebook. We were put on flight the next day via Dublin which resulted us being over 24 hours late home. Appalling service and we will never travel with them again.,1alaska-airlines,15/02/11,OGG-PDX-LAX and OGG-SEA return. We live on Maui and use both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines to travel. This is a new market for Alaska and we hope they continue to improve their service. These flights were okay - standard mainland business class. Food was average. Service was good and attentive. What is lacking is a seat with better pitch foot rests and pillows or blankets. Hawaiian Airlines give you a seat with about 140 degree recline leg and foot rests and pillows and blankets. Both airlines are attentive to needs but Hawaiian has the edge with unsolicited water drinks etc. Costwise Alaska charges about $300 less than Hawaiian. For the money and the additional comfort I want Hawaiian is the better deal. But keep trying Alaska.,6alaska-airlines,11/02/11,First class from Atlanta to Seattle. The service was attentive and friendly. The meal on Alaska was beautifully presented flavorful and nourishing.,10alaska-airlines,26/01/11,"Returned on Alaska Airlines from Kauai HI. We had barely left the ground and it was announced ""no fresh fruit"" - yesterday's only. Then midway through the flight we heard ""the system is out of water. There will be no more water to drink and please try not to use the toilets unless necessary - who goes into an airline bathroom unless it is necessary? I am only guessing but I think that if there was no time to get fresh fruit on board or enough water to last the flight perhaps the preventive maintenance wasn't done either. No apologies for lack of supplies and of course no coupon for future use.",3alaska-airlines,18/01/11,ANC-SEA-SFO-PDX-ANC. Most legs of this multiple leg round trip were relatively uneventful. The nickel and diming poor gate announcements surprise gate changes in SEA etc. have all become expected of Alaska Air. What is unacceptable is how unbelievably uncomfortable and filthy the cabins now are. Alaska has no excuse they're not short on cash. As for discomfort it is unacceptable to fail to pay close attention to climate control on a packed airplane. Usually you're freezing. PDX-ANC leg averaged about 84 degrees for the entire flight. Baggage claim continues to be a joke. Alaska claims to have a compensation program if your bags take more than 20 minutes to arrive. They must know nobody is going to stick around to make a claim for now-worthless Alaska Air frequent flier miles.,american-airlines,31/07/15,"We flew from Boston, MA to St. Thomas U.S.V.I. on July 14th 2015. Flight #1619 from Boston to Miami was our first leg of the trip and that went smoothly. Then we got onto flight #2421 from Miami to St. Thomas. It was delayed a half hour. We landed in St. Thomas still being able to make our ferry to Tortola. However, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes for all of our luggage to be deplaned. During this time three other planes landed, all of their luggage was sorted out and the passengers from those planes left the terminal. We found one of our pieces of luggage was still in Miami. Our flight came in at 3.30pm, originally supposed to land at 2.57pm. It is well know that ferries stop running from Charlotte Amalie at 4.30pm. American should have done everything in its power to get people on their way. At least one third of the passengers were in the same situation as us. Four others lost baggage. My son spent the next morning trying to reconnect with his luggage and were told we would have to make a trip to the ferry terminal to pick it up. Now on to our flight home, July 25th 2015, we arrive at the airport three hours before our flight. The six of us were flying from St. Thomas to Philadelphia, PA on flight 837 leaving at 3.05pm.

The entertainment is good enough and the flight crew professional and even friendly to some extent. The one downside was the food, which was not only below what one would expect for J and not very tasty either. In the transcon similar experience. The full lie flat in J is a nice touch, and even getting over the other passenger is not a problem at all.

Upon arrival at the aircraft boarding zone there was no clear designation on which flight was which. As a result many passengers boarded the wrong aircraft and had to change planes shortly before departure. The same system applied to loading luggage which of course ended up being lost. At my destination I was told to expect a call from the central luggage department but this never happened. I called and got different versions on the status of my luggage: the first agent said it would be here on the afternoon flight the second agent said it had been scheduled but they were not sure whether it had arrived or not and the third yet most unprofessional representative Linda simply hung up when I asked her if anyone could guarantee that my luggage would be sent on a specific flight. It's sad to see such substandard logistics management for Alaska Air because the in-flight service was outstanding. Undoubtedly I will be sure to avoid this airline on my next trip to Canada.,3alaska-airlines,01/12/10,SEA-PHX in first class for the holidays. The first leg left an hour late due to the lavs not working. They brought around water and orange juice while waiting the hour on board. Breakfast served was pretty tasty.

All in all Alaska air is improving their first class experience.,8alaska-airlines,27/11/10,Miami-Seattle. The inflight experience was great however it was a different story at the airport. Alaska Air is located in concourse E (or Central Terminal) at Miami Airport. The ticket counter area is small and a very inconvenient part of the airport. Unless you arrive very early for check in the line will stretch to where it will block the entrance to a food court behind the counter the exit path of Concourse E the entrance to a TSA check point and the exit of Customs located just below them. The flight departs from Concourse F and the upside to the airport is that there are only about a handful of flights departing from F that morning so TSA checkpoint a breeze. Boarding process was poor there were no pre boarding announcements and passengers just saw other's making the line to board and assumed it was time to board no matter what row they were in. The cabin crew was attentive and cheerful there was actually space in the overhead bins. The seats were comfortable however seat pitch was terrible! Alaska offers Gogo inflight internet and they rent DigEplayers which come with movies/games etc. The flight was 6 hours 24 mins - I had no idea a 737-800 had such a long range. The meals they served (or sold) onboard were fair at a reasonable price. We had the option for a hot or cold meal. Given the long length of the flight the crew did go around the cabin about 3 times for beverage service.,8alaska-airlines,18/11/10,PDX-LAS B737 a pleasurable experience. After a 4 hour wait at PDX we were very relieved to get onto the aircraft. The aircraft was a little outdated but crew more than made up for it. Very attentive and professional. Overall very efficient.,9alaska-airlines,17/11/10,LAX-BLI one way combination of Alaska and Horizon Air. This flight was better than my other experiences on Alaska/Horizon which isn't saying much. Nothing went wrong but the fare was higher than its competitor Allegiant Air and the onboard service and seating were poor. The unionised drone cabin crew couldn't care less about the customer. Horizon Air's DHC-8-400 props are noisy and uncomfortable. Allegiant Air despite their very inconvenient scheduling offers better service and better value for the money.,4american-airlines,29/07/15,"Because of a delay caused by weather we missed a connecting flight.

So I asked again, and now I have been asked for receipt, name, boarding passes, and advantage number - three of which I have provided, and the receipt is really moot at this point.

Every single customer service rep I spoke with told me I should read all their fine print online to add up the fees prior to booking. I could not cancel even within the first 5 minutes.

I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport.

Because the flight was to Florence, not Pisa and they probably didn't want us to notice. So we went back through security (1.5 hours, Heathrow) and we got new tickets through American through British Airways to Pisa. We had about an hour wait after another run through security (1.5 hours) and back to the proper gate. So why didn't American put us on this flight in the first place?

Part of the problem was the need to claim baggage and recheck it which we were not informed of when we booked the flights. It took far too long for our baggage to come and there was no one around to answer questions about whether or not more baggage was coming.

AA did not handle the flight delay well in O'Hare - assigning late inbound pilots who were near time-out for active service on an already delayed departure flight to an airport with a curfew time. O'Hare frequently has runway holds and queues to make things even later. We ultimately returned to a different gate due to timed-out pilots for our now cancelled flight but then they didn't have the staffing available to open the gate and get us started with rescheduling flights for an additional 20 minutes - blowing any chance of catching some of the last flights to Southern California for the night. It was just one setback after another. My recommendation, if your flying AA - stick with the hub in DFW, at least they may have the extra resources there to keep things moving. I was dumbfounded by the decision tree and mitigation process for the not so uncommon event of a cancelled flight at O'Hare. No hotel help, a silly dinner voucher for some restaurant that might be open in the terminal after midnight, and just not a whole lot of explanation.

Ground service was excellent. Flagship Check-In was fantastic, very spacious and modern space away from the crowd. After check-in, I was escorted to the front of the TSA Pre-Check Line and was done with security in two minutes, although I wish the agent was more jovial. Flagship Lounge great with plenty of breakfast options and an extensive beverage selection. The lounge was not crowded. Seating was comfortable and WiFi was fast. Overall, a great space with much better food and drinks than the regular lounge. Flight was good. Seats were spacious with tons of storage. Power ports, USB plugs, remote control and a bunch of other features located by your seat. Seat was private, minor complaint would be the firmness, wish there were a lot more soft like the ones they have on the Boeing 767-300s. TV screens were huge, great interactive map with plenty of entertainment options. The purser was interactive and friendly, although they lack some finesse. She dropped my appetizer on the floor and constantly spilled liquid on my tray table.  Food in abundance, they also introduced a new menu that I got to try out. Appetizer, main and dessert were all good quality, although nothing memorable. Salad was extremely disappointing. It tasted and looked like leftovers from a prepackaged bag of salad and the dressing was oily. Overall, food could have been better although for a flagship route, American should step up their game, considering Delta offers excellent inflight meals on shorter flights. All in all, the flight was great. Excellent ground service, good service, great seat, although food needs some improvement.",7american-airlines,11/07/15,"The flight was okay. Legroom fine, snacks were okay, the average you would expect from a domestic flight. However, let me emphasize on the poor baggage handling on this flight. We arrived at the Terminal, 4-5 hours before boarding time, just to be sure. We were allowed to check-in. However, upon arrival at our final destination (STL), our bags were not with the plane. They were not on any of our flights! As it turns out, our bags never left New York.  We thought that being very early for our flight guaranteed every detail to be fine, including our luggage. However this event was truly a disappointment.  I still would recommend this airline to other people, as my other flights were fairly average, and didn't go wrong like this one.",7american-airlines,11/07/15,"Toilets were fine, seating was good.

On the return home, we missed our connecting flight in Charlotte because there was congestion on the runway. The next flight was not for three hours. Then that plane was late and needed repairs, so after seven hours in the airport, we finally got on a plane to fly the 45 minutes from Charlotte to Atlanta.

Predictably, the flight was late arriving, which was fine, as the connecting flight to LAX also was delayed. To 10 am. Then 11 am. Then the sign at the gate said to check at 3 pm. The aircraft was having ""maintenance"" issues which I learned only by calling the Platinum Desk. The plane was removed from the gate and taken back to the hangar. We were told we'd be boarding at 3.30 pm. And some of us - perhaps 10 - did board, only to be told to disembark. The pilot had ""timed out"" after waiting around all day like the rest of us. A few minutes before 4 pm, another pilot showed up and boarded the plane, but he strode off after a few minutes. The flight was then canceled altogether. I managed to secure a seat on a 6.17 pm flight to LAX via Chicago. In the meantime, I complained to a gate agent about the inadequate service and ""surly, ill-mannered, uncommunicative"" agents. The flight to Chicago eventually took off, and we connected from there to LAX, arriving at the California airport around 11.15 pm. My original itinerary had me arriving at 11.29 am.

I wasn't looking forward to the old B767 that we would fly either. But flight took off on time and wasn't that bad. I slept most of the time, partly due to a lack of personal entertainment. The only entertainment was an overhead screen showing some terrible movie. Crew was good, particularly one. Can't remember his name but you'll know when you meet him.

The airport in Miami is huge and after the last gate change, we were told that our flight would leave in 30 min. The AA agent made one phone call for assistance and then left us to our own devices. We had to frantically scramble to find a golf cart, wheelchair, someone to assist. Many of the other passengers on the flight were outraged and not one AA representative gave us any reason why our flight kept getting postponed. Finally, when we boarded at 11.30, the pilot explained that extreme weather kept us from leaving on time.

I was even told the mobile app doesn't communicate with flight counter so its information can be incorrect. So the question is what's the point of the app if doesn't provide up-to-date info. Flight booked for next day. So we incurred cost of overnight near JFK and incurred cost of night at destination. No offer to assist with accommodation for overnight caused by the cancellation.

On June 21st we drove 2 hours to Charlotte Airport and on our way we got an automated call telling us our flight had been cancelled for maintenance (at around 11.30) on a beautiful, clear day. Not knowing what to do we continued to the airport terminal and through the check-in line. The employee at the check-in said we had been rescheduled on a flight for the next day at 5.30am. This wasn't an acceptable alternative for us so we were put on standby for a 4.30 flight but then we had to check-in our stowaway luggage. We asked how we would get our luggage back if we didn't make it on the 4.30 flight, and were told that the luggage was marked for standby and would not be put on the plane without us. Past security we checked with other United Airways employees who assured us this was the case. These employees were all helpful and patient with us. We waited in the airport for hours for the standby flight, which unsurprisingly did not have space for all 4 of us. We were sent to baggage claim and waited for luggage that never showed up. Our bags had been sent to Toronto YYZ without us. I called Toronto Pearson airport where a helpful woman connected me to the United Airways baggage office. Finally I was satisfied that they probably weren't going to send our luggage back to Charlotte, and we drove up north.

The flight that was suppose to board at 9.40pm did not get cancelled until just before 2am. I had already been traveling for 14 hours. I waited in a ridiculously long line only to be told that the hotels in the area were all booked and that the cots at the airport were taken. I did not sleep at all. I had to re-route my original flight from LAX twice because one of the workers routed me to San Jose which was 6 hours away from my destination (LAX). They re-routed me again an hour out of the way at John Wayne airport and had to find someone else to pick me up because of the change of my arrival.

These things sometimes happen, but what followed was not acceptable. Customer service representatives had no solutions for anyone, other than bookings for the next flight 24 hours later. No hotel, transportation, nothing. My service at the desk was dismissive: we can't help. We have no solutions or contingencies. It was only after my pestering them, when she handed me the dreaded ""pink slip"" - a generic phone number and website for ""discount"" on a hotel. The biggest problem is that customer service failed spectacularly at the point where the client is most vulnerable and alone-in transit. There should be a representative for each imperiled connecting flight, or group of flights. On-ground coordinators should be communicating with gate agents and in-flight attendants.

The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned.

Next to that 2 changes of gates - terrible!",1american-airlines,15/06/15,"First trip on the reconfigured B777 business class and I was impressed. Virtually identical to the CX layout, which I love. Quite a bit of privacy and personal space, with a very comfortable flat bed. IFE had ample choices, and the food and beverage was good as well. In flight overseas WiFi worked very well also. Flagship check in at LHR in a separate and dedicated building makes the process very easy. I think AA has upped their game on the overseas routes - perhaps not all - but this was an excellent trip.",8american-airlines,15/06/15,"First overseas trip in the newly configured B767 with flat beds. The cabin looks very crisp, clean, and modern but I found the seats to be uncomfortable and poorly designed. The seats seem very narrow, and once in the flat bed position your feet end up in a narrow, confining box-like area which makes it difficult to move around. Impacted sleep quality immensely. Tablet-based IFE strange, clunky with limited choices. The biggest positive surprise was the food, which was as good an airline meal as I've had. Perfectly roasted duck breast in a coconut lime curry was restaurant quality, salads fresh and crisp. On balance better than expected and an improvement for AA.",7american-airlines,14/06/15,"AA has completely lost my trust. The woman at the check in counter knew nothing about free bags for military civilians. After paying for our bag, she gave us our boarding pass and mentioned nothing about it being delayed. We found out after I noticed that the time was different on our boarding pass. When the time came to board, we find out that the flight is cancelled when we noticed no plane at our gate. We approached some AA attendants and the woman apologized for forgetting to announce it, and then looked for another flight for us. She found one for a 5am flight - 4.30am check in and gave us a hotel voucher of which the shuttle runs every half hour. That means we would have to leave the hotel at 3am in order to make the flight. At 2.30am, my boyfriend finds out through the flight tracker to discover it is cancelled again! He tries to call customer service to reschedule but had a 1 hour wait time on the phone. When he finally gets through, the man on the phone suggested a flight at JFK at 7am, which we wouldn't be able to make it in time even if we left at that moment (3.40) because we would have to wait for the (every 30 min) shuttle, get on the airport train, get to the stop for long term parking, then get the bus to get us to our car, and then drive over an hour to JFK. So then he puts us on a 3.50 flight to Chicago getting us there at nearly 6pm. Our whole Saturday is gone. AA wasted us a lot of money and time. I will never fly with them again. ",1american-airlines,13/06/15,"What has happened? Airlines have revolved into greedy money making machines and in turn allowed people to become smug and uncaring for others. What used to happen in my day when a person of 6ft 5ins boarded a plane there was consideration and care? Now it is all about extra money! I distinctly remember when this situation arose we would kindly ask smaller exit seated passengers to swap and 9 times out of ten people would be happy to do so. We maybe would offer a few drinks in return and everyone was happy. My son who is 6ft 5in was like a caged animal on our recent American Airlines flight, 10 hours of absolute hell. Yes we could have paid more for an exit seat but he is a student and this was not an option. While shorter passengers get seats for less he is now faced with either having to pay more to travel than shorter people or not travel at all. It is not as if he can do anything about his height, if he was simply overweight â€“ then he could diet â€“ but this is not the case. American Airlines allowed him to stand up all the way from LA to LHR for 10 hours, when he had to sit his legs had to be wide apart and any chance of a brace position would be completely ruled out. American Airlines â€“ shame on you for your greed! I am not sure why trolleys were used for the meal service â€“ they could have just chucked boxes of junk down the cabin and asked those interested to catch them. ",1american-airlines,13/06/15,"I flew non-stop from SLC to MIA on a redeye, 4 hours of flight time, no problems, delighted to find a non-stop flight. A week later, coming home, (June 10 2015) was a totally different experience.  The flight to DFW was delayed for a mechanical problem (air speed indicator), so they re-boarded us on a different plane, but after all
passengers were seated and the safety video shown, they said there was another mechanical problem (didn't identify it) and sent all 200 of us to a re-booking desk which couldn't possibly accommodate all of us.  Meanwhile after an hour standing in line, they called us back to the second airplane and the ones of us who hadn't left in search of another flight, toted rolling bags etc on board yet a third time and we sat and continued to wait while the baggage was loaded. This leg of the trip had begun with the supposed 12.25 pm departure of Flight 2407, but by now it was 5.30 pm, with no signs of hope. I knew I'd already missed my connecting flight to SLC, and was able to book another DFW flight for 6 pm.  I made it in time to board this different flight, but the 6.00 departure time turned out to be 7.00pm.  The delay here was for yet another unexplained reason.  Still,  I was able at DFW to make my connecting flight to SLC on a 10.00 flight, but this interminable day stretched out far longer than it should have, and I don't see how it could be, that every single AA flight I was on that day, all had delays. The staff were friendly and helpful, but, I can't recommend this airline. ",1american-airlines,12/06/15,"A friend and I flew JFK-BOS-MIA-CUR last minute and at an incredibly low cost. BOS-MIA we got 'upgraded' to Main Cabin Extra for no apparent reason. Check in was actually surprisingly smooth and efficient, friendly staff. Out of the 12 Cabin Crew on the 3 legs 9 didn't spare a smile, didn't manage to finish the 'service' (consisting of 1 complimentary drink) and seemed to be tired and/or just hated their job. 2 were plain rude to fellow passengers for no apparent reason as well as unprofessional and only 1 of the 12 was outstandingly nice and cheery as well as professional. Aircraft old but decent enough, no entertainment (one leg not even safety demonstration after all screens didn't work). On ground experience and price top, inflight flop.",2american-airlines,12/06/15,"This is the 3rd time this year that I have flown with American Airline, I give this airline 1 star out of 5 stars. Number 1 reason is this airline has constant delays all across the board, every flight I have flown on has been late or delayed for the past 3 times this year. I will never fly with this airline again. I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of service and the delays they have for every flight.",1american-airlines,11/06/15,"Just returned from a trip to the Caymans for a wedding, and as usual had a bad experience on American.  I had hoped that the pending merger would improve Americans quality, but instead I'm afraid it will make USAir worse.  I used miles and flew business class on USAir - cost 120,000!  The plane was actually an American plane, and was dirty, with torn, worn out, uncomfortable seats. Service was marginal.  I keep having bad experiences on American, and have actually decided to use up my miles and change to another carrier - it is sad to see how airline travel has degraded - dirty, worn out, cramped, buses with wings.",2american-airlines,06/06/15,I travelled to and back from LGA. Going was actually with US Airways. The staff on both journeys were rude although the LGA to LHR flights were better. Going to LGA staff were rude and not helpful when serving food. The entertainment system was okay although have seen better the touch screens do not work properly. I was sat at the front so luckily had good space however the other seats seemed tight. The second part of the flight (domestic one) was a two by two carrier and the tiniest aircraft I had seen. I would not recommend and I would avoid at all costs.,2american-airlines,06/06/15,My husband and I flew to London in business class on 4/29/2015. Plane was old business class seats were too close to each other the food was the worst ever. Toilets were dirty. We will never fly American Airlines business class anymore. Very unsatisfied customers. We usually fly Qantas business to the U.S. from Australia and let me tell you that it is a first class airline! I'm flying back to London on July 9 business class flying with BA never again AA. Very dissatisfied customers.,1american-airlines,06/06/15,American Airlines without notification or reason cancelled my ticket on the return leg of my trip leaving me stranded. The flight to Seattle from Philadelphia went smoothly. I was able to check in board and fly without problem and it was actually one of my most pleasant flights. However when I tried to check in for the return flight I was informed that my ticket had been cancelled. After waiting on hold for a long time one of the American Airlines representatives informed me that the ticket was cancelled because I never boarded the plane in Philadelphia. Eventually I was told that if I showed my boarding pass from the flight from Philadelphia to Seattle to a check-in representative they would be able to book a seat on the flight for me. However until that time the seat was not reserved for me or guaranteed in any way. It was important that I make the flight in order to be at work so I had to make an extra trip to the airport early so I could re-book my ticket thereby wasting precious vacation time. So do not fly on American Airlines unless you enjoy the thrill of not knowing if you'll get to use the ticket you bought the mystery of whether the airline knows you're on the plane or not and the excitement of using vacation time to pick your way through a companies complex inaccessible and unable customer service system.,american-airlines,04/06/15,First Class JFK - Seattle June 1. Although the flight was delayed almost two hours due to a combination of weather aircraft delays etc.. the flight was fine. The JFK ground crew worked with a combination of humor and professionalism that provided the right touch at the gate and once the aircraft arrived everyone worked very quickly to get us on our way. Once in flight we had warm service in the small front cabin (737-800) by two experienced yet friendly attendants. The food was definitely an upgrade from recent trips and all in all I felt American did a good job. Baggage delivery at Sea-Tac was awful.,8american-airlines,31/05/15,May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn. I have tried many other airlines for long distance flights being in Europe or Asia and none of them were as bad as this one.,1american-airlines,31/05/15,"Flew with my wife from Seattle to Charleston with stops in DFW and DCA. Selected the least expensive flights and we are not frequent travelers so I did not expect a great experience. Our flights did get rescheduled probably due to the merger with US Airways. Delays were manageable with just one hour on the first leg out of Seattle. What I did not expect was for the flight attendants to be so curt and rude. When I was denied a blanket I could almost read the attendants mind (""please put me out of my misery""). Impolite doesn't even begin to describe their attitude.",3american-airlines,31/05/15,"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. One of the passengers asked the flight attendant if she will get her connecting flight and the attendant replies ""We just have to keep hopes. That is all we can do""!",1american-airlines,29/05/15,I flew from IAH Airport to DFW as a layover and then DFW to ORD as the final destination on Saturday May 23rd. The flight leaving IAH was on time and arrived on time to DFW. However the flight from DFW was delayed by 45 minutes because the plane was coming in from Montego Bay Jamaica. So we had to wait and it took an additional hour to arrive at final destination.,6american-airlines,28/05/15,All four flights were terrible and the disorganization and poor customer service was inexcusable. We didn't experience anything like mixed up flights or delays that lasted too long but what we did experience was bad enough. We left for an international flight that departed at 6am they had such slow kiosk and desk service that almost an entire flight of people barely made it on the plane. Kiosks weren't working the people that worked there didn't even know what was going on and were flustered. The anxiety level was high because we all thought we might miss our flight due to American Airlines awful check in service. Instead of reassuring people that the flight wasn't going to leave without 75% of it's passengers. The wifi isn't free it doesn't work half the time and they boast 'free' things to watch and it's all a scam. For as much as they charge for a flight something as little as wifi can make a huge difference. We were on an international flight and they don't even offer snacks you have to buy snacks! I had a bad cold coming home and asked the flight attendant for some cold water and hot water and tea. She rolled her eyes at me and brought me hot water and cold water and no tea. I had to ask for tea from another flight attendant who practically threw it at me. I went to the bathroom during the flight and asked a flight attendant for tissues (again I had a bad cold) she was sitting down looking at her phone and didn't even look up at me just pointed at the bathroom. On the flight home there was a group of people that were obviously traveling together and were so disruptive and rude. They were standing up in the aisle talking loudly and there was a toddler with them that kept running up and down the aisle. The flight attendants never once controlled the situation even though all the other passengers were clearly annoyed and people were saying so out loud.,american-airlines,27/05/15,Flew May 9 2015 from Boston to Paris. I am 75 yrs old and having lived both in South Africa and Europe have done a considerable amount of flying. This flight was absolutely the worst ever. Conditions regarding space and comfort (lack thereof) were beyond appalling. People who could not fit their feet under the seat in front of them were forced to stick them into the aisle. I feel that safety is compromised by these conditions and both the US Transportation Department and American Airlines need to seriously consider this issue. I will of course never fly with this airline again. In addition the food was not fit for consumption.,1american-airlines,25/05/15,I flew from Orlando to Barcelona on May 6th with a return on May 18th. It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day. In terms of choosing an airline carrier it is sadly my opinion that airlines such as KLM or Lufthansa offer better service and would be my first choices on international flights.,1american-airlines,20/05/15,ORD-SAT on Apr 9 and RNO-ORD on Apr 23 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Both flights fine with slightly early arrivals and no drama - Obviously older planes showing some wear and tear but comfortable with standard First class seats. FA tending to First Class on the ORD-SAT leg was excellent hard working attentive continuously present in the cabin to tend to the passengers also a bit more formal (in a good way) less chatty (again good) and obviously concentrating on delivering a good service. FA on the second leg more relaxed in delivering service but still ok. Catering for the first (evening) leg was a chicken or pasta choice with the chicken dish bland and just barely edible. Not good enough even for economy on many other airlines. Also strange that AA considers the chicken or pasta choice a First Class offering on a three hour dinner time flight probably only possible on the US market. Wines served were ok and regular refills offered by the good FA. First Class breakfast RNO-ORD leg was cereal with no other option. Again how this can be considered a First Class breakfast for a four hour flight is beyond me. Good premium check-in with no significant lines and manned counters in both ORD and RNO boarding professional and painless. Actually two pleasant flights with good crews but also with sub- par catering. Also of course excellent value due to the upgrade.,7american-airlines,20/05/15,Flight 55 to Chicago due out Sunday morning at 9.30. Sat in airport all day to find out at around 3pm that the flight had been cancelled due to a technical issue. No information from the staff all day. Had to find out what was going on via the website. The flight got rescheduled for Monday. After another hour delay we finally boarded the same aircraft that they where having issues with the previous day. We set off to the runway only to turn back with a technical issue. We were then sat onboard the aircraft for a further 6 hours as they where having the same issues as the previous day. After the 6 hours we where informed that the flight was being cancelled yet again. By this time it was to late to make alternative arrangements. The downfall for me was the job I should have been at on Monday morning had to be cancelled as I could only get there by Wednesday. Total disgrace.,1american-airlines,20/05/15,I had a flight from Chicago to London Heathrow. Flight 46 on 14th May. A Boeing 767-300. Delayed by 2 hours so missed my British Airways connection. Cabin was dull. Worst part no personal screen and seats short on legroom. Felt like all economy passengers were refugees running to some other place. Food was ok but not as good as compared to Air India. Staff were ok too. Will never recommend AA.,1american-airlines,20/05/15,After a 24 hour delay during which time we were not kept informed of what was happening we board another plane. The new plane sits on the tarmac 45 minutes past take off time and only then the pilot informs us there appears to be a problem with the plane so the plane returns to the gate. There are no apologies there is no information and it seems total indifference to people like myself who will miss their connection resulting in a further 8 hour delay. Service is zero professionalism is zero however the aircrew do appear to be putting in a lot of effort to avoid passing among the passengers or making eye contact. Flight 9268 to Chicago.,1american-airlines,18/05/15,I flew Baltimore to Seoul (BWI-DFW-ICN) on 10 May 2015 the flight out of Baltimore had to return to the gate due a cockpit display not working making the flight an hour late on take off. We were then diverted due to weather - admittedly the crew were helpful during our enforced 4 hour plane-bound ground stop in Austin. We finally got to Dallas 5 hours late â€“ â€˜to be greeted by a (non-existent) customer representativeâ€™ the queue for the customer service at C25 was pathetic â€“ two people and a queue of several hundred snaking around the terminal. Fortunately I had my BA executive card and got into the Admirals lounge were the queue was only about 20 people. We (three of us) were rebooked on the flight to Narita (Japan) and onto Seoul the following day. Although technically that flight would have left technical â€˜issuesâ€™ meant that we left 7.5 hours late arriving in Narita at about 11pm. What a contrast - upon arrival there were about 15 Japanese customer service people with individual â€˜packagesâ€™ for passengers containing onward boarding passes details of buses to pre-arranged hotel accommodation and a food box. Next day a special bus took us back to the airport for our onward flight to Seoul. Our luggage was not so lucky â€“ even with the 7 hour delay at Dallas AA was unable to send our luggage out for another 2 days! The return flight was â€˜betterâ€™ â€“ in that there wasn't a delay but the flight was cramped â€“ the 777 clearly had not been â€˜spring cleanedâ€™ since its delivery many many years ago the food was mediocre at best and the â€˜entertainment systemâ€™ simply because it was entertaining trying to find anything of interest to watch/listen to. Quite simply AA (as do other US carriers) provided the absolute bare minimum. Unfortunately it is â€˜company policyâ€™ to only fly American carriers â€“ and probably the only reason that American carriers still exist.,1american-airlines,13/05/15,Flight 2256 to depart IAH at 6pm on 5/12/15 was delayed by one hour. Myself and 2 daughters were on our way to Branson MO for a short vacation with family. This delay made it impossible to connect to our flight at DFW so we had to reschedule our flights to the next day cutting into our planned time with family. I have not flown AA in years due to lost luggage issues previously and this is my experience the first time I tried to use them again. Not only was this a huge hassle with 2 kids to get to and thru the airport (then out again and back the next day) but I'm very disappointed in the fact that our vacation is having to be cut into as a result of the flight delay. Extremely disappointed.,1american-airlines,11/05/15,AA138 DFW-DCA first class. I've really stopped expecting anything when flying domestically in the US or Canada. Flight departed late due to heavy traffic and weather. Seat ok but nothing special on a 737-800. Was in 1A. Having just got off QR from Doha a big change. Cabin crew not friendly Basically had my meal tossed at me. Meal itself was tasteless and over cooked. No control over economy class passengers using first class lavatory even while the seatbelt sign was on. It is getting me home which is about all I can say that is positive about this flight.,3american-airlines,11/05/15,It is not a good feeling when you get ashamed of the company that is representing your country to the world. But it was how I felt when I boarded AA 91 from London to Chicago. The oldest plane ever out of 4 overhead TV (they didn't even fold-this ancient) 2 didn't work. How can you still not have an in seat entertainment on an 8 hours international flight? Noise level in the cabin was at times unbearable. It was the last leg of our round-trip to Greece. First 3 legs were served by British Airways - what a dramatic difference.,2american-airlines,10/05/15,AA2320 - May 7 2015. Inaugural 787 flight on AA - DFW to ORD. Fun flight - a lot of press at the boarding area. Photos were taken of each passenger standing in front of a green screen so that you would get a picture printed with you in front of the plane. 82 people on the upgrade list for a completely full flight - most I've ever seen. Boarding was smooth - about 90% of the passengers were airline/aviation enthusiasts that purposely were on the flight. Flight attendants/pilots were all jovial and happy to show off the new plane. Water-cannon send-off from Terminal D - then a nice smooth take-off with cheers from passengers. Good inflight entertainment - but still they show the same shows that were on flights I took 9 months ago. Why can't American keep updated entertainment? Emirates/Singapore/Qantas/British all do it. Drink and BOB on board - people walking all over the plane between First and Coach taking pictures. Camera-men filming the cabins and passengers reactions. Landed early at ORD and quick disembarkation. Overall a good flight and cheap fare.,8american-airlines,10/05/15,"Just returned from a two week trip to China using AA into Beijing returning from Shanghai. We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious. If this is what we can expect from the American/US Airways merger I will avoid the new company at all costs.",1american-airlines,08/05/15,This was the worst travelling experience! The staff are rude and abrupt at check-in the meals are terrible and you cannot purchase anything else on board they didn't have earphones or the option to purchase on board (for a long haul flight from Philadelphia to Dublin) and none of the reading lights worked in our row. Aside from this the planes are extremely old to the point where it was genuinely terrifying. The insulation is extremely thin in comparison to other planes so you can hear every noise the engine makes! Also the navigation system didn't work as we were landing but the pilot told us not to worry he knew Dublin so he could find the airport!,1american-airlines,08/05/15,I just traveled with my mother to Miami Florida from Calgary Alberta in April we bought our tickets online a month before our trip. We received the flight information by email everything was going fine. The flight down to Miami was great however the return trip was a different story again we checked-in the night before to save time but they overbooked the flight from Dallas to Phoenix and my elderly mother had to pay an extra 35 dollars to be guaranteed a seat on the flight to be able to stay traveling with me. I was asked to check in my carry on in Dallas because they were not going to have enough space in the overhead compartments. When we arrived in Phoenix they announced that the flight was overbooked and asked if anyone was interested in staying overnight and catch the morning flight to Calgary they offered to pay for the hotel and give you a travel voucher I could not take them up on the offer as I had already checked my carry on in Dallas. We bought our tickets a month before I felt that our seats should be guaranteed. The only saving grace of the trip was that the stewards were very nice on the flights.,4american-airlines,04/05/15,"As two couples we traveled Heathrow to Palm Springs via Dallas Fort Worth. The Heathrow flight was on time and the service was ok but not great. A little too ""matter of fact"" if I can use that term. Our flight from DFW was a different affair. Because we couldn't book our seats we were advised to ask at the desk at Dallas. When we arrived I was impressed that they knew we were coming but added"" we think we have four seats spare but leave it with us"". I had already had trouble booking seats from Heathrow with not wanting to pay and extra Â£30 pre booking fee! We eventually did get 4 seats. 2 at the front and two at the back. The attendants were efficient although abrupt. On our return flight again we couldn't book the seats we wanted and got split up yet again on DFW to Heathrow leg. The Staff were quite rude to all passengers. One fellow passenger asked what choice was for breakfast? ""Only one option"" was the reply ""take it or leave it""! We got the impression that they didn't really want to be there. Many reading lights and video screens were not working just what you need on an overnight transatlantic trip! We bought our tickets in September 2014 and we couldn't get seats together when it came to the 24 hr check-in. So what gives. I will say this now; we wont fly AA again and I will not recommend them either. They are advertising ""We are Adding new planes every week"" I think they should repair some of their existing ones first!",1american-airlines,02/05/15,Very happy to write a quick follow up to my recent review indicating that my good experience was not a fluke. LA- Kona first class on a 757. I was served a decent meal by an extremely pleasant crew including the signature sundae. Everything was crisp and professional with a touch of warm. Same comments about sad entertainment system though.,9american-airlines,01/05/15,Just travelled Heathrow - JFK and back in economy. Really happy with the service the stewards were very helpful even giving us info on the best places to eat in New York. The flight was half empty so we could spread out on both flights. It was on time. Food ok and they make sure we had a drink in our hand whenever we wanted. Very comprehensive choice of old and new films/TV. Would recommend.,8american-airlines,30/04/15,I am quite happy to write a positive review of my experience yesterday. Flying from Honolulu to LA on a 757 I was expecting very little. Instead I was welcomed by a warm crew to a comfortable seat and received warm attentive service. The breakfast was quite nice and beverages were free flowing and offered in a friendly manner. The entertainment on a screen ahead was minimal and that was the only second rate part of the trip. The pillow and blanket offered were large and comfy. I hope this signals an upgrade system-wide for a product that has long called for one.,8american-airlines,28/04/15,"Will not be flying with this airline again. Was traveling from Seattle to Houston Hobby through DFW. Plane was delayed on the runway for over an hour because American couldn't communicate with their own computer system in Dallas. Because of the delay we landed in DFW just 20 minutes before my connecting flight was scheduled to leave in another terminal. Hauled over to that terminal only to see a completely different flight posted at my gate with no agents in site. Found another gate with an agent and told him my situation. He put me on standby for another flight to Houston. I was called from the standby list and put on that flight they asked me to gate check my bag. Then after I was seated they called me off the airplane saying they had double booked my seat! They could not return my bag to me. Put me on yet another flight to Houston for two hours later. But that gate listed information for another flight. Talking with other customers it became clear that none of the gates displayed the appropriate flights it was utter chaos with agents switching gates for flights every 15 minutes or so and disgruntled passengers everywhere. Meanwhile it turns out that the flight they kicked me off of was cancelled because the pilot had reached his maximum number of hours before the flight ever left. Everyone on that flight was moved to my new flight. Eventually they boarded the flight and then sat at the gate for an hour because as the captain put it ""someone who needs to be on the flight is not on it."" The passenger sitting next to me showed me radar on her phone indicating that a storm was rolling in that would prevent us from leaving if we didn't leave soon. Many passengers started shouting to the crew asking why we hadn't left yet and many openly started wondering if the crew was actually making excuses to delay the flight until it was cancelled. Remember that many of these passengers had been on a cancelled flight just a few hours before. Anyway the captain did wait long enough that a storm rolled in as predicted. We were told we would need to fly out of the other side of the airport and circle around the storm so we taxied over. Once we were all the way on the other end we were told the new route required more fuel than we had so we had to return to the gate. Then we were told the ramp was closed so there was no gate for us to refuel at so we had to just wait. Finally a gate opened up for us but we just sat there for another hour. Then the captain told us that he reached his maximum number of flying hours so the flight was cancelled. At this point I cut my losses rented a car and drove to Houston from Dallas.",1american-airlines,28/04/15,This review is being written after a number of times flying with American Airlines. You can almost always expect delays terrible customer service and just an overall bad experience. We had a two hour delay from MIA to SFO which would connect to LAX. The airline representatives were not helpful and made our travel anxiety even worse. Absolutely the worst airline across the board-from aircraft to personnel. How could the customer service be so terrible? The only reason I chose this airline was because it was cheaper than JetBlue. American Airlines is truly a disappointment.,1american-airlines,27/04/15,A321 TPA-IA 737 MIA-YYZ. First leg delayed by over 1.5 hrs. Missed connection by 12 minutes. No apologies and stupid explanations. Put us on flight over 5 hours later. Once boarded we sat over an hour waiting for a pilot! Two different stories. Pilot delayed in traffic or pilot was timed out for his duty day and had to find someone else to drive the 737. And of course they lost our luggage. Is this any way for a major airline to operate?,1american-airlines,27/04/15,We had two flights with AA from Madrid to Miami with their 777. The first flight was five hours late no excuse no money. The B777 is one of the worst you can fly with - 2-5-2 seating but AA charges 100 Euro extra for the 2 seats-row. The seating is horrible no space in economy the in-flight entertainment is like 2002 with a small amount of films on re-run every 15 or 30 minutes (by the way my LCD did not work). The worst about AA is the staff - unfriendly tired and virtually throwing the trash food on your seat. Even for a US-carrier AA is under all poor standards. So - stay away. American is like Ryanair but not as cheap. Never again!,1american-airlines,24/04/15,DCA-DFW-SEA-DFW-IAD B737-800 Coach Class for all four segments 04/17 and 04/21. PROS: First Class check-in due to my One World Emerald Tier status; Flights on time except for DFW-SEA that left the gate on time but returned due to a mechanical problem that resulted in a delayed departure of an hour and arrival in SEA 40 minutes late. All planes clean and either new or fairly new. Staff efficient and most were quite friendly except for one on the SEA-DFW segment who had an attitude problem. Snacks for sale on three of the four segments and complimentary beverages served on all segments seats comfortable except for DCA-DFW (see CONS). Baggage transferred efficiently and delivered on the carousels at SEA and IAD very quickly as they had One World priority tags. CONS: The Admiral's Club Lounges look nice with comfortable seats but the free snack offerings at DFW were pitiful DCA-DFW had a brand new plane with the new B737 sky interior and AA leather seats. This was outstanding though sadly ruined by two awful boxes for the seat back video screens anchored on both sides of the middle seat foot well. This was pathetic for legroom on even a three-hour flight; Any airline that can find a very compact version of this video control box is a winner! Overall despite the many negative reviews that I have read recently about AA I was very satisfied with this trip and will definitely use them again. I didn't have high expectations for domestic AA service upon arrival at DCA on 04/17 but they actually did much better on the entire round-trip.,8american-airlines,24/04/15,R/T SFO-JFK. Outbound in business return in F. I think AA is doing a very good job with its Airbus 321 transcons in the premium classes. The seats are excellent both in C and in F. Indeed both are horiz lie flats. IFE is superb. Lots of choices large HD screens and Bose noise cancelling headphones supplied. Service was good in both directions. The food was a 7 on a scale of 10. My main criticism was the lunch in F. It unfortunately conveyed a sense of cut backs. Lounges at both ends were top notch particularly the F lounge at JFK. That is not to say that SFO Admirals was bad. It is truly excellent just that the F lounge is better. Overall on these transcons AA has a quality product.,8american-airlines,23/04/15,"Wife and I booked a trip from Houston to see the son in West Palm Beach on 4/17/2015. Our flight was supposed to be one of the first that left that day so we were ate the airport very early. Check in was 4 am. Of all the flights in the entire airport ours was delayed 2 hours. Why? Because they said it did not get in till late the previous day. Well that delay messed up our connecting flight in Dallas-Fort Worth so the day got worse and our total day was extended 6-7 hours. I understand that there are times when issues cannot be avoided but the airline booking personnel just didn't seem to care. We paid extra for the priority seating but they just threw us in the pool of last place seating until we got in their face. They did give us a meal voucher good for one of the vendors in the airport but only when we had to demand it. The pilot explained that there are rules of mandatory rest between flights which we understand but that news was known the previous day so why did we not get notified? The connecting flight was also delayed due to maintenance of passenger seats. For our return flight home my wife and I were praying for no issues but American Airlines made sure that we would not go home happy. The flight from West Palm Beach to Dallas-Fort Worth was pretty routine in the air but flight was delayed leaving the airport due to some ""auxiliary power"" issue that maintenance had to remedy before take off. When we arrived in Dallas-Fort Worth the powered boarding shute needed maintenance's attention before we could exit the plane into the terminal so we had to wait for that fix. As luck would have it our connecting flight was delayed another 1.5 hours! I will definitely find another airline before I choose this one again. The money you save does not justify the agony or grief this airline dishes out.",2american-airlines,23/04/15,I was scheduled to fly from DFW to HOU Flight 5770 departing DFW 3.10pm arriving in HOU. Instead they notified us that there was no plane. We didn't have a plane to board until 5.30pm and the plane didn't depart until 6.20pm that evening. Over a 3 hour delay due to not having an available plane. Before we took off the pilot notified us that due to weather they were going to have to take a more Western route and were not sure if they were going to have enough fuel. Instead of actually getting more fuel we took off anyway. 30 min into the flight they notified us that there was a line to land into HOU due to weather and that they didn't have enough fuel and needed to land in San Antonio. Not only did we not get into SA until 8pm but the crew notified us that they had flown too many hours. So even if we did get more fuel there was no crew to fly the plane. At this point we were stranded in San Antonio and the weather had become so bad in Houston there were no planes out. We were stranded. After 2 hrs waiting in line the representative informed me I could not get back to Hobby until 7.30pm Monday. Monday I flew back to DFW 1433 to catch another plane 1489 to get to IAH by 12 noon. I took a cab from IAH to Hobby where my car was at b/c this was a better option than waiting all day to get back home. Practically over 24 hours to fly from DFW to HOU. I am extremely dissatisfied with American that I will no longer be flying this airline. Even though American did supply meal vouchers and put us in a hotel this is completely unacceptable.,1american-airlines,23/04/15,I know American is now responsible for US Air so I will put my comments here. I had a 4 leg trip from Houston to Ashville through Charlotte. Tickets were cheaper flying out of Bush but I will go through Hobby next time. Every leg of trip was delayed crowded or a rough ride. Seats were cramped. Snacks were to expensive. I checked my small bag to avoid the storage bin struggle. Our gate at Charlotte was doubled up for two flights from two major airports the information on screens was not updated with delays and confusing. I will pay more and fly another airline or drive before I fly American (US Air).,2american-airlines,22/04/15,My family and I were traveling on March 27 on flight AA 238 from (DCA) Washington Ronald Reagan National D.C. at 5.35 pm to (MIA) Miami International Airport. The airplane was old. We could see where the paint was chipped on the right wing. We had seats 15D 15E and 15F. The seat next to the window would not move back up after it was inclined back. We were landing and we pressed the button and could not get the seat to move back in an upright position. A male flight attention called my attention and I said I could not move it. He said that seats on American were more aesthetic than they are functional. The airplane lacked tray tables. Accordingly when served drinks there was no place to put the drinks. Furthermore not only were tray tables absent from this old plane but even the lock to hold them in place was gone from the plane. The plane had not been properly cleaned before the flight and our flight was overbooked. The seats were very narrow even though we paid for more better seats. My mother who is of normal weight and body proportions had difficulty getting in and out of it. Our earlier trip to Washington DC from Miami was on a newer plane and we didn't have these problems.,1american-airlines,20/04/15,8th April AA57. Return on AA56. This was our first and last trip with AA. We were told we would be flying on the new AA planes. This simply was not true. Why should one pay the same price if you are going to fly on a dirty broken old plane in business with a ridiculous 2 3 2 seating arrangement and the entertainment system broken. We will never fly AA again. They seriously need to up their game to compete with Emirates Singapore etc.,1american-airlines,20/04/15,"This is a rough review because we flew first business and coach. We usually fly coach but for a trip to Napa we used our points to go first class. The AA/United merger combined the worst two airlines in the Western world. Flew on 4/7 (260 / 193) - BAN-DFX-SAN. Service food seating excellent. Plane a little old and shaky but all in all a good flight. Returned 4/13 (193/5290) SAN-Charlotte-BNA. Although we had first class we were relegated to business with an accompanying drop in quality across the board. The trouble is the age of the planes - it's like something from a museum. The noise from the engine was so loud it was like sticking your head under the hood of a car. But for once all flights left on time without mechanical problems. We were closer to the real world of 95% of all travelers with tasteless food (a box handed out at the end of a 6 hour flight with a roll candy bar and smoothy). Entertainment (quote unquote) was from attached dirty ancient screens for which AA would kindly sell earphones. I had my IPAD and kept busy while the Mrs tried to doze. Then at Charlotte it's Reality Time. We got bumped to economy (first row) but the constant groans reminded us that these ""seats"" were once used for unruly reform school students. That was in the 1940's since they were tiny dirty torn and stretched. The place looked filthy. A webbed shower curtain in several pieces separated ""first class"" (real classy) but they did manage to pass drinks to us in the cattle car. Yes we are switching carriers to anyone who has bought a plane in the last 30 years.",5american-airlines,20/04/15,AA flight 2891 on 19th Apr 2015. Flight was late 140 mins due to which I was sure to miss my next connection to Calgary. Technical faults do occur and are understandable. But the issue is how rude and uncooperative the staff were. They had a permanent no for an answer for everything in a most unprofessional way. As a last resort I was booked on same day from San Francisco to Calgary as it was very important for me to be there in Calgary. I had to rush and take ground transportation from Sacramento to San Francisco and working out the next step as I was moving ahead. Forget help no guidance was provided on how I can get to SF airport. Would have accepted same sequence of events if they were delivered to me with a smile. AA staff needs serious training in this aspect of customer service.,1american-airlines,19/04/15,AA 954 on 12th April 2015. Truly awful service from Buenos Aires to NYC. Flight staff were alternately incompetent angry or non-existent. Bizarre lack of professionalism creates a stressful flight atmosphere. With so many international options never again will we fly American. Not worth the few dollars saved on the ticket price.,1american-airlines,19/04/15,"On April 9 2015 while my wife and I waited to board a flight from Barcelona to NY-JFK there was an announcement that it had been canceled. It was hard to hear and broadcast only once. Several of us had to confirm with an attendant that it was indeed canceled that we had to pick up our luggage at the baggage area and return to the check-in counter. My wife and I along with the others scrambled to navigate our way through the airport area finally to the baggage area. After what seemed like a very long wait our luggage along with a handful of others' came out last. This meant that when we finally found our way back to the AA check-in area we were at the end of an extremely long line. Eventually my wife and I ""split"" with her waiting on a long line at an AA service counter. After about 3 hours she made it to the front while I still had many people ahead of me. AA booked us on Iberia flights for the following day and a hotel with paid meals. We were then given directions to a free hotel shuttle. We never found it and ended up paying for a taxi but the driver took us to the ""wrong"" airport hotel. Fortunately that hotel let us take their shuttle to the ""right"" hotel. It's surprising but almost understandable that AA had no ""backup airplane"". My complaint is less about the cancellation and more about the lack of assistance at Barcelona Airport. Announcements and guidance was poor. There was no one to help us navigate back to the baggage area. We had to wait on a customs line to get back ""in"" so that we could go to the baggage area. We and others had to grab AA personnel passing by to find out anything even in the baggage area. It was an upsetting experience that cost us a day. We will think twice before using AA again & have spread the word wherever we can.",1american-airlines,19/04/15,LHR-RDU economy. I was really impressed with this flight. Ok the plane was the same age as me (28 I checked) and showed it - particularly in not having PTVs for quite a long flight. Seats a little hard. Everything else was very impressive though - food was edible and generous (main meal Ice cream and second snack meal) and regular drinks runs including beer. Staff were incredibly polite and friendly and there was a very relaxed atmosphere which I liked.,8american-airlines,17/04/15,My husband and our teenage son went to visit family in Nashville for two weeks this Easter. We booked our four flights each London-Chicago-Nashville and back through BA. BA were supposed to take us as far as Chicago with American Airlines doing the Chicago to Nashville bit. We missed our connection at both legs of the journey which was hugely inconvenient particularly when returning to the UK. To be fair AA brought us back to Chicago airport in time but for some reason the they were not given a gate for more than an hour. I approached the flight attendant asking whether AA can communicate with BA about this delay particularly as there were several people apart from us who were due to catch the same flight. She said that the flight will probably wait for us they know that we are being delayed. This resulted in a mad run between terminals 3 and 5 in vain. We were then sent back to AA desk in Terminal 3 to rebook our tickets for another flight. AA staff took a very long time to process each person. By the time we finished it was more than 1.5 hrs after we started queuing. We were told that the we will be put on AA flight to London tomorrow afternoon. There are many flights between London and Chicago and we requested an earlier flight. The person dealing with us said that if we wanted tickets to an earlier flight we should have come earlier. She refused to check whether BA had any flights the next day. In fact they were as unhelpful as possible. I made a point that we paid tickets for the flight that just left and had we managed to be on it we would not be asking for anything. We were told that we cannot collect our luggage as 'it has gone to BA'. We were given vouchers for an airport hotel and forced to stay overnight without luggage and they reluctantly gave us two sets of very basic things such as toothbrush and toothpaste for us three. The next day at AA check in desk we were told we need to collect our luggage at luggage collection No 5 after which we needed to bring it back upstairs and check them in. They could not locate our luggage. As the time for our next flight was approaching my husband ran to the check in desk to let them know that our luggage never materialised whilst I waited at carrousel No 5 in case it does. We asked if we could be upgraded if there were any spare seats in the premier class and the staff member said 'we do not upgrade for such a reason'. No other option would make me use this airline again.,1american-airlines,16/04/15,"Non-existent customer service. Recently flew JAN-DFW-ELP. Delayed and missed connection in DFW due to weather. Had to overnight. No help whatsoever from AA because of ""weather"". No vouchers no distressed travel rates no phone number to call for booking my own hotel and had to walk 20 gates for hilariously cheap toiletries kit that was given grudgingly. Surly agents throughout. Truly an example of the worst in airline culture. To top it all off was unable to be booked on next morning flight and missed work. Agent could only put me on a later flight. Said I was put on FC upgrade list however. The next day when I was told I was upgraded they wanted $70 for the 1 hr flight. Agent said ""well it's not free"". I am AAdvantage Gold which is meaningless. Now a hostage to them with my new location but will take United or Southwest whenever possible in the future. People understand weather issues but the total lack of even the most basic customer service and rude behavior/attitudes is appalling about this ""airline"". Previously flown with Delta extensively and they always handled weather delays and misconnections in ATL professionally and courteously. So it can be done AA just doesn't care.",1american-airlines,14/04/15,Original flight was scheduled to depart at 10.30 am from DFW. Flight delayed too many times to count. Right now we are at 4 hours past (2.30 pm) I am on the plane have been sitting here with no air flow or electricity for about an hour. We were told that the flight crew was coming from OK however all the passengers from OK are on board and the flight attendants said they could not find pilots. This type of incompetence and lack of communication does not instil a lot of confidence in my safe arrival at my final destination. Although AA was $100 cheaper than United I will never fly with AA again.,1american-airlines,12/04/15,Flew American three times in the past two weeks. All domestic. 1) San Francisco to O'Hare Chicago. 2) LaGuardia NYC to O'Hare Chicago. 3) O'Hare Chicago to San Francisco. Good: on time performance. Did not experience delays Bad: 25$ for a checked luggage? Come on! What are you? A Low Cost Carrier? And because of this many people opted for a carryon resulting in overcrowding of overhead bins. There were simply not enough space for all carry-ons. Bad: flight attendants! No smiles! Not very attentive. They looked tired grumpy and stressed! Bad: IFE! No individual screens. Bad: old single aisle Boeing planes. Bad: you have to pay for everything. Complimentary drinks limited to water canned sodas and juices.,5american-airlines,12/04/15,LHR-DFW return on 777-300ER. I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.,5american-airlines,12/04/15,I have just flown American from London to Miami with a connection to Cancun. The flight AA 57 due to leave at 9.45 am from London was delayed by 1hr 35 minutes with no apology or explanation as to why. The delay coupled with a customs shambles in Miami meant we missed our connection. The Express tickets (red ones) were a complete waste of time we just joined the queue with everybody else and the lady at the next baggage check in was totally disinterested and dismissive. I am frequent flyer an this was booked via BA and was a very poor customer experience. I will avoid American at all costs in future.,1american-airlines,12/04/15,LHR-MIA March/April. We were sold this round trip on the 'new' AA Business Class product. We knew it was a 777-300ER LHR-MIA and a 777-300 back. The outbound was fantastic with great service seats AVOD and everything one should expect from a modern BC cabin. we have flown Emirates BC 4 times in the past 6 months and this cabin is comparable to both the A380 and the 777 in that class defining airline. Whilst we found the service in Emirates a bit disorganised AA was efficient friendly and warm we like the more mature no nonsense crew on Airlines out of the States although it's a thin line to rude and dis-interested on occasions! However AA should be ashamed scheduling a 200 version for the return leg which was not a result of a last minute 'change out' due to failure but that quote ' The newer plane has been stolen for Los Angeles some weeks ago'. Call me sad but I would have changed my flight if I'd known we'd be on this antique! Lie at an angle beds a 10 inch screen maybe 11 low def (love the jumpy fuzzy effects reminded me of the 90s) and the general feel of a very tired plane! What was different was the excellent service and food I was annoyed when I sat down but slept for 3 hours and was relaxed when I got off. AA has begun to catch up it's got some way to go and given the lounge experience (don't ever ever call sparkling wine Champagne!) there is a way to go the crew are spot on and at the end of the day that's what makes a flight. Seat score is for the 777-300ER but oddly it's not great for couples as these seats are very. 'Pod' like and chatting to each other isn't easy AVOD score is the new plane.,7american-airlines,06/04/15,Flew Boston to Barbados via Miami March 10 returning March 17. Managed to buy a cheap upgrade to First Class Boston to Miami which was good - though American airlines first class doesn't measure up to the first class of other airlines. One good flight out of four. The rest was economy all the way and truly miserable. Miserly leg room have to pay extra for everything ground staff ranged from hostile to comatose cabin crew completely indifferent. Was made to feel like a dollar bill squeezed till I squeaked. AA operates for its shareholders not its passengers.,1american-airlines,06/04/15,Flew from San Francisco to DFW (Dallas) for my connection into Houston Hobby (04/05/15) just to sit around for hours the airline changed the departure time at least 7 times then in the end it was cancelled and do you think they had the decency to have a ticket agent at the booth no mysteriously the agents all disappeared right before the cancelled notice went up on their board. No one instructed us to do anything I went to other agents and they just told us they could not help. Just ridiculous all around meanwhile Mother's and children traveling alone sitting at the gate crying trying to figure out how they were going to get home. I ended up having to get a rental to make it to my final destination on my own. All American Airlines does is inconvenience people the final straw was when the agents at the rental car counter stated that American does this every week to folks who are going to Houston Austin and Lufkin so it was nothing new to them they claim mechanical failure! If they supposedly have new planes and they are investing in all this new equipment where is it? Why don't they use some of those new so called planes they have purchased! This was a less than an hour flight come on American have some common sense!,1american-airlines,03/04/15,From LAX to PVG (Shanghai) the worst business class. Most of the flights to Asia have much better business seating. The middle row has three seats if you are in the middle of the middle row you must cross someone to get in and out. The seats configuration is old and looks very dark and unpleasant. Larger screen for movies but not very many good selections.,2american-airlines,03/04/15,AA are making a big thing about all the new planes they are buying. I flew from Heathrow to JFK 27th March on a really smart 777. That's where the complements end though. I have never flown with a worse cabin crew. They all wore different clothing as though they had turned up from home and not bothered to change. They were totally uncommunicative - amazingly not a word was spoken to us through the entire journey. One of the crew fell asleep in a seat at the back of the cabin. Food was served as though they were doing us a favour and just dropped in front of us without a word there was not a friendly smile between them. One of the crew was not tall enough to close the overhead lockers. I cannot believe AA are spending so much on renewing their fleet yet seem totally unconcerned that their staff are behaving in this way. I flew back on BA - a fabulous crew who worked their socks off for the customers what a contrast!,3american-airlines,01/04/15,AA flight 397 on March 25th. The first leg of our trip was delayed so we arrived at the gate 7 minutes before the flight was to take off. We had notified the gate agents that we were on the way to the flight but they shut the door in our face and would not let us board. We found out they had overbooked the flight by 50 seats. On the next flight we watched as friends of the gate agents boarded on standby while the rest of us were bumped > again. No gate agents seemed interested in helping us get home. We eventually had to rent a car and drive home since American Airlines would not give us a seat on any flight to get home. An extra $100 and 10 hours delayed we arrived home.,3american-airlines,29/03/15,LHR to MIA Business Class. The plane was one of the older 777-200 with 2-3-2 seating meaning that the person in the middle always had to disturb someone to get out. The seat was ok but not really a true flat bed. The VOD was patchy in that on two of the films I watched there was something wrong with the display so I had to stop it and restart it. The food was very nice - my steak was delicious. Cabin crew were all very friendly and accommodating.,6american-airlines,28/03/15,Travelled with AA February 2015 LHR-MIA return flight out older plane - adequate for a day flight. Thankfully new plane with fully lie flat bed. On return excellent service from cabin staff food also beyond expectations.,5american-airlines,28/03/15,I flew Manchester to JFK and return with AA. On arrival at Manchester the airline staff quizzed us in detail about where else we usually travelled to why we were going to the States what jobs we did. This took about 10 minutes. Check in was via a machine designed to make AA a staff saving however it did nothing for their customers most of whom were frustrated at its inability to work. The whole crew were late and ran through the airport together to take up their posts. Did this account for them not checking whether the passengers had on their seat belts or arm rests in the correct position? Apparently not as it was exactly the same on the return flight. The safety video could not be viewed by passengers seated by the window due to the low overhead and central hanging videos. Did the crew have a uniform? They all dressed differently some wore extensive amounts of jewellery and chewed gum others had not even combed or tidied their hair. All were markedly scruffy compared to every other airline I have ever flown with. More worrying was that none of the crew advised passengers to remain seated when the seat belt light was lit and passengers proceeded to walk around the cabin throughout the flight. Or maybe it was the Captain's error in not turning the light off at all. Who knows whether we even had a Captain as on the out flight no announcements were even made! Not impressive on safety at all. Lets face it food comfort etc are also important but if an airline fails on basic safety the rest pales to insignificance.,1american-airlines,25/03/15,I have the time to write this review due to the third delay I've had with this airline. Not a single good thing I can say about my experience with American. I have flown Southwest Delta Jetblue Frontier and this is by far the worst airline I have flown. We had an hour and a half delay the first flight plus an emergency situation so we missed our connecting flight which has never happened to me. They supplied us with the worst hotel overnight. It wasn't just us that missed our flight 5 other families on separate ones missed theirs too. Then the flight the next day got delayed 30 minutes! So our three day trip turned into one day from all the delays and missed flights. Finally heading home and they announce mechanical problems with the plane. So now the flight is delayed 2 hours and we are missing our connecting flight to Salt Lake. So we get to board on a 6 pm flight but let's not kid ourselves that'll be delayed too so probably 7. And then it's a 4.5 hour flight so I'll be getting home at 2am. Other airlines can figure it out so please do to and spare us all the pain and frustration.,1american-airlines,23/03/15,"Due to a booking snafu (which may have been of my making) and the flight being oversold our non-stop return flight LHR-RDU was unavailable. The courteous and helpful ticket desk staff re-booked our free ticket LHR-JFK-RDU. We were told with great pride that the transatlantic portion would be aboard AA's new flagship 777-300ER. I applaud AA as being the only U.S. airline to give it's customers the opportunity to ride the latest and finest of American ingenuity technology and manufacturing excellence. It did strike me however that AA may have commissioned a ""lite"" version of the plane as it was missing some of the bells and whistles I had seen on some foreign carriers (wood floors mood lighting etc). Overall the economy interior can best be described as bland. On the plus side mammoth overhead bins decent seats great ride and as good an in flight entertainment system as you'll find anywhere in coach. Watched three excellent first run movies. All we need now is some edible food and AA will have caught up with BA and VS. However as a word of caution to those flying from the US to the UK on AA be aware of the aircraft type when you make your booking. In addition to the new AA Flagship 777-300 the airline also flies the 777-200 which is getting along in age the venerable 767-300 and the 757-200 which in my opinion is not at all suited to Transatlantic travel.",8american-airlines,20/03/15,New York (JFK) to Antigua during the very bad snow on the US East Coast. Early morning departure was going well until we reached the gate and found that a problem with a burst pipe meant no baggage could be loaded. However assume this was a knock on from the weather conditions. We were kept relatively well informed about delay which extended to around 3 hrs. However the anticipation of arriving in 85 degrees warmth mitigated the delay. Service on aircraft was fine. We had seats with extra leg room. Inflight entertainment ok. Only soft drinks were free. We had an egg sandwich which was OK. Flight back was also delayed slightly but made up time to arrive near to scheduled time. No queue at immigration. However all this came to nought due to baggage problem at aircraft which meant we waited an hour for bags to arrive. No complaints about flight crew either way - clearly not as customer focused as Non US airlines but efficient.,8american-airlines,18/03/15,Flew RDU-LHR on a free economy ticket. I prefer other airlines but the RDU-LHR non-stop convenience trumps all. It also gives me the opportunity to judge the progress of the AA/USAir merger. On the downside the venerable 767-300 is one year older (27 years and counting) still has the mail slot overhead storage bins the ancient hanging screen entertainment and the excruciatingly uncomfortable seats. I did notice that this old warhorse had been updated with blended winglets to save money which I'm certain they pass along to those paying for tickets. On board the hot breakfast croissant has been replaced with a box of sugar laden treats and the dinner has regressed from merely uninteresting to inedible. The flight attendants are excellent given what they have to work with - even giving up their crew rest seats to accommodate the spring breakers who made this a 100% full flight. On the plus side a current movie that I had considered paying to see (Whiplash) swift check-in and 45 minutes early into LHR. AA doesn't seem challenged to upgrade their transatlantic game but unless you're flying from RDU there must be a better option to get from the U.S. to the UK.,3american-airlines,18/03/15,Flew JFK to Manchester. First disaster came when checking in for flight to be told as a group of 6 we couldn't be seated together. Then it got worse as we couldn't be sat as couples unless we paid $260.00 per couple. Once on board we were sat apart. The cabin crew were at best unkempt and rude. The meal we were served was awful. Only 1 toilet was working for the full economy cabin on a 757 this is not good on a 6 hour flight. Overall a disappointing experience and will not fly on American again.,4american-airlines,18/03/15,AA 280 ICN to DFW. Was flying with an economy ticket got an upgrade to business kind of last minute. Aboard as my husband was flying in first class (empty cabin) the purser invited me to join him. What a difference it makes. So glad for the double upgrade in the same flight. Service was good purser was friendly service oriented and professional. The 777-200 is showing its age but the first class suite is still very comfortable.,9american-airlines,17/03/15,London - Miami Return January 2015 (Boeing 777). I could only choose where I wanted to sit 24 hrs before my flight which was fine as most airlines have that policy but what really threw me back was that all aisle and window seats cost an extra $69 - $100 each way depending where the seat was located! You have to pay extra for an aisle seat at the back of the plane on a 10hr transatlantic flight? This is not easyjet or Ryanair for goodness sake! The so called cheap flight on a major airline was not so cheap after all as they were already nickel and diming before getting off the ground. I refused to pay and went for a free middle seat which I loath I have wide shoulders and have to hunch inwards my plan was to arrive early and hope the check-in desk could sort me out with an aisle seat which they were able to do but that is where the Customer satisfaction stopped.) Plane was on time and boarding was reasonably quick and I was perched in my aisle seat which was very narrow I also noticed many people getting their roller cases stuck in the aisles as they tried to roll them down but it turns out that in an effort to squeeze an extra seat in each row American Airlines compromised with narrower seats and aisles. In the air nightmare #1 The narrow aisle caused one particular cabin crew to bump the trolley into my shoulder or elbow without even so much as an apology. #2 You get free beer and wine but the entire cabin ran out beer and white wine before the first drinks trolley finished its first pass. #3 The plane was old and the only movies available played at set times (not on demand) that's right 2015 with 90s technology - AA may have painted their planes but they are still old and nasty inside. Worst of all it was the same experience on the return leg mercifully the flight was 60 mins less - A truly awful transatlantic flight!,2american-airlines,17/03/15,Flying home from Rochester NY to Los Angeles CA I had to change planes in Chicago. Our flight from Rochester landed with plenty of time to make the connecting flight. One problem is that we had to park on the tarmac for one and a half hours. Another plane was occupying the gate. When we reached the gate it took the employees forever to bring up the valeted bags. I missed the connecting flight and it was late in the evening so there wasn't any available flights. I asked about other airlines in the morning and was told nothing was available. I was given stand-by for AA in the morning and if I didn't make that then an 8.05 pm flight was booked for me. AA wouldn't pay for a hotel room so I was on my own. Once I got to a hotel and started my computer I found a United and Virgin America flight for the morning. Of course it cost me more money but I had a meeting the next day and couldn't risk the stand-by status. What a difference dealing with Virgin America customer service over American Airlines. I will only use AA as a last resort in my future trips. American couldn't tell me how many people were on stand-by for the morning flight so I could evaluate my chance of boarding.,1american-airlines,17/03/15,JFK-MIA-JFK. Priority check-in at JFK was awful. The AA staff were absolutely rude and unhelpful to the point that she was yelling. It was an appalling experience. Things got better on-board first leg on a newly configured 767 as a last minute equipment change. The new First Class seats are extremely comfortable. There were tons of storage space and it went completely flat. Flight attendants on this flight were very friendly pro-active and interactive. Breakfast was delicious and creative. Overall an absolutely delightful flight the new cabin is gorgeous. Return flight in Main Cabin Extra and this time ground staff in MIA was much friendlier than JFK. Exit row seats were comfortable and entertainment options were decent. Overall another great experience with AA despite the bad impression at JFK.,9american-airlines,17/03/15,What is the point in paying extra for Priority when the seats are still the same size? Not to mention the overhead bins are not full yet you made me check my one carry-on. This is ridiculous. I planned ahead and packed lightly so I could use a small carry bag. I have an appointment when I land and cannot wait for Baggage Claim. What should have been offered was Priority Baggage PickUp. These items should come off the plane first and be stowed with strollers or other items along with First Class baggage. I will avoid this airline at all costs going forward.,1american-airlines,17/03/15,DUS-ORD-Tampa-LAX-ORD-DUS. We fly on European carriers quite often - but American Airlines have made an art of employing non caring - ignorant and unfriendly staff. I have never encountered such condescending flight attendants - and such arrogance. We flew from Dusseldorf to Chicago as first leg. The seat allocation was a disaster at the airport - my wife was in a middle seat 6 rows behind me. When we asked the check in crew to change it - we were told to take care of it at the gate at the gate we were told to sort it with the cabin crew and the cabin crew? Not our problem - you should have taken care of it before boarding - end of interest. Only after I really got angry - and walked off the plane - telling them to get my luggage off - a steward from the front end of the plane got involved and shuffled people around so we could sit together. Our friendly stewardess then managed to ignore us for the whole trip. Second leg - we were on the last row of an ancient DC9 - with the galley next to us and a toilet door that would not close properly. Return trip uneventful - but one thing is certain - never again American.,1american-airlines,17/03/15,AA78 DFW-LHR March 6 2015. What a disappointing flight on one of AA's ancient 777-200 cabin feels more like a prison cell than business class. Seats in 2-3-2 configuration (haven't had this for 15 years now). Instead of lie- flat seats they still offer lie in s-style and be careful not to slip down to the floor while you sleep. Stewardess climbing over me to cut off the way she had to walk. Food was disappointing as well. Only highlight was the wine selection that was a little bit better than ok. No way that I will use AA again.,1american-airlines,17/03/15,DFW-LHR in B773. Not sure what other people want but I got what I expected. Good steak for dinner accompanied with a nice Pinot Noir form New Zealand seat turns into a comfortable bed IFE is excellent flight attendants had right mix of anticipating what you need and leaving you in peace. on the down side overhead bin space is limited compared to Business cabin.,9american-airlines,17/03/15,LAX-ORD-CDG - First - the segment from ORD-CDG was on refurbished 767 with new style biz class seats. Very nice cabin interiors are better than most European airlines. There were only two small things I did not get - table - very difficult to pull out and angle - to a point flight attendants had issues with it. And second was iPad for entertainment? Really. The planes have new seats! What was worst was that the purser collected the iPads and head phones 4 hours before we landed! So there was no entertainment. And when I asked why they collected it so early they said they were preparing for landing. 4 hours ahead? The same on 777-300ER they keep collecting the headphones at least 1 hour before landing therefore you can't use the system. But the food was ok and apart from the unfriendly purser the staff were nice.,8american-airlines,17/03/15,I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions. It used to be a great carrier.,2american-airlines,09/03/15,Sitting at AEX. Flight 3271 was scheduled for 6.05am. It is currently 8.20am and still not boarded. There is always delays. I travel for business and American is so inconsistent it makes it hard for the business traveler.,1american-airlines,09/03/15,Recently we traveled to Cancun from Calgary Canada with an over nighter in Dallas Fort Worth. Our flights down were for the most part uneventful with only minor delays out of Calgary and Dallas. However coming back on the 28th of Feb was the worst experience we have ever had in over 30 years of flying. We were stuck in an enormous backlog of passengers in Cancun Airport the majority of the backlog was with American Airlines. Not withstanding the fact that there were storms all over the southern US the American staff assisting passengers in the line-up un-organized cluster that accrued in the terminal was appalling! They could not organize anything and upset passengers constantly. They were so incompetent that they would have had difficulty organizing a staff bathroom break. We where in the line-up for 5.5 hours and never saw a listing for our flight till we finally went through security and even then they had the gate location mixed up. A horrendously poor experience.,1american-airlines,09/03/15,"I had an unpleasant experience with this airline on Sunday March 1st. I took a flight from Houston to Chicago then had an hour to connect to my flight to Toronto. The first leg was fine on time and was surprised that a meal was served on a short two hour flight. I got to Chicago checked the departure board and saw my flight was delayed an hour. That was not too bad so I used the washroom came out to get a coffee and decided to check the board for the gate again and to my surprise my flight was then listed as cancelled. Told that even though I had booked first class if I wanted to get to Toronto the next morning it would be in the back of economy told that the only first class available would be in two days. The biggest surprise came shortly thereafter when I went to search for a Customer Relations desk: there was none! There was a system of phones. Eventually a CS agent came to the phone. She told me that the previous gate agent booked me for the following night from Chicago to Philadelphia then a six hour wait to board a 7 am flight back up to Toronto getting me to my destination two days after the original time. I instead took charge and asked if I could get a flight to Buffalo and was placed on one for two hours later. Of course ""weather"" was the cause for the delay but oddly enough only my flight was showing up as being cancelled. I fly often so if weather was a major factor the board should have at least a few more cancellations or delays. Because of this ""weather"" excuse there would be no assistance for a hotel. I was to depart from the L gates and just before boarding there came an announcement that we had to go over to the H gates- - with just minutes to spare. Service has been much better to me by other US based airlines when faced with unusual changes such as weather or mechanical delays-I have had them all. I will stick to my preferred airline and not use AA anymore as this experience plus a similar one last summer with them has completely eroded any confidence that this airline can get me from point A to B on the same day.",1american-airlines,09/03/15,MSP-MIA. A battered old airplane arrives at the gate looking like it would be from 1960. We got inside and some of the monitors were not working and the seats barely reclined. The flight attendants were very nice and passed out drinks but I still don't understand why they do not offer snacks on a 3.5 hour flight. My flight from MIA-MSP was terrible. We arrived at MIA airport getting ready for our flight at 1pm. We find out it is cancelled and the airline did not give us a reason why so we were rescheduled for a 2pm flight. When we went to board the 2pm flight we find out that they cancelled our seats for that flight and replaced them with a 9pm flight. We had to stay in MIA airport for an additional 7 hours! Once the time finally comes to board the flight bound to MSP we get onto the plane which previously came from Mexico City. The flight attendants were very welcoming however they then tell us over the speaker that this plane was out of service and that American Airlines must find us a new plane to fly on. So we get all of our luggage off the plane and leave the gate once again tired and exhausted. We wait in the gate area and find out our plane is located at the opposite end of MIA airport a 25 minute walk/train ride to get to. So we get all of our stuff together and head towards the other gate. Boarding begins immediately on one of the brand new planes and it is delayed an additional hour. The flight finally leaves at 11pm and I was supposed to be home at 6pm originally. We got to Minneapolis at 2am. Do not recommend this airline if you have little kids with you as changes to occur commonly but the flight attendants are great. The flights not so much. American has really gone down in service.,2american-airlines,04/03/15,I cannot find one thing to say about this airline that is complimentary. Had a flight from Orlando to home and arrived 2 hrs early. Line and kiosks were absolutely packed. And why is that? Because there are only 2 check in people working. Of course I am late for my flight and spend the rest of the day trying to get on a stand by. AA workers at the gates very unhelpful and dismissive. Tell me if I am not some kind of gold customer I cant be put on a stand by list. Terrible customer service in every way. I will never fly them again and do not recommend anyone else to either!,1american-airlines,04/03/15,After a cruise in Ft. Lauderdale we took a connector flight to Dallas on the way to Phoenix. Upon arrival had to sit in the plane 2.5 hours as there was a plane in our gate. Because of snow and ice on runway and also because Dallas is not prepared for this and American could not find a pilot we were cancelled. So for the next 24 hours we spend in the Dallas Fort worth airport we spend 8 hours waiting in lines for a flight and slept along with about 100 people on the floors and in chairs in the airport as the hotels were full. I felt sorry for seniors would had to endure this drama as there was little to no help from American Airlines. Finally after 2 cancellations and 1 standby refusal we found a flight to Phoenix.,2american-airlines,04/03/15,Flight from MSP to DFW to MIA was late both flights and each time they were highly unorganized. Late to board and very uninformative to passengers. Flight itself ok. Very uncomfortable seats and I'm an extremely small figured person. Flight returning from MIA to DFW and then to MSP was a disaster! Got to the airport 2.5 hrs early and had American Airlines bump my flight unbeknown to me to a following day! They put me on standby with a confirmed seat and then argued when I didn't get on that I was late when I was there an hour before departure. They did not out me on and when talking to a supervisor and his pawn they did nothing claiming it was not their fault even though I had a confirmed seat on time and they bumped me. They did nothing to appease the situation and the girl behind the counter was very rude! I will never fly them again. Disorganized unprofessional and expensive!,3american-airlines,04/03/15,"After 30+ years of flying American I will now avoid them. My flight from Heathrow to Miami ""First"" was appalling with a complete lack of the usual amenities. The plane was old and tired media system small and ancient only 1 current movie of interest terrible food (inedible) and tantamount to false advertising in my eye to call this ""first class"". Be warned that unless you know the exact year and configuration of the plane you are flying the customer service department won't give you a definite answer you may have the same experience.",1american-airlines,04/03/15,Flew AA Cost Rica-Miami-Toronto. Ancient airplanes with drop down televisions every few rows. Couldn't read anything on the screens. Staff unhelpful and I never saw one of them smile. The man beside me (mistakenly) asked to purchase some cheese and crackers. The attendant literally threw a menu at him and hissed that they didn't have cheese and crackers. The seats were painfully thin and I could not get comfortable even in the Exit row isle. The only bonus you got a full can of pop although I asked for ginger ale and they didn't have any. Service only came through once and people were all complaining that they were parched and would like water.,2american-airlines,04/03/15,Booked on a Sunday morning flight from Miami to New York. Arrived at 6.50 for an 8.10am flight. There must have been 10 lines along a large expanse of the terminal. We were misdirected 4 times to the wrong line. The lines were 4 layers thick and moved incredibly slowly. We stood on one line for 40 minutes before we began to fear we would miss our flight because of the slow pace of check in. The American line attendants were unhelpful. They suggested self- check in but I explained that I had a dog. He then told me I was in the wrong line. The correct line was equally long and I missed my flight. I will never travel AA again. There are other choices between Miami and NY and AA is not less expensive.,1american-airlines,04/03/15,Flew from Philadelphia to Dublin old plane unfriendly staff - one screen for 50 people and 1 movie in 5 hours. Pasta and bread tasted the same and fixed recline for seats. Unsatisfactory! Will switch to another airline next time.,2american-airlines,04/03/15,"Business class LAX-MIA-SXM and back. I booked seats 9 months out. Two weeks before departure my wife and I were separated. After four calls and ""It can't be fixed"" answers it was finally fixed via email. Of the four segments all but the first ones were quite enjoyable. The first a red eye out of LAX was average at best. Smooth boarding rock hard seats that sent my back into pain an hour out; surly unhelpful FA's. As we approached the gate in MIA the FA gave us connection information which was wrong. Had we not checked a board in the terminal we would have been sent so far out of our way we would have missed our flight. The other 3 flights were fine except for the MIA-SXM meal which was inedible. Planes were old but fairly well preserved. All flights on time. At SXM our ""priority"" bags were the last off the plane. Overall small stuff.",8american-airlines,24/02/15,People are getting bigger not smaller. The seats were uncomfortably tight and small. Entertainment terrible can't they put on a recent movie. Not even a cookie was served! The airline attendants were stone faced. When leaving the plane no attendants present. This is the worst airline we have been on. We will never use it again even if it is cheaper. Flights both going and coming were 45 min to 1 hr delayed. We almost missed our connecting flights both times we were the last to board the plane with rude comments from workers that they are waiting for us!,1american-airlines,24/02/15,All four of my flight legs were substantially delayed (one because they couldn't find one of the crew members). The airline took no responsibility for the delays-they did not have enough gate agents did not accommodate passengers who missed connecting flights or were trapped in airports overnight as a result of the delays and were extremely rude to passengers who asked for compensation. The seats were also very tight and I could not fit a normal sized backpack fully under the seat in front of me.,1american-airlines,24/02/15,Very poor long haul experience with American Airlines. Aircraft was ancient with one TV per 6 rows; wording on screens was illegible if sat at the side. Food was in edible. Crew failed to conduct a full cabin secure check with many hazards going unnoticed. Will not be flying American again.,2american-airlines,24/02/15,We paid a premium for a flight from Albuquerque to Orlando getting in at 5pm. As it turned out we could have arrived earlier on the cheaper flight with another carrier. We were delayed as always when flying AA. Eventually got in over 3 hours late. Asked for some level of compensation for getting in late even though we paid a premium for this particular schedule. Received an email saying we won't be giving any compensation and of course could not reply to the email. Sadly I will no longer fly this carrier. It has just been too many problems delays etc.,3american-airlines,24/02/15,"I am mostly an international flyer on Qatar Etihad and BA. I have been flying American a lot in the US in the past 18 months and have to say I have been pleasantly surprised. This weekend there was a bad storm that closed Washington area airports and I had to get back from Miami to make an international departure the following day. Two of my flights were cancelled. The agent at the Admirals Club stuck with it for almost an hour as we strategized a way to get near enough to DCA so I could have options to get home (eventually I got to PHL and rented a car). The only slightly sour note was the agent's supervisor came over saying ""no...no...no.."" and she couldn't be bothered with trying to understand what we were trying to do. Seeing I was now getting really angry the supervisor pulled back and the agent got me near enough on a USAir flight. USAir had their own agent in the Club and he got us on a waitlist for an even earlier flight which proved to be a Godsend. And after all that my baggage eventually made it to DC after the storm with no drama. Of course I am Oneworld Gold and we were flying first class and I didn't have to stand in a mile long line in the main terminal. But that's what you're paying for and often US airlines don't treat you very well no matter how much you paid for the ticket. I also have found AA is incredibly helpful on the phone in changing reservations even on codeshare flights which is something I have to do frequently. Their website is extremely good and links nicely with other airlines if you are on a complicated itinerary that includes one of their flights. I know people who gripe about them but for now they're my go-to US airline.",9american-airlines,18/02/15,Travelled from Miami to London on January 8th 2015 in first class. Very bad service and very shabby cabin. Here's a warning. Our meal was extremely disappointing it was cold and when we complained the meals were taken away and re-heated not safe. Also and worse still was my wife's meal. She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals. This was not denied by AA customer relations so if you have any kind of special dietary needs do not fly AA. Be warned.,1american-airlines,18/02/15,AA from BOS to MIA on Jan 26 (rather than on the 28th to avoid the storm) next in business MIA to Santiago Chile on the 28th as scheduled. Returned in economy Montevideo Uruguay on Feb 10 to MIA (rather than on the 11th to avoid a predicted storm). Finally on to BOS in first on February 12. I wish the in-the-air product always equalled the consistently excellent service we receive at the Platinum desk. Based on three of the four flights we found the experience professional. The flight however from Montevideo to Miami was characterized by perfunctory service with the crew basically invisible expect for the required meal service. When we boarded they were clustered together laughing. No assistance in boarding the very full plane and throughout the flight. AA has a lock on this flight; should do better. Primitive inflight system not working. Ratings below based on MVD-MIA flight not the other three which were fine.,3american-airlines,18/02/15,JFK to GIG on Nov 21st and return on November 30 from GIG to JFK. Flying business class all over the world with different airlines. They are by far the worst that I have experienced. Lousy old planes broken seats and tray tables entertainment system consists of ipads horrible food and drinks selections (half of what is on the menu not available). They are known to cancel flights for mechanical failures. The crew were nice and were aware of their company's issues.,1american-airlines,18/02/15,LAX-DFW-MEX and return - First/Business Class. My expectations were set fairly low as these were my 11th and 12th transit of DFW on American over the last 6-7 years but wanted to burn off some miles. Of these trips I can now say that 2 have departed on time out of this place. That said my trip down to MEX was uneventful. Food was fair at best and F/A's smiles seemed missing but was on time. The departure out of MEX back to Dallas was delayed by Radar problems at MEX. This set off a chain of events that resulted in a missed connection at DFW and while 90% could be attributed to the Radar problem. The flight was not posted on airport monitors and the gate was changed. The departure gate did not have the flight displayed so people had to ask if this was indeed for the DFW flight. Once on board the pilot announced a 59 minute traffic delay due to an early full ground stop. That 59 minutes went by plus another 20 or so with no further word from the crew. Late passengers arrived about an hour after the scheduled time and once loaded the door was shut and we pushed back. Since I signed up for Emails I received no fewer than 14 Emails that I didn't read until arrival in DFW which caused connection confusion that even one of their agents could not explain. As it turned out due to carry on bag only I could have made my first flight but apparently they gave my seat away thinking there would be no way I could make it. Coming into DFW I checked online and it showed what looked like I had been rebooked on the 2nd of 2 remaining flights but Emails after arrival which were generic made me think I had been rebooked on the first of the two. All 3 remaining flights were at different terminals which didn't help. Food offered on both return legs was ridiculous same thing on both flights which means they boarded the little biscuit sandwiches at DFW flew them to MEX to serve on the return flight.,4american-airlines,18/02/15,Flew PHL-AMS return on 757-200 in January 2015. No frills single aisle plane was on time and food was fine - one glass of wine free. I brought my own iPad full of movies because of the lack of AVOID. No person sat beside me so plenty of room. Staff was efficient but they need to fix a loose door in the loo (was broken on the outbound and return flights no excuse).,8american-airlines,18/02/15,Travelling from Bogota to London via Miami we lost our connecting flight at Miami Airport due to delay of our first flight with American Airlines. We waited 5 hrs in a long queue with other passengers that have also lost connecting flights with AA. AA staff was really impolite. Their only offer was to travel to Dallas next day and from there to London. They didn't offer accommodation and we stayed all night at Miami Airport (12 hours) We finally reached London 24 hrs after our initially scheduled time. They didn't offer any kind of compensation. Never travel again with AA.,1american-airlines,11/02/15,JFK-Bermuda-JFK. Flight to Bermuda uneventful though only soft drinks served despite being an International flight at dinner hour nary a peanut to be seen. Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.,1american-airlines,11/02/15,AA0071 1/12/2015 FRA-DFW. Actually my flight was with Etihad however the connection from Frankfurt to Dallas Fort Worth was with American Airlines. The plane outside looked great however once I boarded it looked like I was still in the 1960's. Damaged/not working light switches ugly and dirty seats and the 12 hour long flight had no monitor to watch anything. I will try to avoid American Airlines in future.,1american-airlines,06/02/15,AA86 on Jan 22: ORD-LHR 767-300. Used Flagship Lounge before boarding - always great service there and one of the ladies always remembers me with a hello and chat. Boarding was quick - seat 6G and Business Class was full. Coach was around 70% full. Greeted by attendant on boarding and once at my seat attendant came and took my jacket and offered water/champagne/OJ. Took off on time and post-take off drinks were served with nuts. Dinner was halibut that was excellent and the F/A's were very attentive. Bose headsets always great and Samsung tablet had sufficient shows to watch. Slept 4 1/2 hours and asked for breakfast - was brought right away. Circled a couple times and landed at Terminal 3 - off the plane quickly and transferred to T5 for flight to Brussels. Really think AA is doing great - hope it continues.,9american-airlines,06/02/15,On 1/18 flew from Omaha to DFW to New Orleans. Flight very uneventful. Even arrived in Dallas early and had to wait for another plane to pull out so we had a gate to pull up to. Made the connection to New Orleans easily and the flight was on time. On 1/25 flew from New Orleans to DFW to Omaha. Flight was on time until we boarded in Dallas and wait to wait nearly an hour so light bulbs on the wing could be replaced. Since I don't fly much I was satisfied that the flights for the most part were on time and uneventful.,7american-airlines,06/02/15,GRB to HNL via ORD and DFW. Five of 6 segments were on time or up to 30 minutes early. Ground and cabin staff were personable passed beverages 4 times on long-haul outbound but service was very lean on return (no coffee on a flight arriving at 5 am). Cabins clean seats adequately cushioned but a tight fit as expected. The entree salad I purchased was tasty and priced fairly. Entertainment is really inadequate on B767-300 with overhead video and no music channels at all on return. Unfortunately American Eagle is really a hot mess except for nice cabin staff. On final segment five schedule changes were sent to my phone in a 30 minute period-30 minute delay no just 5 minutes back to 30 minutes etc. The final message indicated just a 5 minute delay but after we boarded we sat on the plane for another 50 minutes while they located a new captain anyway. In my experience if you must use American Eagle shoot for the first flight of the day.,6american-airlines,06/02/15,We used American for the first and last time 1/5/14 for a flight to Cabo (flight 1087). We had a transfer in Chicago that's where the nightmare began. We arrived 15 minutes early but had to wait for almost 1.5 hrs to get off the plane. The pilot said the gate was not clear yet because we were early then they were de-icing then the baggage handlers then crew problems. Our connecting flight was delayed an hour so we would just make it. The flight was scheduled for 10 am delayed until 11 but no gate given then 12 then 2 then 3 then 4 then 5 then 6. We found out sometime after 2 that the plane was in Seattle. They never offered an apology although they did give us 12 dollar meal vouchers. We got 2 sandwiches and had to pay for our sodas. We were scheduled to be in Cabo at noon that day but did not get there until 10pm. A day of our vacation was lost 9 hours of aggravation and never offered any compensation for this terrible service. Just a quick comparison we went to Cancun in November on Southwest airlines they had a problem processing our boarding passes 20 minute delay we were afraid we were not going to be able to go but they got the problem fixed. If you have a choice for flights choose a company that cares.,1american-airlines,06/02/15,"In spite of the fact that we booked and paid for a $4K vacation a month before the actual travel AA wouldn't assign my husband and I actual seats. This meant we couldn't print out boarding passes before getting to the airport. However if we were willing to pay extra $ they would give us seat assignments. In coach. They were basically holding the seats hostage unless we paid a ransom to free them. When I enquired w/ AA as to why they actually said that our $4K payment gave us the ""service"" of flight/flying not the actual seat. They also said seat assignments were handled by the gate. An out and out lie since an extra $60 or more would have gotten us seat assignments on the spot.",1american-airlines,28/01/15,JFK-DFW-GRU-JFK. First leg on a brand-new 737 seats were comfortable and flight attendants were friendly. They went above and beyond looking for an item that I lost during the flight checking the seat cushions and pockets and profusely apologizing when they couldn't find it. Next leg on the 777-300ER. Seats were once again comfortable although legroom was a bit tight but was not much of an issue since I had the entire row to myself. Recline was excellent although it was a little too much that when the person in front of me reclined there was very limited space. Flight attendants on this flight were once again very friendly and professional. Catering was excellent both quantity and quality. Return flight to JFK on a 777-300ER again. This time seated in Main Cabin Extra. Legroom and recline was great there were plenty of space to move around. Flight attendants and catering were once again excellent dinner was one of the best meals I had on a plane. Service on this flight was very attentive. So Kudos to AA! The only issue was the IFE had to be rebooted a couple of times other than that the system offers a lot of variety and options. Overall as a loyal United customer I was pretty impressed with AA! Service was warm and friendly and the 777-300ER product is reliable and comfortable.,9american-airlines,28/01/15,"Flew from Seattle to Santiago via Miami. The flight to Miami was uneventful on a 737. The flight to Santiago left much to be desired on an antique 767. Seats were uncomfortable and stained. The meal was bland and unappetizing to look at - made the mistake of having the chicken. The old school ""entertainment"" system was a throwback to the 70's and the movie was only available in Spanish. It was a moot point though as I could not see the 12"" screen from a dozen seats away anyhow. The return flight was canceled. We were rebooked the next day on a 777 which was a welcome change. Unfortunately this plane was filthy and the FAs were quite rude. To cap it off as we were boarding we were stopped on the jetway and told that AA has a no outside drinks policy so we would have to throw out the bottles of water we bought airside before boarding our 10 hour flight. On the plane I timed it and after the original thimble of water it took 5 hours to get another one. I learned my lesson and AA will not get my business again.",3american-airlines,28/01/15,Flight 1021 on January 24 from Granada to Miami. This was a terribly crowded and hot plane. Flight duration was about 3 hrs 45 mins. The flight attendants made a single pass through the cabin to offer drink service and pick up cups which took no more than an hour and a half. After this they were not seen for the last 2 hrs 15 mins of the flight. I found three flight attendants seated at the rear of the plane. I have never had worse inflight service and had never seen a more lazy group of flight attendants.,1american-airlines,26/01/15,London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) via Chicago (ORD) in First. Bag drop at LHR was easy. Flagship lounge a little antiseptic but welcoming enough. Boarding straightforward. Plane on the transatlantic section looked a little tired inside but the seat was enormous and very comfortable. Food and drinks very good and service outstanding. If I have a gripe it's that the IFE wasn't great and the TV of poor quality. Domestic leg was OK but I wouldn't expect the same class of treatment on such a flight.,9american-airlines,26/01/15,Booked flight and hotel with Travelbag and was horrified to discover that I was flying with AA! We flew economy from Heathrow to Miami Miami to San Jose. Check-in was good and we got good exit row seats on the first flight. Second flight we got bad seats and rude staff. Return journey again we got good exit row seats but had more bad staff does AA specialise in them? Not as bad as I thought but due to rude staff I won't be rushing to fly with them again.,5american-airlines,26/01/15,"Flight 287. Our Flight was supposed to be non-stop from Miami to LA. Plane developed a problem as we sat waiting to leave the terminal. It took 2 hours to determine it was not fixable. We were compensated with headsets and two granola bars while we waited for the news that American Airlines was trying to find another plane. No plane was available so we deplaned and waited another hour in the terminal for the decision to fly to Phoenix where we could refuel on the same plane and go on to LA. By now the flight is 4 hours late leaving. Arriving in Phoenix the captain said ""Good news is we are in Phoenix the bad news is the crew has to stand down due to FAA regulations."" Another delay - All the passengers were shuttled around to other flights. It's late we are all exhausted and had been lead along by a string of lies. We missed our connecting flight by 6 hours and had to stay in LA. Two granola bars and a pair of headsets. One lie leads to another creating distress for the passengers and the consequent employees that had to deal with the avalanche that resulted from a full-flight of unhappy flyers. It was a nightmare. I will never fly American again.",1american-airlines,23/01/15,DFW to Milan Italy via JFK in December 2014. On check in for this flight at DFW the agent informs us the flight is over sold in economy so we inquire about being switched to British Airways on the non-stop to LHR then on-wards to Milan. The AA Agent looks puzzled and quickly said we cannot switch you to BA. At this point we are confused as AA/BA have a tie up we know for a fact Delta can put you on Air France if the flight is over sold. So then we head to JFK with the domestic leg good on a new plane. At the AA terminal 8 at JFK we come to find out the AA lounge coupons given to use are no good but the AA Agent in the lounge makes an exception for the lounge since Christmas is around the corner. Finally we board the AA flight to Milan. Since we own the AA credit card we are allowed to board with Zone 2 but the red jacket agent stops us saying your AA Credit Card is useless and does not work for zone 2. Finally get on the flight and the flight leaves on time. Meals and service were good as AA has to compete with Emirates on this sector but AA really lacks any economy class in flight entertainment. There are no personal TV screens in each seat like Emirates offers. The seats in economy class are too small on AA. Since AA has put TV screens every few rows no one can sleep on this flight as the lighting from the TV screens is very annoying. To end the flight the Breakfast was very good in economy. Overall if AA would match Emirates with proper in flight offering in economy class they would have a good product but till they do this one is better offer taking Emirates if flying to Milan in Economy class.,5american-airlines,23/01/15,I have 2 children. One is 8 month and the other one 2.5 years. They don't give priority to board the plane to families with babies nor seniors. Secondly the staff who help you when you are checking in are useless. When you get to the airport you have to check in using their computers but if you are traveling with infants you have to line up for more than an hour. When we lined up an AA employee approached us and confirmed that we were in the right line. One hour later the staff member who was about to help us check in said that we were in the wrong line. Once at the gate they didn't give preference to families with babies. Somebody said through the speaker that there wasn't enough room for our carry-ons and that we had to check them in at no cost. When we approached the staff member at the front desk guy to ask him where to leave the carry on he ignored us. Lastly this airline charges you extra for your luggage. Our ticket was very expensive and on top of that we had to pay extra for our baggage. This is the first and last time that I travel with them.,1american-airlines,21/01/15,I try to avoid them whenever I can but as a student I have to go for the cheapest so I gave them another try from Miami to Milan. First of all no private screens on a 9 hour journey should be banned. Although I did sleep most of the time I would have liked to listen to some music or watch a movie of my choice not chosen by them. Besides that the aircraft didn't seem very well kept and the food was just bad. To make the matter worse the plane was delayed by 6 hours and they kept changing our gate telling the plane was broken. Would try to avoid them if you can.,4american-airlines,21/01/15,LHR-LAX flight in business class: new 777 aircraft. Excellent flight very attentive crew (best ever on AA) good IFE and WiFi which was a great treat - $19 for a 10 hr flight is not unreasonable but you would perhaps expect to be free of charge for First and Business Class travelers? SFO-ORD-LHR: flights in Main Cabin Extra. The usual 737 for the internal flight which was fine. Again attentive staff. The leg from ORD to LHR was on a very old and dated 767 which you really no longer would expect to exist in a company from a 1st world country? IFE broke down so everyone had to make do with their own entertainment options. Cabin crew were excellent again. I fell asleep as we took off and missed my meal when I woke up I was offered it within 10-15 minutes. I have had a fair few flights with American in the past to the US and because my partner has Executive Platinum status with them we always do tend to get upgrades to business class but have never thought much of the service so far. Clearly American is staff is making an effort! The quality of service has really improved.,8american-airlines,21/01/15,"Why is there always some ""breakdown"" with American? I live in Alexandria LA and only have three choices and unfortunately I am forced to fly AA. Normally only 1 out of 4 flight go without some type problem. Always late or delayed. Flight Crew doesn't show up. Gates are changed sometimes up to 5 times. And lost bags are the norm. Why can't AA get their game together?",1american-airlines,19/01/15,In the air American was decent. We flew TUS-DFW-BNA and EVV-ORD-TUS and found the flight crew to be friendly and helpful for the most part. The issues we had were with customer service on the ground particularly in Dallas where our missed flight did not result in any support for our troubles. They also lost our luggage but they apologized and compensated us appropriately sending a check in a very timely manner. The MD-80s they fly are fine but the fact that I flew in a plane 5 years younger than me doesn't do much for my faith in the company. American Eagle's ERJs are horrible for anyone over 5 feet tall and they feel dated. The newer 737s were nice however.,3american-airlines,19/01/15,Nov 10th AA2216. AA2463 Nov 11th. Our flight from LA to SYD was QF12 on Nov 11 2014. I would like to give American Airlines a poor review on their performance and customer service we experienced on a flight to Sydney Australia in November 2014. Our flight was delayed leaving MSP partially due to weather but really because they left us sitting on the plane while they delayed the de-icing and then took 45 minutes to do something the pilot said usually takes 15 minutes. We missed our connecting flight in DFW that was to take us to Sydney and the ticket attendants there absolutely refused to re-route us onto several flights that could have taken us to LAX to connect to a flight to SYD that same night. They instead put us on a flight the next day that would re-route us through LAX and on to SYD making us lose an entire day in Australia. The ticket attendants were rude and inconsiderate. I have never had such poor customer service in all my years of flying. DFW said it is a policy not to allow someone on a flight through stand-by if their end destination is international. American Airlines said each airport has their own policy on that and it is not a standard AA policy. There were several flights that went from DFW to LAX that evening and they allowed over 30 people to board those planes on stand-by but would not allow us to.,2american-airlines,19/01/15,JFK-SFO-LAX-LAS-JFK with American Airlines were the worst four flights of my life! Ground staff and cabin crew were rude and inefficient. The cabin and seats were very old and worn out. Not a single crew member on any four of the flights I took even bothered to say hello or welcome or even smile. Obviously we had to purchase snacks onboard because AA does not offer food. The snack options were very limited and if you were seated at the very back of the economy cabin you will never be guaranteed whether you will get the snacks you wanted to buy because they only stock few onboard and they get sold out half way through. Even during the selling of snacks and drinks the cabin crew looked very displeased that they had to do it. The cabin crew were extremely badly groomed. The economy seat had hardly any legroom. If you are a tall person you will have a hard time moving in your seat because it is so small with no legroom. We even bought extra legroom seats and still there was not enough legroom. All four flights were delayed and took off hours late. We were boarded late and then had to sit in the aircraft for at least 1 to 2 hours before take off. As a result our plans had to be cancelled and changed. I will never fly with AA again.,american-airlines,19/01/15,I flew from LHR-MIA in Business on one of their new 777-300. I cant fault this flight. The seats in Business have lots of space places for storage and good size IFE screens. IFE itself is also good. Food was of a good quality. Service was very good from the crew who were pleasant friendly and were happy to keep your drink topped up. If you're feeling peckish during the flight the galley is stocked with snacks where you can help yourself. Overall a very pleasant on time flight. In contrast I flew the return with BA on a very worn 747 business class cabin is badly designed and crew not very friendly at all. If you are doing this route definitely choose AA over BA miles better product!,10american-airlines,19/01/15,I have never seen anything like I saw today at MIA. We arrived an hour and a half before my son's domestic flight and could not believe the chaos at American's ticket counters. There were long lines at every kiosk and even longer lines at the checked bag line. After finally checking in at a kiosk my son could not print his boarding pass because the machine had run out of paper. I had been standing in the checked bag line and when we approached the employee and explained that we had a luggage tag but the boarding pass had not printed she directed us to another line that had easily more than 60 people! I then approached another American Airlines employee and asked for assistance and she was incredibly rude and offered no help. Fortunately we were able to get my son's boarding pass on the phone. Despite a ridiculous security check-in line he was able to board his flight on time. A friend of his that was on the same flight had to forcefully argue with other employees to get on the flight because they said they had closed the gate and would not let him board even though he was checked in!,1american-airlines,19/01/15,Last January 13th I took my flight back from Madrid Spain to JFK AA 095 we started our flight two hours late not being informed about time or anything similar we were not allowed to leave the area inside the airport where our plane was and if we wanted they said that they would open our carry-on bags totally. We boarded and when we were boarding they informed us that we had a stop in Goose bay Canada to have gas otherwise we would not be able to get to New York the stop was 1h 30m long. We arrive in JFK so late that almost everybody lost their connection. However we were given new connections once we got out of the plane. But they did not give us any voucher or anything in compensation for this horrible flight. I would try not to fly American Airlines again.,1american-airlines,19/01/15,Flight Miami to LHR 13/01. Technically the flight was good early arrival very soft touchdown and excellent information from flight deck. However the cabin service left a lot to be desired. The crew were very unhelpful and the food poor by the standards of comparable airlines. Our return trip to the UK (operated by AA) was far inferior to our outward trip to Boston operated by BA. Given the choice at a comparable price level I would not fly with AA again.,1american-airlines,19/01/15,Itinerary: Chicago - Miami - Campinas Brasil. Flight from MIA to VRP was canceled because the AA crew did not show up. Service crew for the make-up flight were very nice and accommodating but the AA staff at MIA were not very friendly at all and we had to search for them after seeing our flight was canceled. On all legs the planes were AA and not very clean at all. Overall I lost a couple days traveling and when I arrived I felt dirtier than when I have flown better international carriers not to mention no personalized inflight entertainment or WiFi. Two thumbs down for international AA.,2american-airlines,19/01/15,"I recently flew from Brazil to Los Angeles on American Airlines and it was the longest most uncomfortable international flight I have ever been on. In addition to the dirty looking and old interior the broken flush button on the toilet and the only semi-functioning ""entertainment"" device the staff were rude and had horrible attitudes. One flight attendant actually rolled her eyes at me when I asked for headphones. Her response was ""Don't you have an iPod or something that you have headphones for"". When I said no she rolled her eyes and said she would see if they had any but everyone brings their own headphones now. The food was horrible as well. It was the most unpleasant flying experience I have ever had. I will avoid flying American Airlines at all costs in the future.",1american-airlines,19/01/15,New York to San Francisco 20 Dec 2014 AA179. San Francisco to Los Angeles 25 Dec 2014 AA2378. Los Angeles to Las Vegas 30 Dec 2014 AA182. Las Vegas to New York 4 Jan 2015 AA120. My partner and I were extremely disappointed with everything. All 4 flights were delayed not by few minutes but by hours. Later the staff would board all passengers on to the aircraft and in all the flights we would just sit on the tarmac for hours. Usually when you board the plane the CSD or the purser of the flight would greet you with a friendly smile and say welcome aboard or good morning etc. But in all the flights with AA they could not care less about passengers. Flight attendants were too busy talking to each other or. The grooming of the flight attendants was atrocious! Above all the flight attendants on all 4 flights were very rude and arrogant. They don't even bother to look or smile or talk politely with the passengers when they are boarding the flight. The seats in economy was so uncomfortable with minimal leg room. There is no comfort. It is okay for short flights but not very good for long flights like New York to San Francisco or Las Vegas to New York. We paid extra for extra legroom economy seats. Well AA should learn what extra legroom means. There was no extra legroom. The seats are terrible for tall people. I will never recommend AA.,1american-airlines,19/01/15,LAX-SLC on 18 July 2014 SLC-RDU on 25 July 2014 RDU-JFK on 28 July 2014. Typical AA flights and lounges- pretty ordinary. Not a patch on Qantas or BA. Ground staff at RDU did not recognise or acknowledge an international RTW J class ticket - denied baggage allowance. Had to pay $25 to check 1 bag. Why don't AA enforce carry-on bag rules? Many passengers with 3 or more overweight bags. Would we recommend AA to family & friends? Probably as they are 'less bad' than the opposition.,6american-airlines,19/01/15,SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.,5american-airlines,19/01/15,"Traveled three times round trip LAX to LHR in the last 4 months of 2014: flights 136 and 135. Equipment - 777 300ER (I go out of my way to fly this plane as it is the newest and most comfortable). Business Class. Seats J12 J13 and J14 (window seats). I can't say enough good things about the seat (private and roomy flat bed) the inflight entertainment (15"" screen) and the noise-canceling headphones (sized large enough to surround the ear rather than mashing it as do the headphones on BA). In all instances the food from LAX to LHR was not good and certainly not worth the calories (the same can be said for BA). Better to eat in the Admirals Club Lounge (more on this later). The food from LHR to LAX was much better and excellent on one flight (must have a better kitchen at LHR). The LAX Admirals Lounge is comfortable enough but it is unconscionable that long-haul business class passengers are required to pay for everything beyond bar snacks and coffee. I have never paid for food in the business class lounge of any other comparably-sized airline. And we were mislead (cheated) by one of the wait staff. As an aside BA shares the Admirals Club Lounge in San Diego and as a BA passenger I wasn't charged for food in the lounge there. The LHR Admirals Club Lounge is certainly spartan but well-tended and thankfully much less crowded than the BA lounge. In fact the AA lounge was just about empty on my three visits. Yes the food in the AA lounge is limited compared to BA but at least you don't have to pay extra for it as you do in all of the Admirals Clubs in the USA. Check-in was spotty at best and miserable at worst. At LHR we had to use the check-in desk for coach passengers because there was only one business class desk in operation. I would recommend AA but only for passengers flying business class in the 777 300ER aircraft.",8american-airlines,15/01/15,I just flew on a Milan-Miami route with AA and thought the interior was extremely run down and dirty. No personal TV's poor choice of 2 films for a 10 hour flight cheap headsets dirty and broken toilets and disgusting food. My kids flew over thanksgiving one from Dallas to Madrid and another from JFK to Milan and the plane conditions were the same. Will never fly again AA on International flights!,1american-airlines,14/01/15,"NRT/ORD 777-300 I hesitated booking F/class on AA even with award travel because of their flight attendants' general culture of hostility towards passengers but I reasoned I'd be asleep for much of the flight. We sat on the tarmac for 45 minutes before taking off. When returning to my seat from the lavatory after we'd finally reached cruising altitude a flight attendant looked at me coldly and barked ""Put your seat belt on!"". There was some turbulence but this was not the way to handle it. The purser was friendly and efficient but he referred to my husband as ""Mr.---- "" and called me ""Dear"". The new seats were very comfortable though and I liked that my husband and I could spin the seats to face each other while dining (although the food was surprisingly bad). I slept well on the comfortable flat bed. If the food and service were comparable to the seat it would have been a great flight. Until then I'll continue to book transpacific premium travel on Asian carriers.",5american-airlines,14/01/15,"I dread flying with American Airlines but with their association with British Airways (Who are fantastic) I have to for internal American Flights. Last flight was from Boston to New York with an onward BA connection to London. Arrived at Boston airport for check in very rude AA check in attendant who was unhelpful and just plain miserable. Onwards to the departure gate screens indicated a 25 minute delay. Was not too concerned as had around 4 hours to connect onto BA flight once landed in JFK. We then spent 2.5 hours waiting at the gate with hardly any communication from AA staff apart from ""Its a weather delay"" turns out it was due to a faulty aircraft door. Anyway the four hour connection time was fast approaching and people were starting to become annoyed and very irritated. Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served. I have honestly never been on an AA flight whereby the crew are smiling happy to serve you and are actually grateful for you flying with them and I have taken around 8 AA flights including across the pond the attitude at times is appalling. On the same holiday I was on a delayed Delta flight from Atlanta to Boston and the difference between staff was unbelievable was even given a free beer and sincere apology for the delay and more importantly was kept informed and the crew were cheerful and happy. AA manners cost nothing!",2american-airlines,14/01/15,"I am a long time traveler and loyal to American Airlines however whoever designed these ""new"" planes must have been 2 feet tall. The design is terrible. I am a slim 5'10"" and sat in a ""premium"" economy seat from Washington DC/LA on a nearly 6 hour flight. I sat next to two other tall people making it even more unpleasant. I will start with the good American has finally come into the 21st century and provides individual screens for in flight entertainment but still not nearly as good as Virgin America which also offers many free viewing options TV etc. Chargers USB are improved as well. Now the bad - the leg room and more so the seat/tray table configuration (even in premium) is appalling and even worse if the person in front of you reclines their seat which is highly likely. In my case they did and my drink ended up in my lap. If the seat in front is reclined you are pretty much trapped. The head rest ""wings"" that allow you to rest your head from side to side are so small anyone with a normal size head could not possibly use. They are ridiculous. The seat pocket basically holds nothing forget stocking up on magazines and books for your long flight as you will be carrying them in your lap or chucking them on the floor. Though it's nice to fly in a nicer and newer plane it is just shocking that no consideration was given to traveler comfort on these new planes especially if you are a over 5'2"". Not sure how the American or Boeing CEOs didn't catch this. They must have only tested out first class or they are all really short!",2american-airlines,14/01/15,AA174 (Raleigh RDU-London LHR) on Dec 23 2014. We initially boarded the old rust bucket that is the 767-300 only to be disembarked a couple of hours later due to mechanical problems. They told us mechanics would have the problem fixed in 2 hours only for the inevitable announcement 3 hours later that they couldn't fix the plane and that we would depart the next morning. AA did provide hotels overnight but it was another 2 hour ordeal with 250 passengers lining up to see ONE representative. The next morning we all made our way to the gate boarded the same plane which the captain announced had been fixed and tested and waited for departure. Only we never departed. One hour later the captain announced the plane was STILL not fit to fly to the annoyance of us passengers. We had to wait a further 7 hours at the airport for another AA rust bucket 767 to come save us from London. After a 24 hour delay and 3 separate boardings for 1 flight we finally made it to London Christmas morning. My return flight (AA105) from London LHR to New York JFK operated on a brand new 777-300 was of course flawless. Lesson learned and tip: Do everything you can to avoid flying the 767 because chances are you won't be flying. They were good planes back in the 90's and 00's but they're unreliable these days. Moreover if you want entertainment and comfort avoid 767s at all costs. Ultimately AA is a good airline if you fly the right planes.,5american-airlines,11/01/15,"Dec 10 & 15 Economy flights - DCA to LAX & back. To LAX we were forced to sit row 11 even after we reserved ""main cabin upgrade"". Crew member informed us that the aircraft was switched. Then on the way back from LAX to DCA Dec 15 after paying extra for the upgrade ($81 for my husband's 11D & $78 for my 11E - Boarding Group 1 already included) I had to pay on top of that $15 each for Group 1 boarding - the website just did not allow me to proceed with on-line check in! Our multiple calls to Customer Service/their response were really unacceptable! E- mailed the AA Senior Leadership no courtesy response at all. Never again.",1american-airlines,11/01/15,January 1st Denver to Dallas Dallas to Wichita Falls. 5 hour delay in Dallas then canceled our flight. Told us no flights until Sunday/Monday refused to pay for food hotel rental and wouldn't give us our luggage. Ended up paying for my own hotel and splitting a rental with 3 other passengers. Luggage still in Dallas with no eta to get to me. 3 different calls to make a claim on luggage all three have said different information messed up my address each time and can't tell me why it wasn't delivered on next flight. Zero customer service. I will never fly AA again. I'll drive to Dallas and pay 3x as much to park my car to fly with anyone else.,1american-airlines,11/01/15,On flight from Austin TX to Manchester UK on 12/21/14 - paid for the additional leg room which could be better but was ok however the seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever. The more leg room you get the narrower the seat gets! 8 hrs in a cramped seat is ridiculous. My husband and I had seats 15a & b and left the armrest up between us to give us room for our arms the passenger in seat c I am thankful to say did the same thing. Seriously removing rows of seats to gain additional leg room is one thing but reducing seat widths to cram in more seats is in my opinion the most ridiculous idea they ever had. The staff were not the best and a little on the rude side. I have flown AA every time I had flown to the UK but I am considering a different airline for future trips due to the seats mainly. The captain did a great job - the entire flight was smooth.,3american-airlines,11/01/15,I had to book a flight from Orlando to Manchester UK the day after Christmas for a family emergency so naturally looked for the most affordable flight which by a few dollars was AA also taking into account flight times. I have flown this route with many other airlines in the past and AA was by far my worst experience. Flight left 40 mins late but did make up the time with a tail wind so we arrived on time. Some of the cabin crew were downright surly others were very pleasant. As I can't sleep on planes I rely on watching movies to pass the time but with no in-seat screens there was nothing to watch. I will never fly AA again even if it saves me money.,1american-airlines,11/01/15,"We travel by AA to New York every Christmas and always enjoy the journey. We travel economy class therefore no frills nevertheless it's good value the staff are kind and the food and drinks are perfectly acceptable. This year our return journey was postponed due to illness and I would like to say a huge ""thank you"" to AA for their efforts to get us back to the UK. Assistance was arranged at JFK and LHR without which we could not have managed. Excellent service and greatly appreciated.",8american-airlines,11/01/15,Flight AA900 EZE-MIA I traveled with my husband and we had window and alley seats but they are so very uncomfortable the leg space is almost non existent. The arm rests are very weird because that is where the entertainment control is so you put your arm on the control and it sets of constantly.,1american-airlines,11/01/15,My family and I traveled down from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Los Cabos (SJD) and back for winter break. The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster. We were delayed about 1 hour but managed to get to ORD ahead of schedule.,3american-airlines,11/01/15,I flew from Montreal to NYC and then form NYC to San Juan (Puerto Rico). Staff extremely nice. Planes on time. But most of all we forgot our camera on the plane and they found it and kept it for us at the luggage claim in the San Juan airport.,9american-airlines,11/01/15,American Airlines seriously needs to reconsider its business plan of overbooking every single flight on one day and how that affects passengers trying to make connections when one flight is late. They also need to train their employees to treat passengers with respect and provide more telephone customer service options that don't leave you waiting 45-51 minutes. My flight was 90 minutes late out of Miami and I therefore missed my connection to San Francisco and apparently every other flight was overbooked for the next 24 hours which is completely insane.,1american-airlines,05/01/15,Flight 3314 supposed to depart 845pm. Six gate changes rude staff. An hour and counting delay while we wait for catering truck. I hate flying American. Will use it only as last resort now.,1american-airlines,05/01/15,I have flown American Airlines over 60 times in 2014 without issue. I must say the customer service is much better than a couple of years ago and now with US Airways part of the family the ability to travel to about any destination you desire is there. I will continue to fly AA and with new planes new look and better customer service I will enjoy doing so.,10american-airlines,05/01/15,Supposed to leave Miami to Milan at 14.30 but delayed twice. In the end we left with 4 hours of delays. The plane was an old fashioned 767-300 seats were small and dirty. Entertainment was overhead screens far from our seats. A real nightmare.,1american-airlines,05/01/15,Flew First Class from Buenos Aires - Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777-200. The seats while dated are roomy with lots of leg room and storage space. Boarding was quick although the agents and gate security at EZE leave a bit to be desired. Our flight attendants were ok nothing remarkable. Food was filling and of fair quality. The seat is lie- angled and not super comfortable but comfy enough to relax and watch the dated IFE. I can't complain about sitting in First Class on this 11 hour flight but the whole experience was just mediocre.,5american-airlines,29/12/14,AA63 CDG to MIA AA931 MIA to EZE AA990 GIG to MIA AA62 MIA to CDG. Worst cabin service unimaginable seats still using the ancient TV screens on ceiling on Trans Atlantic and South American flights! Imagine looking at a small screen on top of the ceiling during a 10 hour flight. They only screen 1 movie on the entire flight.,1american-airlines,29/12/14,Flight from Miami to Phoenix flight 303. First class was a major disappointment from old plane to slowest service ever no pre-flight drinks and then waited over 1 hour before a beverage was served. Sorry to say the New American feels like to old AA famous for poor service. Loyal US Air at least they tried and had a sense of urgency.,2american-airlines,22/12/14,Round-trip from Miami to CDG Paris. Cabin seats with little to no leg space and I'm not a large person. I passed on the food on the return trip as the chicken dish on the trip from Miami to Paris was lukewarm and horrible. In recent years I have seen fares on the international flights rise rapidly and in my opinion they have done little to justify the price increase. In the future I will look for another airline.,2american-airlines,22/12/14,Give credit where credit is due-on the 16th of December I boarded AA193 in First seat 3E to connect in JFK to AA1416 to BDA also in First seat 3E. Due to a technical fault we had about an hour delay in BOS and I was concerned that I (and my fellow connecting passengers) would miss our connections. The captain did his best to make up time and after arriving at the gate (12) the lead flight attendant asked passengers not connecting to remain seated and let passengers with connections to disembark first. My BDA flight was at gate 40 and I made the fligh t- with moments to spare! Upon arriving in BDA was very surprised to see that my 2 bags had also made it. Thanks AA for a good team effort - and please put the dinner service back on that evening flight.,10american-airlines,22/12/14,Flew business SJU-JFK-LHR. SJU-JFK leg on old 757 with no individual video screens and pretty tired cabin. Food was virtually inedible. Admirals Club lounge at JFK OK but I resent having to pay for a packet of crisps when I've paid thousands for a ticket. JFK-LHR was much better: new 777 with really comfy flat bed and amazing noise cancelling headphones. Food was still awful (but food is generally dreadful in the USA anyway so to be expected. Flight slightly late but overall pretty good - particularly like the fact I wasn't woken up until 25 minutes before landing.,6american-airlines,18/12/14,I had about a 10 hr non stop flight from Paris to New York. There was no in seat TV. Only 2-3 TVs in the aisle and they asked for $5 each for headphones to listen to the movies they were playing of their choice. All the flight attendants were rude. I needed a blanket but they denied this. Overall it was a lesson for me to avoid American Airlines flights wherever possible.,1american-airlines,18/12/14,Flying from O'Hare to DC - rude attendant who let several passengers on board with 2 bags some larger than my single carry-on. I had to stow my bag because I had a shopping bag. When I offered to collapse the bag and place it under the seat I was told that I could not carry both onto the plane. Once we boarded the plane we were kept on the ground for 3 hours without water and/or food for those of us unlucky enough to not have brought our own on board. When I asked an attendant if I could have a bottle of water I was told that no service could be provided and to be patient that we would be departing soon (this was about two hours before our flight took off). When the flight eventually took off we were offered options for snacks when I requested my option I was told that they had run out. Why offer an option at all? When the drink cart eventually made its way to me I asked for a coke and was given 1/2 a coke served for me in a cup. When I asked for a second one I was told that they had limited quantities. Outdated plane with the tv screens down the middle row. Horrible service - rude check-in attendants and complete incompetence from the entire crew. I will not fly American Airlines again.,1american-airlines,18/12/14,Four hour fog delay from Midland to DFW. Sat on the Tarmac for a half hour to get to a gate at DFW. Then waited 45 min. on someone to open the door. Return flight was at 6.10pm - delay after delay and finally canceled at 9pm due to weather. Kicker is an AA flight left the same terminal an hour later for Midland. We couldn't schedule another flight to Midland until two days later. Agents were the rudest most disrespectful and uncaring people you would ever want to run across. If you ever desire to travel with AA don't.,1american-airlines,18/12/14,Flight from Chicago to Paris on Thurs (12/5/14) was nothing but miserable. AA brought two planes to the gate when neither could pass safety inspection. The big question is why the planes made it to the gate in the first place. Passengers were then told that another plane had been found (another gate) but it needed to be inspected cleaned and finally loaded - they did provide soda and pretzels during the 3.5+ hour wait (big deal). We finally boarded a not-too-clean plane (I found trash in the seat pocket) and it was cold for the entire trip. We saw the staff twice - once to serve what they call dinner and once when they served a cold breakfast. The trip was just plain awful and makes me want to give up travel by air altogether. One bright spot that has nothing to do with AA - it was a SMOOTH flight and we made it in record time due to a good tail wind.,1american-airlines,18/12/14,Travelled Business Class on a 777 LHR-JFK. Very impressed indeed! Cabin spotless crew helpful. Seat wider than expected and quite private. Huge amount of space and loads of storage places too - even a large wardrobe. Power points convenient (UK and US plugs both fitted). Good noise cancelling headphones. Quiet. I was in 3A which is a mini-cabin just behind First Class - I would recommend it again. AA Business class is better than BA First Class Wifi: speeds of 3-7Mb which was commendable and only Â£9 approx. for the whole flight - very reasonable too considering the technology costs involved. Food: ok but not special. However snack bar had loads of nice nibbles.,10american-airlines,18/12/14,AUS-DFW-LGA. First leg on a MD-80 old aircraft but very well maintained. Plane was spotless and the seats were comfortable especially the very plush headrest. Legroom was sufficient and flight attendants managed to a conduct a beverage service on a full flight despite a flight time of only 39 minutes. Connection at DFW was seamless. Flight to LGA on a 737-800 had the seat next to me empty which provided a more comfortable flight. Flight attendants were very young which was surprising. They were friendly and cheerful which is a nice change. Refreshments and entertainment were basic and WiFi was extremely slow. Was disappointed that I shelled out money for a slow connection that only started to speed up during descent.,8american-airlines,10/12/14,One way trip First Class from SFO-LAS via LAX.. First sector SFO-LAX excellent service crew couldn't do enough on this short flight. LAX-LAS complete opposite. Shame passengers had to hear how unhappy the crew were about their job.,5american-airlines,10/12/14,Scheduled to leave from Sacramento CA at 8am on 11/24/14. I got an automated call Sunday evening at around 11.30pm stating that my flight out of Sacramento would be delayed until 9:37AM. I was fine with this - I realize delays happen. I still arrived at the airport as if my flight were to leave at it's original 8am departure just in case. When I arrived at the American Airlines counter the women working there proceeded to tell me that because of this delay there would be no way for me to make my connection in Dallas to Montgomery. She made me feel confident that I would indeed miss my connection in Dallas. She said she had changed my flight connection in Dallas to an 9pm departure instead of the original 3.15pm flight out to Montgomery. I wasn't thrilled that I would be arriving much later but it would work. The flight from Sacramento arrived in Dallas at 2:45PM. I had thirty minutes to make my original flight. I made it with a couple minutes to spare. The women at the counter looked up my name and said I could no longer get onto this flight because my flight itinerary had been changed. I then was stuck in Dallas Airport for over 6 hours. AA staff I had talked to about my situation had any sympathy for the situation which made me even more angry. It was nothing but a speed bump into their work day. I would never recommend flying with American Airlines.,2american-airlines,04/12/14,"ATL - DFW flight operated on A319 aircraft. I found this flight to be comfortable (I am 5""4) and efficient. Despite the aircraft arriving 20 min later than scheduled boarding time in Atlanta flight was able to depart close to on time. Flight arrived DFW 10 min early. Cabin crew was pleasant but not overly friendly. All in all a good flight. Flight duration is only 2 hrs so not much time for entertainment and food. I would highly recommend AA domestic U.S. Flights operated on Airbus A319 aircraft vs. outdated and uncomfortable MD 80's.",10american-airlines,04/12/14,Manchester to New York. Their standards are poor even from arriving at the boarding gate - why split passengers into groups and then not pay attention to how those groups board the plane? Surely after business class and those with priority shouldn't the next set of passengers to board the plane be those at the rear. That process would help to ensure the plane left on time rather than almost 20 minutes late. Their fleet is old-fashioned with screens down the centre aisle which cannot be viewed from certain seats. The seats were uncomfortable - 8 hours spent in one of those is not a pleasant experience. We gained the impression that the crew and their requirements over-rode passenger considerations - clearing away too quickly before passengers had time to finish the poor quality meals having to be quiet whilst in the vicinity of sleeping staff and very few drinks/snacks being offered is not what long haul flights should be about. Even the crew's uniform was shabby.,1american-airlines,04/12/14,Terrible service for the money that you pay. We flew from Manchester to New York direct the inbound flight took 9 hours seats where uncomfortable they only had televisions in the aisle - no PTV and no headphones provided. Served food half an hour into the flight then left for 7 hours without anybody asking us if we needed a drink - received a smaller snack 40 mins before landing which made you feel you had to rush as they where already standing waiting for the rubbish before you had finished. The staff were unfriendly and rude. The flight home was exactly the same and to get a drink you had to walk to the back of the plane and ask yourself with more than one occasion being told they had ran out.,1american-airlines,01/12/14,Nov 22 AA 1520 El Salvador to Miami. AA 2487 Miami to Orlando. Will never use this airline again. Connecting flights at Miami are the worst specially international flights. They schedule connecting flights within an hour and a half apart yet they land every international flight at terminal D in Miami 5-10 mins apart. On top of all this their outbound flights are late and incoming planes have to wait to have a new gate. What is the issue with this immigration and customs are 1 hour behind making it difficult to connect. You would think the airline can have someone trying to help you get through or guide you to reconnect to another flight well that is not the case. They take their time and don't care about you.,2american-airlines,01/12/14,Flew from LAX to DFW DFW to Raleigh and Raleigh to LAX in August/Sept 2014. Was waiting for a bad experience based upon many reviews here but we were very happy to see all the flights were on time reasonable staff not too bad service and planes were in reasonable condition as well.,8american-airlines,01/12/14,"I flew DFW-LHR-DFW on AA50 and AA51. Both sectors were on a 777-300er. This is an excellent aircraft. Very spacious quiet and comfortable. AA's business class is by far the best product across the Atlantic. (Make sure that you book on the 77W. If you don't you will get the inferior 777-200 and it really isn't as good as the 300er). The fact that there is only one seat for rows A and J means that you have two windows plenty of space and lots of privacy. The lie flat bed is comfortable and easy to operate. The IFE has plenty of movies TV shows and plenty to keep you entertained. The food is very good with good choices. The walk up kitchen is kept well stocked with many tasty things. You will not go hungry on this flight! The crews were great and of course the flight deck were professional and got us to our destination safely which is always a good thing! The on board wi-fi is fantastic but please don't be a bandwidth bore and use it for ""voice"" calls like the idiot across the aisle from me did all the way to London. He was so annoying I had to complain to the flight crew to get him to shut up. AA have a great product here if they drop the 777-300er on this route as I was told they were going to do it will be a mistake. I will not fly with them. I will have to find another carrier.",9american-airlines,01/12/14,FLL-DFW-LAX upgrade to First. I have to admit the 737-800's are ok but need a refresh. I flew the segment from FLL-DFW it was an upgrade. OK good service. Met service manager for AA sitting next to me. She could not have been nicer. Really pleasant flight. DFW-LAX on the new Airbuses 320-B really great for the length although the seats could recline a bit more considering it is a 3 hour flight and it is hub-hub for AA. Food was OK nothing to write home about but they will upgrade that so look forward to it. No pre-flight welcome drinks - big minus. The seats - great although all leather which is a set back for AA I tend to sweat a lot and I find fabric gives you a bit more breathing. Entertainment - better than British on international flights. Large screens great selections of movies TV this is where AA is getting their game above their competition but they need to keep going. Keep changing the selection more often and staying on top of it alla Emirates. Comparable to the best though. I fly a lot including ANA JL QF BA CX and AA is on par if not above in many. Soft product needs polishing food improvement and it will start being a world-class airline again.,8american-airlines,25/11/14,Multiple North American flights during month including ORD-AUS AUS-DFW DFW-PBI EWR-DFW DFW-YVR YVR-DFW DFW- PBI PBI-LAX. Traveling through the US and Canada during November found me on several AA flights most in first class with upgrades a few in economy. On balance the flights were ok nothing special no notable problems. Most flights were on or close to schedule service was generally better than expected. The biggest negative is AA's equipment on these routes. All B737 or MD Super 80 aircraft. Generally confining for mid-long haul domestic and the S80s are just so old it is a wonder that AA still uses them as much as they do - not a very passenger friendly aircraft.,7american-airlines,25/11/14,I flew with American Airlines on October 20th this year from Dublin to JFK with my husband and two sons 12 and 9. The staff onboard that day were excellent we had the back seats just beside the staff and each one of them could not have made our flight more comfortable. Being our first flight to America and travelling with our youngest son who has autism it was quite a worry but the staff made him and us very comfortable. We are travelling back to the states in 2015 and I will make sure it is with American Airlines.,10american-airlines,20/11/14,What began as a simple flight from San Jose CA to New York NY (JFK) connecting at LAX has resulted in frustration and anger. Upon arriving at San Jose international airport with two hours to spare my fiancÃ© and I each checked a bag. Our flight was projected to leave at 2.45pm PST and read 'On Time' on the departures kiosk. Without any announcement or updates our flight arrived late had to be refuelled and in turn was 30 minutes delayed. We missed our connection at LAX by five minutes and after spending far too much time in the customer service office were rebooked on a 9.30 Delta flight to JFK. Told there was no need to check-in all we would have to do is go to the gate and speak to the representative at the counter. An hour before our flight we walk to the appropriate gate only to be told that while we were listed as passengers there were no seats for us and that American should have booked seats on our behalf. We returned to the customer service office spending an hour waiting in line. An American Airlines rep took us from counter to counter trying to find us two seats on any plane. The only availability was on a place via Nashville to LaGuardia with an hour layover. As we were boarding we were pulled off the plane because he had found us a direct flight to JFK which would make finding our bags that much better. Finally arriving in JFK at 7.15 am our bags were nowhere to be found.,1american-airlines,20/11/14,JFK to Orlando in First. Check-in staff very helpful to our party of 6 after arrival from London. Given access to Admirals Club because long-haul had been business class. Pleasant lounge but only stayed about 20 minutes. Priority boarding and seats comfortable for a medium-length domestic flight. Captain announced that he would delay take-off whilst 35 passengers from a delayed European flight made the transfer and took off when about half that number had boarded. But the real surprise was when the flight attendant came round and said that because of the timing (early afternoon) there was no catering on the flight. Thus a 3-hour flight with just several rounds of a basket containing nuts biscuits and crisps - not a first class offering. Other than that the whole experience was much better (with arrival only slightly delayed) than I had feared given some of the reviews on here.,6american-airlines,17/11/14,Paid for F Class JFK-MCO via MIA. AA's JFK Terminal is beautiful. Dedicated F class check in with arrogant staff agents should be mindful of vocal tones and questions. Premium Security line ended up not being during slow time of day as TSA putting 3 non premium bodies to 1 in the same scanner line even though another was available. I purchased a day pass for the Admirals Club as I was quite early for my flight. The JFK Lounge is very nice service was good staff were very kind especially the lady at reception. Purchased a Fruit and Cheese Plate and was surprised in a happy way. Flt to MIA in a 757 intl config. with angle lie flat 2X2 seated at the window. The seats are awkward to get in/out of when upright impossible to escape a window seat with another either sitting or laying down. I tried the angle lie flat position and lasted less than 30 min. in that position simply uncomfortable might as well stand in the galley. The Lay-z-boy option of recline is very nice. PDB was offered no restrictions. Nice looking IFE pity I was never offered headsets to use it. Cocktails with nuts in a bowl served after take off then dinner. AA seems to have downgraded the nut mix with less premium nuts in the mix. The dinner was the biggest shock. The Pre ordered Lasagne was vile and the salad pathetic. Club in Miami is ok with pleasant staff. MIA-MCO in 757 Dom. config. FA's awful on this leg. Airplane broke after we boarded no one seemed to have a clue what to do next. Gate agents and Admirals Club unable to contact ops via phone for updates. No words. Next plane boarded later than promised with no reason offered. Short Flt to MCO uneventful after 2 plus hour delay. There are some things to improve at AA but there is a lot right.,6american-airlines,17/11/14,"Based upon our experience of American Airlines' flights from the USA to the UK several years ago and to reduce the effects of jet-lag my wife and I decided to take the daytime flight AA90 which departs Chicago (ORD) at 09.05 and arrives in London (LHR) at 22.45. In retrospect this was a mistake. The Chicago Admiral's Club lounge was most disappointing. Surprisingly no food (unless you paid for it) was available except a few sad-looking bagels and muffins. So we were hungry when the flight took off. We were seated in seats 2A & 2B (the first row on the B767-300ER aircraft) and the seats were comfortable enough with good leg room. However the aircraft was certainly showing its age. In business class (there is no first class on this flight) there are no seat-back screens and the passengers are given small tablets and Bose headphones on which to watch movies. The movie/music selection was poor and was nothing to get excited about. The food that we were served (breakfast and a pre- landing ""snack"") was probably the worst airline food we have ever experienced. It was virtually inedible and it compared extremely unfavourably with the food that we were served in British Airways business class on our flight to the USA three weeks earlier. Furthermore the cabin attendants were virtually invisible. On the eight-hour flight I was never once offered tea or coffee - all I was given was a bottle of water to drink. Two hours before the flight landed in London I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a Bacardi and Coke - no flight attendant ever asked me if I would like something to drink. Unlike British Airways business class on our American Airlines flight we could see no sign of a basket in the kitchen area containing anything to snack on (like bars and sweets). American Airlines do you think that this is acceptable? Just what are business class passengers paying several thousand dollars/pounds over the economy fare for? (You do not arrive any earlier than the people sitting in the back). The food and service we experienced on our flight from ORD to LHR were completely unacceptable and based on our recent experience fear that it will be a very long time before we fly on American Airlines in business class again.",1american-airlines,17/11/14,My wife and I flew from San Jose (SJC) to Chicago (ORD) on AA1530 in first class. San Jose is certainly a very pleasant little airport but unfortunately there is no American Airlines Admiral's Club room for first and business passengers. Our seats on the aircraft (3A & 3B - the first row of seats on the B737-800) were fairly comfortable and there was enough leg room. We had pre-ordered our meal on-line and it was described as miso chicken. Our meals although nicely served were of very poor quality so much so that my wife refused to eat any more after the first few mouthfuls. The flight attendant who looked after us was pleasant. courteous and helpful. But the three-hour flight as far as we were concerned was spoilt by food of very poor quality - not what you expect when you are travelling first class.,2american-airlines,17/11/14,DFW to LHR on new 777-300. Although American has updated their fleet and now have a business class seat that competes with most European carriers they really need to improve the service standard and the selection of their cabin personnel. Flight attendants were in a hurry to finish service and rude the quality of food just average and the presentation and amenities nothing remarkable. There was not the feeling of being in Business class on this flight.,3american-airlines,12/11/14,"LAX-Las Vegas (Return). Given its only a 40 minutes flight each way - not much can go wrong. The Flagship lounge at LAX was fine. Above expectations. Decent food and beverages. Spacious and quiet- and one I'd recommend. Flight both ways was on a brand new (you could ""smell"" it was brand new) on an A321 - a plane I'd not heard of - but apparently the ""new"" big brother to the A320. Great plane - in fact I'd say superb. Nice roomy first class that I'd be happy with on a 3-4 hour hour flight. Nice FAs. Plane both ways was rammed from end to end. Both flights left on time and landed ahead of schedule. What was noticeable was the gloomy faces on the return; assume this was down to losing to many dollars at the casinos - rather than the AA experience. All in all - a good experience.",9american-airlines,12/11/14,AA 262 B737 RSW to DFW 1st November 2014 good flight in First Class comfortable seat food surprisingly good for short flight no personal IFE seat not as good as US Airways A320.,7american-airlines,12/11/14,AA 50 DFW to LHR 777-300 1st November 2014. New Business class seating 3A beats BA's Club World product hands down IFE excellent Food OK - welcome drink in plastic cup. Overall would always look at AA's Business product if it was the new one over BA.,9american-airlines,12/11/14,I flew American for the first time today and will never fly with them again. My entire experience was horrible. My flight was delayed for 2 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight. So in addition to having already spent my whole morning in an airport I had to have my second flight rescheduled which cost me an additional 2 hours of wait time. Then my second flight is delayed 30 minutes because according to the pilot they hadn't removed the Jetway tunnel. Finally I arrive at my destination only to be informed that my luggage ended up on a different flight from mine and that I would have to wait an additional hour and a half before that flight arrived. Never using them again.,1american-airlines,11/11/14,We flew AA from Minneapolis to Chicago (ORD) to NY (LGA) - JFK to Paris (CDG) and MIA to MSP. After reading many bad reviews I though I would say that we had no bad experiences at all. we were given an exit row seat on our JFK-Paris flight. The food was normal airline food not great but I enjoyed the meals. I am 6 ft 2 and I had enough room on all my flights. The service was pleasant. The onboard entertainment was lacking on the 767 to Paris but I slept so it did not bother me.,7american-airlines,06/11/14,Manchester to Florida via Chicago. I had no real issue with the internal flights to Chicago but have a number of issues with the long haul flight to Chicago. The seats were in no way suitable very little leg room and I can imagine that it was very awkward if you didn't know the person sitting either side of you. The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options. The majority of the attendants were either rude sarcastic and had obviously missed the training session on customer service. Inflight entertainment was poor AA seem to be stuck in the dark ages with one tiny screen for every few seats. Overall I was very disappointed with the service which made a long flight seem even longer. I've definitely been spoilt with Virgin Atlantic who I will be using from now on.,3american-airlines,06/11/14,We always travel First class where available as we appreciate the extra details. We booked our family vacation first class from LAX to Maui on AA after a four day stop over in Disneyland. We had an early morning ride to the airport from Disneyland and check in went smoothly. The agent directed us to priority screening and The Admiral Lounge to relax in while waiting for our flight. Once we got to the lounge they tried to charge us $50 per person for lounge access. Normally with a first class ticket lounge access is part of that cost on all the other airlines we travel with. Not with American Airlines. They just chipped away at customer value by that one action for our family and I would recommend not using them if possible.,1american-airlines,06/11/14,Flew New York to Las Vegas - October 22nd flight #45. IÂ´m really surprised that American is not considered Low Cost. First you must do your own check in and pay $25 for your first luggage. Second you have to paid extra if you want a comfortable seat. I paid $59 to stretch my legs and I choose the first row after business class. There was a division panel so in fact there wasn't much room. Third in 5 hours flight only 1 complimentary drink and if you want food have to pay for it. Fourth They promote the internet onboard but this is not free $4 for email and more if you want to surf the net. The flight boarded with 1 hour and half delay due to a problem with a luggage compartment door. Seated onboard for another hour and then half an hour waiting for our turn to take off after leaving the gate.,2american-airlines,06/11/14,"LHR-LAX. I bought the First Class fare to Las Vegas via LAX as it was quite good value for money and I knew I would be getting AAs new First Class product on the 777-300ER - it was certainly a better bet than BAs Club World on an ageing 747 - the only alternative. I avoided the AA Flagship lounge at LHR T3 as I had read so many bad reviews. The BA alternative was okay. The plane was brand new and the new seat was fine. There are only 8 seats in the AA 1st Class on this plane. Nothing spectacular. It was roomy good TV good seat controls and a neat feature was the rotation to face out of the window. Food was well just okay. Nothing very stylish. A trout timbale to start. A nice spicey butternut squash soup came next. Boring salad - seen better in M&S. Chicken main was - well okay. Had better in my local pub. FAs were friendly and called passengers by name. For the money it was acceptable. Certainly not worth $10-12000+ return which is often the regular list price to LAX. It lacks the ""class"" wow factor which should be obvious when you fly in first.",7american-airlines,06/11/14,"LHR-ORD return I have come to the conclusion that AA are probably the worst Airline I have flown with. First of all the planes wouldn't look out of place in a museum I haven't seen such an antiquated IFE system since the 1990's - suspended CRT monitors and they have the gall to charge nearly $6 a head for headphones. The food is awful with no choice to speak of - breakfast on both flights was a choice between omelette or scrambled egg since my daughter will not eat egg dishes on the outbound flight we asked if they could provide an alternative were curtly told we should have ordered a special diet meal. On the return flight we upset the crew by taking my daughters breakfast on board with us. The final meal - no choice just pizza. On both flights it was served so late that no sooner had we opened our cutlery than we were begin badgered by give up our trays as the crew needed to prepare for landing. During the outbound flight having slept for four hours and with no response to the call button I walked back to the galley to request a drink for myself and my family only to be told ""You have run us all ragged on this flight so we have closed up the galley and are resting so you'll have to wait for the meal"".",1american-airlines,05/11/14,Used American on four flights SFO-LAX-MCO and TPA-MIA-LAX a mix of 738-800s 757 & A321. Despite losing a bag and a 2hr delay which where handled very well all flights were fine with nice crew seating and PTV on the A321. They don't serve food in economy on internal flights and I realise they are not SQ or CX but for the price I paid they are fine. I was able to use the lounge and book MCE seats because of my Oneworld status which made a little difference. My only complaint is compared to other Oneworld alliance members there lounges are miles away from either BA or CX.,8american-airlines,05/11/14,First time I flew American (I usually fly Delta) and I must say that overall I was impressed with the airline. On the way to NYC we departed on time and even got there 30 min early (never has happened to me before). The staff were helpful and the efficiency of the service was a huge plus to me. On the way back to Detroit we did board a bit late and sit on the runway for a while but again was a quick flight and really not much that I can complain about. Would recommend American Airlines.,8american-airlines,03/11/14,San Diego to Miami - seating was so tight I couldn't read a magazine when the seat in front of me reclined. Extra charges for everything. A truly horrible experience but it was non-stop and they were punctual.,2american-airlines,03/11/14,Never again. We booked to travel from Manchester to Orlando. The aircraft in both directions was old cramped and uncomfortable. The temperature of the cabin was inconsistent. The entertainment was rubbish no seat back TVs which have always been a standard for all international flights that we have travelled on. The aisle TVs could not be seen from window seats which was pointless and dark sections of the movie could not be seen at all. Food was terrible my salad arrived uncovered and food was average. Ground crew were frantically trying to get people to give up seats flight was overbooked with many families not sitting together and children split from their parents on the flight! AA was not much cheaper than my other flight options. Avoid travelling with them!,1american-airlines,03/11/14,My husband and I have just flown with AA from LHR to MIA and back and was very disappointed at the poor service and the rude and off hand attitude of the cabin staff in economy. As former Cabin crew myself I was astonished at the poor and lack of service on board. On the outbound flight there was no service for over 2.5 hrs as turbulence was expected. There was no attempt at any service during this time and the meal and drink were almost flung at us. I don't recall being offered a hot drink! No more service until the snack service which was an undercooked pizza. Pretty basic for a 9 hr day flight the return flight was no better. No drinks were served with breakfast as more turbulence was expected! There was no turbulence - in my opinion the crew didn't leave themselves enough time to carry out a full service. Considering the cost of the flight and the other ways airlines have of extracting money from pax such as priority boarding and choosing seats etc I expected better service and at least some courtesy! We felt that the service we received was unsatisfactory. I will not be recommending American Airlines after our disappointing experience.,2american-airlines,03/11/14,LAX to ORD via St. Louis one way in first. Both flights on time. Food was very good. Staff was very professional. All in all a very nice experience. Not much entertainment wise but these flights are not that long.,10american-airlines,31/10/14,AA is an embarrassment to US hospitality and service. I frequently fly business class transatlantic - have you tried to get past a neighbor who is lying flat to reach the aisle? It's almost impossible as the seats are so badly positioned and designed. And what about the Business lounge H at Heathrow the food available and decor are awful compared to any other major world airline - yes including some US competitors. Finally I am tired of the grumpy geriatric flight attendants that seem to dominate the ranks. All US airlines have lost ground compared to their European peers but AA is down at the bottom of the pile.,3american-airlines,31/10/14,Awful experience. The cabin crew are amongst the rudest least helpful people you are likely to come across in life. I was travelling with two small children 2years and 8months. Having spent the majority of the flight on my feet rocking my 8mth old to sleep she finally fell asleep. Breakfast arrived unfortunately I knocked the tray onto the floor. The member of cabin crew stepped over it ignoring it. When I apologised and asked for help to pick it up he curtly said he would get it later. The breakfast was strewn all over the floor in front of the toilet. I had a sleeping baby in my arms. When another passenger woke up half an hour later my fellow passenger was kind enough to pick the items up.,2american-airlines,31/10/14,My wife and I travelled overnight to Rome on AA on Oct. 1 from JFK. It was very disappointing. There were no in seat videos on the Boeing 767. The overhead screens continued to play movies until just before landing which prevented me form sleeping. The economy section food was uninspiring to say the least with stale dinner rolls and a wedge of cheese for dessert. This is our last international trip on AA.,3american-airlines,28/10/14,This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay Â£190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.,1american-airlines,28/10/14,I flew from CDG to JFK on October 14th. It was the cheapest direct flight which was quite punctual. So the basis is 100% fulfilled. But the overhead compartment opened during take off and things fell down. It reopened during landing. When I left the plane I said it to the steward he did not ask me where it was located. Just something common. In addition to this half of the flight was in the dark because of an electric malfunction that prevented us calling for assistance. That is the visible part of the aircraft for the passenger. To fly in an old plane ok but it has to be nicely maintained.,2american-airlines,28/10/14,Always delays even when the plane is the first one out in the morning. Frequently when there are going to be weather delays the airline won't cancel so you can make alternative arrangement until you have sat all day waiting. I fly frequently and American always has some excuse for why they can't help their delays. Sick of this airline.,1american-airlines,22/10/14,"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably; however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year.",4american-airlines,22/10/14,October 9 2014 AA 137 DFW to HKG. Flight departed Dallas pretty much on time. Once airborne hot paper towels were distributed following by drink service. Complimentary beers and wine. Shortly after drink service lunch was served followed by another round of drink service. Special vegetarian meal was provided. Meal consisted of rice and chick peas curry with a side salad with olive oil dressing and two pieces of melon as desert. Tiny quantity but tasted decent and edible. About 7 or 8 hours into the flight a mid flight snack was served with drinks. Three pieces of vegetarian wraps and a fruit salad was served. Less than two hours before landing in Hong Kong another meal was served. This time the meal was a cold pasta salad with two pieces of cantaloupe melon. Flight was about a little over 16 hours. Seats in Main Cabin Extra were fairly comfortable. Flight crew was professional but lack the grace of Asian carriers flight crew. No other amenities were provided like other Asian carriers such as toothbrush socks eye masks etc. However a refreshments self service counter was set up in the galley and juices and water were available through out the flight. IFE was surprisingly good with many new movies and TV shows available on demand. No flight deck announcement but flight crew provided information in English Cantonese and Mandarin. All in all a satisfactory flight with inexpensive fare compared to Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines but nothing special. Flight crew did not attempt to make passengers feel particularly welcome nor rude to passengers. Better than expected.,7american-airlines,22/10/14,I recently flew from Chicago to Dublin Ireland on American Airlines - never again. The planes on both legs were filthy the toilets stank there was no individual IFE only shared screens on a 8.5 hour transatlantic flight the cabin crew were the rudest most unfriendly people I have ever met everybody sitting around me agreed. People had asked for blankets etc. but never got them. And to add insult to injury we were delayed 2.5 hours out of Dublin the crew didn't apologize and hit and the back so as to not have to deal with the passengers. If traveling from Chicago to Dublin I highly recommend either Aer Lingus or United. Both have good IFE their planes are clean and their staff are pleasant and accommodating. American Airlines in my opinion has gone downhill despite all their promises of improving their planes and services.,1american-airlines,22/10/14,Flew with AA Flight 734 Miami to Philadelphia to connect to Manchester on 30th September. The outbound flights both with US Airways. AA refused point bank to help me book the seats for 734 when I rang the UK customer services. Both agents need a training course last one told me to arrange seats at airport. US Airways helped me with seats for my family on their 3 legs. I tried to log in to my flight the night before to book seats to together and found to my horror there were no seats together and I had no choice but to choose from the few left. Arrived at Miami and flight was showing on time. Shortly before take off it became a 30 minute delay. Many people waiting concerned as they had connections like us. Some had no boarding passes for their US airways flight as they could not print these on check in. Unhelpful lady at desk would not help meaning those without passes then had to go chasing around PHL airport to get passes printed. Flight landed 30 minutes late cue rush as the plane was packed and most had connections to make. We were lucky as our flight departed from Terminal A. Still it left no time to go to any shops or buy food and drink. For their abysmal customer service for refusing to help me but worse by far for the first time in my life having my entire family split up on a plane and having to sit with total strangers I will boycott AA. US Airways in contrast were very good and helpful. Goodbye AA they just don't seem to care anymore. Had to give 1 star for entertainment. Should be a 0 option as unless you pay you get nothing! Wifi? Oh yes pay for that as well!,1american-airlines,20/10/14,October 6th 2014 MIA-STT. American Airlines is a low budget airline at best with premium airline prices. The service that American Airlines provide is on par with Spirit Airlines and Ryanair. Why pay so much to get there when someone else gets you there for less with same level of service.,1american-airlines,20/10/14,I have not flown for a long time but I must say I was very disappointed. I took a trip from Tampa Florida to Boston MA and twice fights were delayed. It's a shock to me that airlines charge so much to fly and then your experience is so poor. In this day and age delays should not be happening for this amount of time. I cannot consider them again.,1american-airlines,20/10/14,I took a flight from Phoenix to Miami with Nassau Bahamas my final destination. I was extremely disappointed in the first class service. On a 3.5 hour flight we were offered one glass of either wine or water and twice a snack. Granted it was a red eye flight regardless the service should have at least offered a breakfast and coffee/tea. We landed at 7.30 Miami time which is long past morning coffee. This is the second time I took this flight and won't travel it again.,1american-airlines,20/10/14,Flew from Manchester to New York and it was by far the worst airline I've ever flown with. Old tired plane with aisle screens - shocking when flying international. I couldn't even listen to the film as something had broken off inside where I was meant to plug in my earphones. The flight attendants response? 'Oh I'm not sure what I can do about that.' Disgusting customer service. The so called 'entertainment' consisted of 1 film then American programmes that I've never even heard of then it was turned off altogether 2 hours before we landed! The staff were very abrupt and just looked fed up - the food was hands down the worst I've ever had on a flight.,1american-airlines,12/10/14,This is the first time in about 15 years that I have flown AA. Never again! This airline doesn't care about customer service. Our flight out of DFW was delayed 4.5 hrs. Never was there an announcement. The gate changed 5 times. The flight being delayed was never addressed. DFW airport at AA is absolutely awful. While sitting for 5 hours and speaking to other passengers we found out the majority of flights were delayed for some reason or other. There were few if any gate representatives around. Nothing was explained to anyone.,1american-airlines,12/10/14,Round-trip Toronto to Dallas Sep 29 - 30. New A319 on both segments - aircraft clean and shiny. Paid for premium seat and well worth the $80 for the round trip. Lots of leg room exit row on return segment. AVOD and AC power available to all seats. Perhaps it's the new hardware making everyone happier - cabin crew was polite and friendly on both legs in contrast to several other AA flights in recent years.,8american-airlines,12/10/14,Traveled with AA MIA to SFO and return. Oct 1st and 5th. 738 on the first leg. 5.5 hr min flight one beverage service offered. Return flight 757 and 2 beverage services offered. Pay extra for better cabin seats pay to check a bag and hardly a smile. Really felt like cattle and not a pleasant experience. Waited for one hour to receive bags on the return arrival in Miami. It is truly a shame to see the deterioration of service in the industry and the total lack of customer care.,1american-airlines,12/10/14,Over crowded flight. They actually overbooked. Had 2 hour delay and another hour delay on the connecting flight. Had to literally run to the connecting gate due to such a late arrival the gates were very far apart. Plane was filthy. I don't think they clean them ever. Seats are small and uncomfortable. Can't even fully open the tray tables. I'm not a large person and I was unable to do it so I'm sure large people can't use them at all. However they do have tablets built into the seats but you can't do much on them unless you pay a high fee. Will not fly with American Airline again.,1american-airlines,08/10/14,My Wife and I flew 28th Sept Vancouver to DFW to Orlando Business/First. Breakfast omelette cold sent back asked for a second warm scone instead! We were not the only pax to send the cold omelettes back. Admiral Club in DFW refused us entry. Never refused entry into Airline lounges before showing First/Business class tickets? My Priority Pas came to the rescue allowing me entry into a different lounge at DFW. The staff seemed very disinterested in what was going on and this includes a non existent cabin check prior to landing at Orlando. Will never waste my Dollars on First/Business on American domestic flights in the future. Nearly forgot - had to pay for wi-fi!,5american-airlines,08/10/14,"Original flight was from LGA to DFW. After flying in circles in the air for half an hour we finally re-routed to land in Little Rock Arkansas. We sat on the runway in the plane for at least two hours with no offerings of good or water even after the 4 hour flight. I understand completely this is weather related and only looking out for our safety however this was not handled well at all. When asking the stewardess for water- it's like it was a huge inconvenience. We finally deboard the plane in Arkansas and were told to wait around to see if the flight is officially cancelled - an hour later it was. Hotel rooms were not offered to be paid for not even a meal or anything at all. Everyone paid out of pocket and waited to de board the next morning. Back at the airport at 6am and we were told to use our old boarding passes and go directly to security- they refused us and made is wait back in the long American Airlines line to get a new boarding pass. My final destination was Austin which was also cancelled. They put me on a flight to Houston in first class which was unexpected. However I decided to just rent a car and drive to Austin from Dallas but I was told that there was no possible way to get my bag because it was listed as priority to Houston. Well our flight from Arkansas to Dallas was delayed an hour then the flight from Dallas to Houston was delayed another hour. First class wasn't anything special honestly more leg room and drinks served in glass instead of plastic. Finally arrive in Houston waiting at baggage claim and guess what - my bag isn't there. I was told it was on the next flight coming in from Dallas which infuriated me after I wanted to originally take my bag in Dallas as it was. Waited around the airport for another hour or so and finally get my bag with a big orange sticker on it saying ""priority"". Yeah right. Never will fly American again.",1american-airlines,08/10/14,JFK-LAX First class. Good but not overwhelming as it should be. Seat on A321 is good but has some problems very hard to get out or in while even partly reclined. Food was mediocre in quality although presented nicely. Flight crew was wonderful but honestly the whole experience is either over priced or under done. Jet Blue Mint on my outbound was much better.,7american-airlines,05/10/14,Travelled for work to Santa Fe from Washington Dulles via Dallas Fort Worth. All the planes were on time and clean. No entertainment offered in MD80 old planes they should retire them. Everything on sale including headphones for $5 and you can take home after use. My company paid $1100 for this economy class ticket which is probably worth $300. Staff was all very friendly and offered whatever they can so acceptable behaviour there.,8american-airlines,05/10/14,Last night I flew from O'Hare to Dublin Ireland with American Airlines. I am a seasoned transatlantic traveler and have flown all airlines from North American to either Shannon or Dublin Ireland. On boarding the 767-200 aircraft I was astonished that there was no AVOD on the place only the large overhead screens which went out 15 years ago. Everybody sitting around me was annoyed as we all had to watch the same movies for the 7.5 hour flight. It is probably going to be the same on the 8.5 return flight - never again American Airlines.,1american-airlines,05/10/14,"AA104 JFK-LHR 20 Sept - Long queues at ""Priority"" Check-in at Kennedy thirty minute wait as agents struggled to help passengers from strike-bound Air France. TSA security a shambles (not the airlines fault). Admiral's Club a little crowded but a haven. Greeted by smilingly efficient desk staff. Bartender knew the drill two stiff Grey Goose and Tonics swiftly dispensed (but cheap and nasty plastic glasses?) Boarding was smooth and quick cabin crew a tad overwhelmed trying to stow overhead bins on this full to bursting flight. Main Cabin Extra (19D) seat would be well worth the small surcharge but complimentary to Ruby and above frequent flyers anyway. Great IFE OK food dished out promptly after take-off. Croissant juice and coffee before early Heathrow arrival. Bags already delivered by the time I got to the belt. From being the third world poor relation of the Oneworld Alliance American seem to be vastly improved; new aircraft and good service at an excellent price. My next transatlantic trip with them (to Chicago in November) is on a 767 with a retro 25 year old cabin fit though - watch this space.",7american-airlines,05/10/14,Recently flew DUB-ORD - 22 year old 767 ORD-LAX-SFO 737's SFO-LAX-LHR 737 and new 777. Apart from the fact that I got there and back safely I must say what a disappointment the airline is in terms of inflight entertainment comfort staff and food/drinks. I fly regularly from the UK mainly East on EU/Asian airlines or within Europe and I now realise how spoilt we are here. When comparing AA to QR EK etc they just do not compare in any regard. The old 767 aircraft in a very tired state still had analogue buttons for their armrest music entertainment system and huge drop down crt displays. Food was awful and very poor quality on takeoff. The pre-landing snack a deep dish pizza was much better albeit on the greasy side. Domestic US services were on 737's - one with the new sky interior and 2 older interiors. All perfectly fine to get me from point A to B. Plenty of rather expensive food purchase options in the terminals and ability to bring food on board was good. I did not think much of the in- flight food menu for purchase - limited choice and not great quality it would seem. Nice touch for in-flight wi-fi although I didn't use it. The biggest disappointment and a real embarrassment was the supposed 'flagship American service' from LAX-LHR. Super cramped seating in 10 abreast layout in economy meant no elbow room whatsoever. Very poor in-flight entertainment system - hard to navigate difficult to find music titles plus generally limited selection. The catering was shockingly poor for dinner a chicken dish which was flavourless and served with a salad with grated cheese and dressing some crackers with cheese spread a biscuit for dessert and a cold and chewy roll. Breakfast was similarly disappointing and consisted of a yoghurt orange juice and a horrible leathery croissant served with jam and butter. A continental breakfast on a service between the states and the UK? Where is the sausage and eggs? Even Qatar give the above and a hot dish as their breakfast in better quality. The embarrassment really comes with the announcement at the start of the flight where we are introduced and welcomed to their 'flagship' service. It is laughable. On a plus note the drinks service was perfect. Crew were very hit and miss on all sectors. 767 is way above the 777 in terms of comfort and space. I would much rather have 9 abreast in a 777 or a 22 year old 767 then this flagship 777. Good USB/power options though - that's probably the only thing that they got right on AA136. I would go out of my way to avoid AA in future unless price is the only factor.,1american-airlines,05/10/14,AA #202 LAX/BOS in First Class Sept 28. On time both ends old first class. Crew worked very hard with drinks Samsung tablets and then lunch. Seemed a bit hectic but the galley space is close to seating. Tablets require a lot of the crew but are fine to use with good selection easy controls and good definition. Lunch was respectable and crew remained available throughout the flight for drink refills and distribution of snack before landing. A good experience with obvious efforts made to live up to advertised quality.,8american-airlines,05/10/14,Manchester to Las Vegas via Chicago. I currently live in Dubai and travel quite frequently using Emirates so I have probably been spoilt. The planes we flew on with American from the outside looked very modern however once we boarded things were very different. The interiors were outdated and looked like they had been in use since the 70's the interior was dull and the seats were like something out of a scrap yard mine was actually broken from were the trolleys had banged into it coming down the aisles. None of the economy seats had single televisions which I just could not believe for a long haul flight! Only business class are given portable tablets to watch the entertainment. The food was very poor and tasteless and the flight crew were bickering between themselves from take off to landing. I was extremely disappointed with this airline and I have vowed never to fly with them again please be warned as we spent a lot of money on this holiday only to be left disappointed by this carrier.,2american-airlines,01/10/14,AA101 LHR/JFK 10Sept. Efficient and friendly One World priority check-in. Comfortable Admiral's Club - breakfast baked goods decent coffee. Smooth boarding onto fresh-from-the-factory Boeing 777. 19D in Main Cabin Extra - more legroom 9 abreast config (10 across in the main cabin). On-time departure. Excellent communication from flight- deck. Top class entertainment (but take your own headphones) IFE can be viewed from gate to gate. Good cabin service - food and drink could be better. Complimentary beer and foul wine on offer. Half an hour ahead of schedule at New York. Plenty of agents staffing passport control. Prompt baggage delivery. Good flight at bargain basement fare - well done!,8american-airlines,01/10/14,Travelled last week from Vancouver to Lima via Dallas on a paid business class fare. Entire experience was a huge disappointment the flight crews were indifferent seats were uncomfortable especially in the 757's from DFW to Lima. Did not get my pre ordered meal on the Lima - DFW return. As a business class passenger the Admirals Club at DFW was underwhelming. Had to pay for water. Will travel any other airline unless there is no other option. What a horrible product.,1american-airlines,01/10/14,Flights r/t SFO-JFK in the new A321 in C SFO-JFK and F on the return. First the F flight was simply the best domestic flight I have experienced in at least a decade. The new F seat is essentially the same as CX uses for long haul business a lie flat seat which is entirely private. The IFE screen is huge and the selection of movies is vast. Service was superb and attentive. The food was the best domestic food I have had for a decade (of course nothing will bring back the old days of caviar and meat carved on a trolley from the old days). The outbound C experience was excellent. Seat very comfortable and spacious. Service was good and meal acceptable. Should add it is a pleasure to fly on a brand new aircraft.,10american-airlines,01/10/14,I flew with American Airline from CDG to NYC and was outraged by the aircraft used a 757 with a very uncomfortable Biz Class old seats and basically an outdated aircraft. The inflight service was just OK and it is far from the standards used by American when flying to Asia. On the return trip it was a 767 and the experience was as awful as the way in. There is no comparable Biz Class in any Major European airlines American should rethink their product and services approach on these routes. Pathetic!,1american-airlines,01/10/14,Fight #1636 from Miami to Washington DC on Friday September 24 delayed for an hour due to the problem in Chicago then sat for 1.5 hrs inside the plane with no AC due to a maintenance issue. Typical of this airline - being treated like cattle.,1american-airlines,01/10/14,I flew on 23rd Sept.2014 on AA291 from Dublin to New York and after over 30 years flying with American I can say the airline is in deep trouble the staff obviously did not care about the passengers and if that is what happens in business class I feel sorry for economy class which is a cattle truck anyway. No water offered no wine offered no announcement about baggage pick-up at JFK. You had to ask for everything and the body language was why are you bothering us.,1american-airlines,22/09/14,I had to take my parents to the airport today to fly from SEA to JFK. We were on Alaskan Airlines flight powered by American Airlines. They were early to the airport for check-in at Alaska but got directed to go to American Airlines because for some reason we needed to check in there. The Alaskan Airlines employees were very cheerful and eager to help. Then when we showed up to American Airlines we were not even able to check-in even though they had 43 minutes before takeoff. They were 2 minutes late for automated check in. Then they had to wait in another line which gave them another flight which added an extra stop in Dallas. This changed their travel time from 5.5 hrs originally to a 9 hr journey. We had to accept even though we tried to plead them to get them on the original flight. The terrible thing is that they got to their standby gate 15 minutes earlier than the original flight was going to take off. And by no means are my parents fast people even with the normal lines in TSA. They could have made their original flight! I will never do third party travel sites again and the stupid confusion on flights was terrible.,1american-airlines,18/09/14,Flew this week Austin to Boston via DFW. Coach on the way up First on the return. Always impressed with the AUS- DFW flights even in coach they still serve the always full 124 pax a beverage on a 35 minute flight. MD-80 to DFW Main Cabin Extra as always comfortable and once again beverage service. B738 in Main Cabin Extra to Boston seats were fine the plane was clean the coach flight attendants on this route were somewhat disinterested. Only one beverage service and offer for food on a 4 hour flight. B757 with old interior on return. Didn't know any plans with these seats still existed. I did forget how large the seats are. Old seats but still comfortable. The two First Class flight attendants on this 4 hour leg were fantastic. Excellent service good red wine with dinner and a (4) course meal including a smoked salmon appetizer. Great food great service as always. Terminal C Admirals Club was a nice rest spot for our 90 minute lay over. MD-80 in First on the short 32 minute trip to Austin. Still a nice drink in their new glassware with Malano cookies out of the snack basket. AA still excels any other domestic carrier with regards to food offerings and beverage service especially in coach.,10american-airlines,18/09/14,Flew last month business class JFK-CDG. Flight delayed almost 4 hours announced 1 hour prior to departure. The attendant in the lounge told me we were lucky we had a plane. After boarding I was told the seat was not operational there was a barely visible sticker. But they did not know to what degree. The pilot had to look it up in his log. This took some 30 minutes. Verdict seat does not recline at all! They moved me to the back an arms reach from the coach bathroom. Each time someone went in and came out door slamming flash of light. There were 2 other much more desirable seats 4 AB it turned out those were for the staff. AA knows this are undesirable seats and it does not book them for their employees. The service on AA compared to other airlines is pitiful. With a few exceptions they treat you like they are doing you a favor. You never see a smile. The food most of the time is just plain bad. Due to the delay I almost missed my connection. After arriving to my final destination I found out that my luggage did not make it they found it 2 days later. Due to having to file paperwork for the missing luggage I missed my connection. AA is trying to blame it on the other airline.,1american-airlines,18/09/14,AA #2251 BOS/DFW on 9/8/2014 in first class. Flight left and landed on time. Seats comfortable though not the new lie flat. No seat AVOD. But the service the lunch were fine. Lots of refills for drinks updates from the flight deck. Connecting at DFW to Qantas to Sydney and transfer of luggage at DFW successful. A happy experience all in all.,10american-airlines,17/09/14,Miami - Los Angeles. Booked the tickets in advance so the cost of travelling first class for a near 6 hour trip was good value against the price charged for economy. Check in quick and we boarded on time with no delays. The crew were excellent attentive without being intrusive used our names when asking what we would like to drink and all made us all feel welcome on board. The food was very palatable. IFE was limited to drop down screens as the aircraft whilst scheduled to be one of the newer A321s in two class configuration was swapped out for an older 737 still wearing the old AA livery hence the 2 stars for IFE. Overall a very positive experience with AA on this flight.,10american-airlines,17/09/14,This is my first and last time to fly AA. Booked my vacation 6 months in advanced for Sunday to Sunday in the Dominican Republic. Arrived on Sunday morning to find out AA switched our flight to their sister company US Airways. Went to US airways to check in and they had no record of the switch. Went back to AA and after a search located our reservation. However this took so long that we missed our flight and they didn't have anything else going out on that day. They rebooked us for Monday morning and tried fixing it with $200 voucher (my non refundable room was $300 plus missing a day of vacation). On Monday morning (5.15 am flight) we showed up and checked in and got on the plane it is now 6.15 am and we are still sitting at the gate because an exterior light is out. You would thing they could have fixed it overnight. Anyway no matter how the rest of the flight goes they can't change my mind about the low scores on this review.,1american-airlines,17/09/14,Great flight from JFK back to LA. Great service that was friendly and professional. The new airbus was polished and the cabin smart. I actually got four hours sleep on the new flatbed. Pre drinks meal service and the cookie and milk prior to landing was super nice and very much felt like service on there international routes when AA is on point. I have had nightmare crew on international flights like many reviewers have mentioned but AA really has made a substantial effort to compete on the NYC/LA route. Will fly them again and maybe try there first class product.,10american-airlines,17/09/14,I was scheduled to leave on Thursday at 3:05 PM (august 28 2014). I was called by American and notified that my flight was delayed out of San Diego so my connections would be missed. American then rescheduled me for a flight the following day at 8:30pm (over 29 hours after the departure date I had scheduled). I then called American and got them to put me on the original flight that was delayed and move my connecting flights. My plan was to just sleep in Chicago and fly from Chicago to London and London to Nice the following day. After taking the original delayed flight I got a hotel in Chicago for 200$ because the flight out the next day was not until 5:05pm. 5 hour delay on the flight from Chicago to London - over 2 hours were on-board sitting at the gate. I missed the connection from London to Nice and they put me on another flight which was also delayed 1 hour. I finally arrived in Nice over 24 hours later than the ticket I purchased. On the way back to San Diego everything went smoothly except my luggage did not make one of my connections. I finally got them to deliver the bag 56 hours after I landed.,1american-airlines,17/09/14,Most frustrating travel experience traveled from DC to Honolulu trip planned paid for fewer stops and earlier arrival leaving DCA boarded plane on time then proceeded to sit on a boarded full plane for 1.5 hours because there was an overlooked routine mechanical issue preventing the plane from regulating the cabin temperature. Missed connection gave me a ticket including two stops and no talk of partial refund just a condescending align. Fast forward 1 week and again we're delayed by 2hrs in Honolulu. If you value your time do not fly American airlines.,1american-airlines,17/09/14,"I don't fly with American Airlines much anymore but I flew them to Seattle for Thanksgiving so flights were busy. I was in the very last row (row 32) of an MD-80 - it was noisy back there. My aunt was carrying our babies car seat which had food inside it it dropped into the first class aisle and one of the FA's glared at us and said ""you're dropping food!"" I mean really and she didn't even offer to help carry it? Fortunately a courteous passenger came and helped. Flight Attendant in coach was a lot nicer she even gave us some food for free after she saw how stressed we were. Then the return flight was cancelled because they could not get the hangar door open so American Airlines gave us some Hotel Vouchers. After getting back to the airport American Airlines gave us seats in First Class to make up for the bad night we had free food with larger seats and more legroom was ok but it was just not enough. We were tired and wanted to get home after landing back in Charlotte we had to deal with riding a packed bus to get back to the Long Term parking lot. This was the most tiring trip I have ever had for a domestic flight.",5american-airlines,17/09/14,"9/10 from West Palm Beach to SNA 2.35pm connection in Chicago missed the 5.10 connection. Flight was delayed and missed connection - reason ""it happens traffic"". When I miss my flight because of traffic American charges passengers we should have vouchers for every time an Airlines misses timelines.",1american-airlines,14/09/14,Flew with AA on our internal flights in Economy Plus due to one of our team being Gold with Qantas. That little extra leg room makes the difference. They were all short flights of no more than 2 hours so not getting feed was not an issue. Check in was good and service was friendly. We had a 2 hour delay in Miami due to a fuel delivery issue that was affecting most of the airport not just our flight. They keep us well informed. We had to terminate one of our through flights in Chicago on our way to St Louis due to one of our team becoming ill. We went straight to check-in to advise them that we would not be continuing our flight to St Louis and they were unable to stop our bags from going to St Louis. But they did everything they could to return our bags to us. They put them on the first flight back to Chicago and delivered them to our hotel later than night. Great service. Overall great flights and friendly service and excellent at returning our bags.,9american-airlines,14/09/14,LHR-MIA-GRU and GRU-JFK. Very quiet plane and cheery crew London to Miami Miami to Sao Paulo delayed about 90 minutes and crew a bit more grumpy. But they were sunny by comparison with the miserable team who took us up from GRU to JFK - good job there was superb IFE on a brand new plane (with disco lighting) to make up for it. I don't the cardigans and ties at half-mast helped. Having said that the AA/Oneworld staff at JFK did a great job in helping me transfer in about 30 minutes in order to catch a BA flight back to LHR.,7american-airlines,14/09/14,Usually fly oneworld carriers. Last flight on American was a complete disaster. Boarded on time and it took 2 hrs before take off no explanation given until we left the gate. Very old 757. They said maintenance. Still some FA appeared on board before departing. Once airborne no service on a 4hr flight to SJU from JFK only food for purchase. FA rude and not professional. Arrived very late. It took more than 45 min to get luggage.,1american-airlines,09/09/14,"SEA-DFW-MIA-MVD both ways flights. I had low expectations based on previous trips on this route with this airline. Even when the 767 airplanes they are using on the MIA-MVD route are old beaten down and the business class seating is at the minimum acceptable level the price matches what one can consider a ""budget trip"". However I could smell unpleasant odors from the bathrooms both ways from MVD while seating on row 3 in business class. This may not be acceptable to any business class passenger I must say. Also I verified that bathrooms were not cleaned by the staff. Perhaps some disinfecting towels would do passengers can clean the bathrooms by themselves and help with the smell. Anything but making your stomach revolt when having your dinner or breakfast in business class. I sincerely hope that American Airlines replace their aircraft on the MIA-MVD route as soon as possible with more suitable modern aircraft.",6american-airlines,06/09/14,"Flt 986 St Thomas to Miami. ATC Delay in Miami (didn't tell us why but probably weather) not AA fault. Our aircraft left Miami for St Thomas returned due to medical emergency not AA fault. Aircraft arrived St Thomas and we departed 7.40pm (instead of 2.58pm) not AA fault. Arrived Miami and after 3 hours standing in line because in spite of knowing the flight was delayed four hours no one checked hotel room availability. We received meal vouchers for dinner ($12 and the restaurants were closed) voucher for hotel room (received at 2am waited 35 minutes for a van to a Holiday Inn had to be back at 5 to take advantage of the breakfast voucher $6 before the 7.14am flight to Dallas). Try to buy dinner for $12 or breakfast for $6 at Miami international. While we were in line no movement for over an hour because no one had checked room availability. Two attendants initially handling the entire rebooking for the flight. After over an hour another showed up at an adjacent gate. Shortly 'Denise' decided it was time for her to leave. She was 'supposed to leave twenty minutes ago"". Extremely poor planning overall. Poor accommodation after the fact. This is becoming the typical customer service quality for American and is really disappointing.",1american-airlines,06/09/14,AA51 LHR - DFW in new 773. American have hit the bullseye! Excellent service and food from the crew. AVOD system has more movies than you can look at! The seat is extremely comfortable. Inflight bar area is a nice place to stretch and have a chat. Definitely look to fly on this plane again.,9american-airlines,06/09/14,"LAX-DFW-ATL AA2410 1 Sep 14. S80 ancient aircraft. Very uncomfortable seats. Almost one-hour delay in DFW because of ""broken-seat"" paperwork. Delay in landing at ATL because we lost our gate. Slow baggage handling. Staying away from AA for a year or so.",2american-airlines,06/09/14,We flew from Manchester to New York at the end of August as a couple. We were surprised to be automatically allocated leg-room seats by an emergency exit at no extra cost. However we were extremely surprised and disappointed to be on a very old plane (still old logo) and had no personal TV screens for a long haul flight! I have never encountered this before. We could also barely see the shared TV screens. Only one film of two was shown. The air hostesses were distracted tired looking and talking amongst themselves for much of the flight. It felt like an internal AA flight. All the same was exactly true for our return flight but furthermore they could not seat us together on our wedding anniversary. If this is how UK Manchester customers are treated (the same surely can't be true flying out of London!) then prices should reflect the poor service. Avoid AA if at all possible.,3american-airlines,06/09/14,I flew early September 14 from Kuala Lumpur to Hartford CT return. The quality was very uneven. From KL to Hartford it was okay. On the long parts (KL to Frankfurt Frankfurt to Charlotte) we were given two meals and a snack. The meals were okay but I was disappointed on the snack which was cookies and chocolate. Of course no menu as with Etihad and Qatar. I know I know I chose the airline because of the low price. I was even more disappointed on the trip back. On the flight from Chicago to London the seats and space were so tight we could barely move. The plane looked old and shabby. It still had those communal TV!. Come on! On a 7-hour flight? Those things were so outdated! The flight from Heathrow was much better. It's the new A380. Still food was not much better. By the way flights from KL to Europe and Europe to KL were operated by Malaysian Airlines but the ones from Europe to US and vice versa were by AA. Overall I wouldn't recommend taking AA flying from Asia to US.,5american-airlines,01/09/14,"LAS-DFW-LGA-YUL. All flights were smooth and on time. The service the flight attendants and the seat comfort were fine nothing special. The second leg it was full and it was a hassle before take off with all the carry on bags the crew were asking passengers to collaborate by placing their smaller item under the front seat. This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines. I would fly with them if they offer a low price.",7american-airlines,01/09/14,"Brand new 773 lovely looking aircraft clean interior but inferior product and service compared to alliance partner British Airways. 10 abreast seating is appalling for a long haul flight no comfort no headphones (this caught a lot of passengers out) cabin crew responded with ""the company doesn't give us any!"" - limited interaction with the passengers throughout flight. All in all very disappointing service with the ""new American"".",2american-airlines,01/09/14,"After a 6 hour delay originally attributed to a broken air conditioning component estimated to take ""45 minutes"" to fix myself and several other passengers changed our tickets to another later flight to the same destination. After being boarded on that second aircraft we were informed that the ""maintenance log had been removed from the aircraft and not returned as expected"" so we would need to wait until it was located. Initially this appeared to be mere incompetence but swiftly came to seem like subterfuge. Fully an hour later we have just been told there is a panel on our aircraft that has to be replaced. This is supposed to take 1 hour. Meanwhile our original aircraft remains grounded without further explanation. As a passenger I am apprehensive flying on aircraft in such poor repair and moreover feel deceived repeatedly by gate agents and flight crew who are either misinformed themselves or deliberately trying to hide the sorry state of American's fleet. This will be my last flight on American were I not attempting to attend a family wedding I would deplane now.",1american-airlines,01/09/14,Flew from DFW to LHR on a 777-200 with my seven year old daughter. This flight was completely full but was acceptable for a long haul flight. The crew were very nice and helpful with my daughter and made her feel at home on her first transatlantic flight. The food and beverage was quite good for economy. Coming back to the USA was an entirely different story. Flew from DUB-Chicago on an old outdated 767-300 that smelt bad and looked very worn. The carpet was dirty and so was the seats. Additionally it was unacceptable to fly transatlantic with community video screens that appear to be running from a DVD setup with poor picture quality and sound. Again the crew was fantastic and treated my daughter extremely well and was very help with making arrangements to catch our next flight to Dallas even though we arrived over an hour late. Completing Customs and Immigration in Dublin saved us from missing out next flight. For the money paid the quality experience was unacceptable.,3american-airlines,01/09/14,Flight from London to Miami then Miami to La Paz. By far the most disappointing flight we have had. The cabin crew were unbelievably rude disinterested and unhelpful. We've had much better service with budget airlines. Thought it was ridiculous that people could reserve seats up to one year in advance. Our flights were booked by a tour company so we were unaware of this until a few days before and therefore left with disappointing seats on the way out to our honeymoon destination. Will not fly with American Airlines again.,1american-airlines,01/09/14,"LHR to Miami return. Where to start. New logo - but old plane old staff old service. 'Turkey slider' in business class? Pre-formed mush. Surly badly dressed cabin crew. One of them was chewing gum and playing Candy Crush when I went to the bathroom! AA lounges in LHR awful - compare that to BA or Virgin! Even worse lounge in Miami - two vouchers for free drinks - for Â£4k? 13 year old 777 noisy  flat bed only goes down part way and worst of all - no laptop power adapters available ""We've stopped providing them""! Well you know what I've stopped using AA.",1american-airlines,28/08/14,FCO-ORD. ORD-CMH Flew an ancient plane with no IFE with one shared TV. Seats were uncomfortable. Food was better this time around although the service was bad. The crew missed out serving several rows multiple times on the flight although they kept the drinks coming very frequent. One of the crew members stopped the food service for close to 10 minutes to continue speaking to a passenger about her family.,4american-airlines,28/08/14,DFW-ABQ on Aug. 8 and return ABQ-DFW on Aug 15 both legs in First (due to upgrade) on an MD80. Flights nothing special but OK given the limitations on US domestic flights - obviously older planes but comfortable and cabins looked fresher than expected so obviously well maintained/renovated. Catering in First for both 100 minute flights during meal hours was a pack of pretzels and full bar service. White wine on the evening flight to ABQ was warm Chardonnay. FA's were friendly and efficient on the on the flight to ABQ and rather uninterested on the flight back to DFW. Delay of 45 minutes on the flight to ABQ but AA maintained that the flight will be on time until 15 minutes before the designated departure time although a delay was obvious as there was no plane at the gate so slightly irritating bad communication. Return flight eventless and on time. So nothing special but no major problems either. All in all a very average experience.,6american-airlines,26/08/14,Recently flew this airline transatlantic route from Dublin to Chicago. The experience was awful! The plane itself was so outdated and old fashioned. It had the screens that dropped down from the ceiling! However on the outward bound flight the crew announced they were not working. So I had a seven hour flight with no film . The crew all wore different uniforms which made them look shabby and unprofessional. I am used to flying European airlines like BA and Aer Lingus whose planes all have the modern personal screens etc and whose cabin crew look smart and professional. My advice is stay well away from AA. I will never again use this airline.,1american-airlines,26/08/14,Flight from Chicago to Cleveland cancelled for no reason. Put on standby 4 flights and 10 hours later with no help from gate attendants we fly into Cleveland. Flying out of Cleveland - flight cancelled night before no reason given. Re-booked on earlier flight. Arrive at airport and or course we're not on the manifest. Staff member very rude. Clearly no one who works for American likes it or it's customers either. Since American had cancelled 3 flights the day before they had nothing to do but put us on a United flight where we had to pay an extra $160 for baggage hat we would not have had to pay as our origin tickets were on Alaska Airlines. Never again.,1american-airlines,26/08/14,American Airlines cancelled a flight with no warning claimed weather related but on looking at radar for this flight path that was fabricated. They made no effort to notify by email or cell phone (had both). I found out about the canceled flight when I arrived at the gate with my boarding pass. This resulted in a 15 hour drive. My advice - find a different airline.,1american-airlines,26/08/14,Flew out to Dallas from Heathrow in the new Boeing 777 which as a plane was okay and had good entertainment. They have a 343 layout which makes it cramped compared to a lot of other airlines I have flown with which have a 333 layout which feels more spacious. Some of the flight crew were quite unprofessional. One of them walking around with earphones in holding his iPod in his hand. Food was close to terrible. Returned on a Boeing 767 which had been painted on the outside to make it look modern but was like a museum on the inside. Old TV monitors hanging from the ceiling which showed one film on a nine hour flight which I couldn't watch as somebody had snapped off their headphone jack in my socket. Checked in really early but still sat apart. Food terrible again but flight crew a bit more professional this time. Have flown over 30 different airlines and I would say this airline is in the bottom 3.,3american-airlines,26/08/14,GRU-JFK and JFK-LHR: American Main Cabin Extra. Exit seat on both flights. Excellent price brand new planes. Greatly improved service food improved. There are better airlines for premium service nicer food but if you can make Platinum (50000 miles a year) then this is for me unbeatable.

Contacted my husband about the weather when it came to my flight home and the weather was clear. They had delayed our trip for 9 hours for no apparent reason and had failed to inform us of this. They had delays due to weather early that morning the flight coming from Dallas to Vegas was sitting at the airport and wouldn't load their passengers. Waited around for 9 hours only to find out by 10 pm that night that the flight was cancelled and it was too late to get a hotel. The staff in Vegas were very rude and pretentious. They didn't care about any of the passengers and were snappy when asked questions. I do not recommend this airline at all!,1american-airlines,18/08/14,This is a general review of American Airlines. Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class. Maybe it's because I have so much experience that little things and small delays do not phase me but I have rarely had a problem so bad that I felt the need to contact AA customer service and I've never written a negative review. Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier. But throughout my near-million miles and 14 years flying AA I still recommend the airline to my friends and family to get them anywhere in the world they need to go safely on time and for a reasonable cost.,9american-airlines,18/08/14,I am not picky about the airlines and used to travel by the cheapest deals available. This time I took AA. Flying American Airlines was the worst experience for me. The planes were mostly old and run down. They took 2 hrs to fix the bolt and screws while flying to San Diego on flight AA 49. The staff especially at Dallas boarding desk was rude and changed my seat without an apology. Not only that see was upfront rude. Each flight were at least an hour or 2 late. There are definitely better options and I would not fly this airline again.,1american-airlines,18/08/14,"I was flying from Dublin to JFK NY on July 30 flight 291. I got the impression that serving the needs of the passengers was not a priority. I had reported to a flight attendant about some good amount of water sloshing around in the lavatory. It was slippery and the dirty liquid had got on my shoes and clothing. The flight attendant replied that she did not think the liquid was water and was not going to touch it. I do not understand why it could not have been mopped up. I think is was very inappropriate of the Airline to not train their flight attendants in mopping up unpleasant ""spills"" in the lavatories and providing them the sanitary means of doing so. This was upsetting to me to have to use lavatories with unsanitary conditions on an airline! The American Airline website makes it very difficult to send a complaint to. I think this is very important for them to see this and to correct it. I gave the airline poor ratings and do not plan to fly it again.",1american-airlines,15/08/14,"Flew London Heathrow to JFK. Had transferred from Qatar from JNB-DOH-LHR. This was a bit like going from a fine Hotel (Qatar) to a cheap roadside motel (American). The American Business Class lounge/Admirals Club lounge at LHR beyond the new entrance is simply a dump. Old tired furniture no charm or ambience and an almost complete lack of any kind of decent food or snacks. I saw one tureen of dried up pasta and some pretzels and 2-3 halves of white bread sandwiches. Self serve beverages were somewhat limited with cheap brands of alcohol and ""spouts"" on the wine bottles-a really low class touch. Although the roughly half full business does have a state of the art flat bed seat with decent storage the cabin service was dismal. Pre departure beverages were served in flimsy plastic glasses. Cabin staff attitude throughout the flight was casual and usually indifferent. I slept until approx. 1.5 hours before landing missing the snack service. No a single member of the cabin crew offered to serve it to me later. The rear lavatories were devoid of any cosmetics the forward lavatories were stocked. Of course there were no flowers in the lavatories. Catering was adequate the menu was a tiny card like affair nothing like the elegant and extensive menu presented in a folder on Qatar. I am thoroughly convinced that flying on American or any US Airline on long distance flights is wasting money and accepting poor treatment and it makes more sense to choose non US airlines which offer their premium customers a much higher standard of service.",2american-airlines,15/08/14,JFK-MXP-JFK. Both flights departed a few minutes early and arrived on time. Aircraft was an 'updated' 767-300ER with the new Biz Class and Main Cabin Extra where we were seated. Had the bulkhead seat both ways in this mini MCE cabin of 2 rows which made a difference. Service was ok food below average from JFK but much better from Milan. The only real downer is the lack of personal IFE or streaming IFE on this plane only main screen entertainment was available. Were lucky though to have a professional friendly and warm flight attendant from Milan.,6american-airlines,13/08/14,ORD-MIA-GRU in Economy on July 28. Daylight flight from Miami to Sao Paulo - delayed 4 hours and that is where American failed its passengers. They boarded us and at the departure time they asked us to de-board as the plane has mechanical issues. Ok - fine. They say there is a plane at a gate that will take us to SP and they just need to service the plane. That was a lie - all the passengers got to the gate (and we had been told to take our pillows and blankets as the new plane wouldn't have them) and there was no plane. We sat around for 3 hours before a plane showed up from the hanger where 4 AA 777s sat the whole time. Finally board and take off - 8 hour flight and flight attendants were friendly. Seat comfort is awful - no leg room due to entertainment box at the window. Seat cushion is non-existent so luckly the extra pillow helped (we got on the plane and blankets and pillows were already there). Upon landing in Sao Paulo at 12:10am (4 hours late) we finally got an apology from the flight deck - until then they didn't say a thing about the delay. Come on American - have some respect for the people who pay your bills. I did get an email when I landed with an apology and 5000 AA miles - ok - that's nice. But I felt sorry for the many passengers who missed connecting flights at 12.10am there are no more flights until morning. I had a 2.5 hour drive to Santos and didn't get to my hotel until 3am. When AA does it well - its great. When they fail - its really bad.,7american-airlines,13/08/14,July 31 - CWB-POA-MIA-ORD. 767-300 from CWB to Miami in Business Class. Flight boarded and crew had just come in from Miami. They were awful - no one said hello or offered a drink until just before we departed 45 minutes late to Porto Alegre. I understand they are tired - AA needs to change crew at Curitiba and have a fresh crew all the way to MIA. Landed 30 min behind schedule at POA - had to exit the plane and they gave us new boarding passes and just waited in the gate area for boarding. Little cafe had snacks and flight was packed (in coach - 1/2 full in Biz) so gate area was busy. POA-MIA - excellent service! Flight attendants were so friendly and accommodating. Greeted you by name - were always in the cabin even though the flight leaves POA at 12:05am - with water and snacks. Slept well and had a quick breakfast before landing in Miami. Aborted landing due to some warning light in the cockpit but did a fly around and landed safely. A really nice flight once we got the new crew at POA. This is the type of service that makes AA stand out.,8american-airlines,13/08/14,JFK to LHR. AA's problems are no longer the fleet its old tired flight attendants that should be in bed rather than serving passengers paying up to $6000 for a business class seat with an attitude and a lack of respect that is simply unacceptable. Other passengers complained as well. Just impersonal and rude service on AA104. American needs to ground those FA's that are older and with attitude. Hire younger FA's that want to do their job rather than complaining to passengers about how the airlines have changed and how what we pay for the seats isn't worth it. After 33 years I'm not flying AA anymore. Ill go BA or anything other than an American carrier. They just honestly are awful now and I see no change due to them being union. Fly a foreign carrier. You'll see the difference.,3american-airlines,13/08/14,We flew from Shreveport LA to DFW. We then flew from Dallas to London. Neither plane left on time or got us there on time. We had people waiting in London. Same happened on the way back. On the way back we were shuttled to British Airways. Got to Dallas had a six hour layover. Because British Airways was late getting us to Dallas the layover was five hours. We sat in the airport in Dallas for 4.5 hours at the gate we were supposed to leave from. Twenty minutes before the plane was to leave from Dallas the gate was changed and we had to run to get to the new gate. I have come to the conclusion that American Airlines doesn't care at all about their customers. For the prices people are charged for tickets and fees you would think service would be better. Won't fly American again.,1american-airlines,06/08/14,My husband and I recently flew American first class from SFO through DFW to SDF. This was a last minute change from a ticket on another airline that allows cancellations without penalty because we found our outbound trip to be somewhat stressful. We are delighted we made the change. The one way fare was very reasonable and the service was superior. The SFO to DFW leg was on a wifi equipped 737. We were in seats 3F and 4F and both of us had plenty of legroom and the seats were very comfortable. Entertainment was Rio 2 which we didn't watch because we were reading (and eating). Breakfast for me was granola fruit salad orange juice coffee and a hot biscuit with jam. I am a southern girl and take pride in my own biscuits and I have to say the AA version was excellent. The other choice was a strata with muffin which my husband also found quite tasty the flight attendant passed the muffin/biscuit basket a couple of times but we were too full to partake. At the end of the flight she stopped by each seat and thanked us for flying American. The DFW to SDF leg was on an A312 which was quiet (a little noisy on takeoff) and sturdy. In flight entertainment choice (personal TV) was excellent - many movies TV and music channels to choose from. The snack was also quite good - I had a salad with poached chicken quinoa asparagus and arugula with a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. Husband had an open-faced turkey/tomato/gruyere sandwich on fresh bread with a macadamia nut cookie. He also had a tumbler of red wine I had a diet Pepsi (they also offer Coke products). The flight attendant was also quite attentive and spoke with us by name. We felt very well taken care of.,9american-airlines,06/08/14,On my MIA-LHR leg I flew the 777-200 which is an awful configuration 2-3-2. What a lovely surprise on the way back to fly a 777-300 with a great configuration of 1-2-1. I was by the window great. Upgraded seat and a great crew to complement it. Wish AA would get rid of the 2-3-2 configuration in business - pathetic.,6american-airlines,06/08/14,July 31 we were on flight 3143 NAS to MIA. Flight was scheduled to take off at 605. We were on the runway on time when a passenger became ill. We returned to the terminal. They left her on board until a paramedic arrived to check her out. At this point she felt better and wanted to continue but had to wait until someone from headquarters arrived to determine if it was safe for her to stay on the flight. They took her off the plane then allowed her to return then took her off again. Every person on that plane had a connecting flight to catch. They then had to refuel the plane. We then got back on the runway then had to go back to check out a maintenance issue. We sat there another 30 minutes. Then we had to get off the plane while they worked on it. At 9.30 we boarded again then had to wait for a passenger who couldn't decide whether or not to continue. We finally left NAS at 10 pm. When we landed in MIA we had to go back through customs find our luggage then try to find someone from AA to help us all reschedule flights. No one from AA was available to help us until after 11 pm. They put us up overnight at a local hotel and rescheduled all our flights for the next day but it was a very poorly handled situation. I do not plan to use AA in the future. We have used other airlines many times and have had issues but never anything handled this poorly.,1american-airlines,06/08/14,I have been an airline passenger for the past 60 years. All types of planes to all types of destinations with all types of carriers. The golden years you might say when the flights were not only comfortable but fun and even riotous at times! The service food and drinks (especially the drinks) were an integral and indispensable part of the experience. It is sad to see what was once a wonderful and exciting experience reduced to the level of a bus ride and a damn uncomfortable bus ride at that! Flight AA121 Paris (CDG) to New York (JFK) July 2nd 2014 gave a glimmer of hope. The cabin crew were experienced co-ordinated pleasant and most helpful.,5american-airlines,06/08/14,We flew from LHR-JFK with AA101 in economy I also had low expectations about reading several reviews here on the website. Strangely enough it was a nice and overall experience with AA. B777-300 the cabin looks fresh and airy. The stewards and stewardesses ages were no lower than 50 years but the steward on duty on my aisle was very friendly. Food was ok we had a choice between chicken or pasta (no menu distributed) and an hour before arrival they distributed hot pizza and in between several rounds of drinks. Flight departed on time and arrived in JFK almost right on time. Overall experience was better than expected and I'll fly them again!,9american-airlines,03/08/14,"We paid for 6 business class tickets from Zurich via London to Dallas. Then 4 business class tickets from Los Angeles to London to Zurich. I've never seen a more consistent disgruntled group of employees in all of the years I've flown overseas. Where to begin? We chose American because of the ""New"" business class. We were given an old plane. My family is very low maintenance. We only ask for simple respect. We are mid flight and AA cancels our connection from Dallas to Grand Junction. 10 hours before we are to board. We don't get the notification until we reach our gate to fly to Grand Junction. No effort on AA part at all to help us. No hotel no car service. We make our own arrangements. This may seem small but by this point we are exhausted. Any help at all by AA would have been appreciated. Our return trip. I went for more water I was told they only had the large bottles. If I wanted more water I could bring my small empty water bottle up and refill it. Not how can I help you? Not can I bring the water to you? They stand there chatting while I try to refill my bottle.",1american-airlines,02/08/14,JFK-LAX return in F on the new A321 transcon product. American has really upped their game here. The hard product is outstanding in terms of privacy comfort and durability. Feels very exclusive and closer to the luxury that Asian and some European carriers are offering in long haul configurations. Outbound check-in was prompt although not very helpful with navigating the chaos that was security at JFK T8. Onboard service was exceedingly professional albeit not intrusive but that's the way I like it. Purser kept a watchful eye on the 10 pax in the cabin and was very prompt with drink refills or any other needs. Food was above expectations and in fact quite tasty. Could have a better champagne for first class (it is in fact not a real champagne but a domestic sparkling wine) but that's a first world problem of course. Pillow and blanket provided were of good quality could use a mattress pad for overnight flights. On the return check in at LAX Flagship was quick and friendly brought to the front of the security line which was nice. Can't comment on onboard service on the return because once we hit 10000 feet I put the seat into bed mode and slept a complete four and a half hours of solid sleep waking just before descent. This is a first for me in over 25 years of travel. For that reason alone I fully commend this product. It's a game changer for the NY-LA market.,10american-airlines,02/08/14,I recently flew with AA and US Airways from New York Boston and Washington DC. I cannot believe that American Airlines is part of the One World Alliance. When you look at the level of service you get from world class airlines like Qantas Cathay Pacific and LAN and then see the pathetic offering you get from AA I am dumbstruck. As a frequent Australian traveller I absolutely hate having to use AA anytime. Their Admirals Club lounges are truly pathetic - paying for food and pseudo-snacks like pretzels and plastic wrapped muffins. AA passengers who fly Qantas and use the Qantas Club lounges must be amazed. The service on AA is uniformly awful and rude. How can Americans put up with such an array of shocking airline companies. Now that AA have bought US Airways it will be doubly bad.,1american-airlines,02/08/14,My flight out of Chicago was delayed for hours and then cancelled at 1am. Understandable taking into consideration Chicago weather. However it was the customer service received during and after this that convinced me to end my days as an American Airlines flyer. I spent the next few hours on hold with customer service trying to get my flight rebooked. After 3.5 hours on hold I booked a flight for the following morning through the AA website to ensure that I would return home on time. The next morning unable once again to contact customer service I boarded the flight and made it home in time to return to work. Only after I finally contacted customer service did I learn that I had in fact been booked on a rescheduled flight. I searched my inbox spam and trash but had received no sort of email or notification of the rescheduling. If I had been informed of this flight or been able to contact customer service I could have foregone the cost of a second flight and avoided all of the frustrating cold emails that have taken place since.,1american-airlines,31/07/14,DFW to PDX - the service was terrible. First the price: it was $360 round-trip non-stop. While this may sound like a good deal it was not too long ago that American wanted $500 for the same trip. I could go to Europe one- way for that! The price drop is the only reason why I give them 2 out of 5 stars for value. If it weren't for that I would give them one-star without a second thought. Second the lines for baggage check were long. Apparently this airline does not realize that it's 2014: I was completely unable to pay my baggage fee online and there was no fast check-in option either. So I had to wait in line to do something I could have done online with other air carriers and only takes five minutes at most with other ones. Third the seats. They were harder than rocks with virtually no leg room with my messenger bag below the seat in front of me. It was virtually impossible to sleep or rest in my seat. When I got off the plane I was very sore. The flight attendants did not care about my experience and the check-in agents flat out ignored me at PDX. Lastly when I emailed American with a complaint about these issues I got the most sarcastic response I have ever got from a customer service representative. In conclusion I never plan on flying American again. I'd rather have a stop (or two!) than fly them.,2american-airlines,31/07/14,We had a really good flight with a very nice and obliging crew! Food was very good also the entertainment program and the seats. We will always fly with AA again!,9american-airlines,29/07/14,I will never fly AA again. The Miami staff were very rude and not accommodating at all. Flight was late leaving from Turks and Caicos and staff failed to announce the delay by half an hour. Therefore I missed my connecting flight in Miami to LGA. Miami Staff were not accommodating. I had an older aunt with me and I asked for a wheelchair twice it never came. AA staff had no sense of direction or didn't speak enough English - it was terrible! Never again.,3american-airlines,29/07/14,LHR-JFK. I had low expectations due to reviews posted here. I was therefore happy to discover that the plane was new (and/or very clean) seats were comfortable flight attendants warm and friendly. The flight was full and the flight attendants graciously offered passengers the option to spread out so that we can be comfortable. Meals were hot and nicely prepared. IFE was varied and up to date WiFi available on board but not free. The pilot was very pleasant in his announcements that I didn't mind the delay in landing/parking due to the rains in NY. It seems AA is starting to up its game starting with international flights. Will most probably fly AA again in the future.,8american-airlines,29/07/14,"Let me start by saying I am a regular business flier and travel frequently although because of issues like the following complaint usually only fly AA as a last resort. On a recent trip from LGA to DFW AA forced me to gate- check my same standard 22in. carry-on bag which I take on every flight on every other airline. The bag clearly fit within the test box when I had to test it the first time going through the security checkpoint and similarly fit again when forced to test it at the gate but because the agent said I had to ""push"" it down to fit within the box it was too big and had to be checked. When I boarded the plane I was frustrated to see that the bag would have easily fit within the overhead compartment. Maybe AA has smaller jets with smaller overhear storage capacity than every other major airline. This was a big inconvenience and was easily avoidable and I will continue to avoid flying on AA whenever possible.",2american-airlines,29/07/14,The boarding passes we printed out at DFW Airport showed that the flight from DFW to TYR originally scheduled at 6pm was delayed to 8pm. We still went to the gate to see if the delay was changed. The monitor showed that the flight was delayed to 8pm. After we returned to the gate at 7pm we were told the flight left at 6.30. There was no more flights from DFW to TYR afterwards. The assistant checked us in for the 9.00 flight the next day. When we requested whether there was a voucher for a hotel we were told no. We called the customer service and were blamed for not listening to the announcements. We had to rent a car to return home and drove back to DFW next day to return the rental car. Each person was trying to shift the responsibility away to somebody else. If they made profits by charging passengers more and providing less service whats to celebrate?,2american-airlines,29/07/14,Flight AA1018 DUS-LHR on 5/6/2014 onboard N936NN (B738). Flight was on time and smooth. Food and drinks to buy. Crew were typically American and not that friendly. Legroom was adequate but no more.,6american-airlines,27/07/14,From LA to Chicago on 22nd June on American Airlines. Perfect service from staff at the airport to FA's on the plane. I have read a lot of bad reviews on this website but can only say my husband and I found our flight more than we expected. Our luggage was delayed for about an hour but this was I believe only due to two planes arriving at the same time.,7american-airlines,27/07/14,Flight from Germany to Charlotte NC to Huntsville AL in 05/2014 was the worst flight experience. TV screen did not work staff was not concerned after numerous requests. The aircraft had a malfunction before takeoff in NC delaying us 3 hours on the taxiway. This caused a missed flight at the connection stop. American did not care whatsoever and we had to ask to get a meal voucher but that was all that was given. They would only put us on another American flight that left hours later putting us home in the middle of the night and needed to be at work the next morning. Worst airline ever. This review only covers about 65% of the issues experienced.,1american-airlines,27/07/14,LHR-MIA-LHR. It is some time since I have flown AA transatlantic after many years of having previously done so when both the hard and soft products were truly appalling. This choice came about as a result of the fare being two-thirds of the next best so difficult to ignore. Both sectors were by B77W equipment with the new Business Class configuration. This is a vast improvement. The cabin crew actually seemed to enjoy being there (almost) although the sole male cabin crew member in Business on the return flight was extremely obnoxious. Food was ok- ish and whilst I had chosen my entrees on-line for both sectors there was no record on board of any of my selections. The cabin crew told me that this on-line facility was a complete waste of time as it never worked. Overall AA was better than my recollection of many years before but hard product apart it continues to be still a long way behind the alternatives.,7american-airlines,27/07/14,Booked flights for the husband and I from BOS to MIA in October. Received an email changing our flight times and seats after we had purchased and selected. Threw us off the original time and put another flight number in its place. Had no reasonable explanation other than they are re-figuring their planes! Really messed up our departure for sure. The planes are so old and dirty. Couldn't even use the bathroom as it was filthy on our last flight. The attendants were miserable! TV monitors were from the dark ages not to mention the inside condition of the plane. It was falling apart from the inside. Could see the outer shell from my seat! Charge megabucks for low class experience.,1american-airlines,27/07/14,MIA-BOG-MIA. Both sectors were flown by very tired B752s with equally tired cabin crews. I have been flying these sectors along with other Latin routes with (Latin) American Airlines which bears little resemblance to AA mainline for some 25 years on the same aircraft type with the same take-it or leave-it cabin crew attitudes. Wifi and in-flight power is heavily advertised on these aircraft but were not available on either sector. Both aircraft and cabin crew are in need of a substantial refresh.,4american-airlines,22/07/14,Will never fly AA again. The experience at Dallas was terrible. Flight was late therefore missed flight. Boarded another flight but told to get off due to mechanical problem. Very little information on what to do next. Sent to four different gates. Treated like cattle. Never made it out that day and no guarantee to fly next day. Forced to go to a different airport and buy another ticket on Southwest. No apologies by AA personnel. Customer service was the worst I've experienced in over 50 years of traveling.,1american-airlines,22/07/14,I travelled American Airlines on Flight AA55 from Manchester UK to Chicago. This was an awful flight. The aircraft had no in seat entertainment the seats were old and uncomfortable the headrests hardly lifted above the seat so for a taller person the backrest sticks in your back. In addition the staff were at best terse at worst indifferent. I can only believe they are as fed up as I was being stuck on that aircraft. On the bright side it arrived on time overall however it was a prime example of a truly budget flight the only thing is I paid a lot of money for the flight. I only went this route because I needed to go to Chicago never again.,1american-airlines,22/07/14,I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.,1american-airlines,20/07/14,Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either. I will never fly AA again.,1american-airlines,17/07/14,Flew from LAX to JFK on AA292 in First Class 14th July. A very good experience on a brand new plane an A321. The seat makes the flight as it converts to a fully lie flat bed and I was able to get a few hours of sleep after having a nice hot breakfast. Good inflight entertainment amenity kit and a great cabin crew who seemed happy to be there. Well done AA!,10american-airlines,17/07/14,ORD-SEA first class. Standard first class seats. Nothing special but comfortable. Lunch was surprisingly good. Glad we pre-selected the beef dish. Decent selection of beer and wine. Still don't like the fact that buying a domestic first class ticket doesn't get us into the airline's airline's club but this is standard at least among U.S. airlines.,7american-airlines,17/07/14,HKG-DFW. Check-in: no online check-in for some reason had to do it at the airport. Good no problem. Boarding: for all US-bound flights they had to search all our hand-carry bags for water/liquids and they do it in the middle of the bridge where the air isn't moving very well and warm. I don't understand why can't they do it right before scanning the boarding pass. The bridge area is small not a smart idea at all. I feel bad for those in a long line for the economy class. In-flight: Food/meals are very good no complaints there. The seat is excellent with lie-flat bed and big screen monitor. One problem there were several movies/TV shows that are shown available but couldn't get to it. Other than that slept well and services were fine.,7american-airlines,17/07/14,"Just flew on Sunday 7/13 on AA's new 777-300 International configuration in business class. I have to say that it was the very first time I have felt that a US carrier competed effectively with front rank international carriers. The seat was excellent. The overall quality of the seat was superior given the amenities screen etc. Just the slightest bit less comfortable than BA's flat seat but not a huge different. The overall seat was superior to anyone else's business class I have been on. The food and beverage service was excellent. Appetizing decent portions well served and proper temperature. Inflight entertainment options are excellent. Beats the angled ""lie flat"" seat on the 767's and older triple 7's. You got it right this time. Even the crew was not as grouchy as AA flight crews have become. Actually I was very pleased.",8american-airlines,15/07/14,Had a 6 part trip this month on AA. Every leg had issues. Mechanical problems abound due to the age of the fleet. Arrived at JFK for the vacation portion of this trip and was told at the first class check in that our aircraft was removed from service and we would be 6 hours delayed departing. We missed our first day of vacation and a party because of this. Bottom line you can't rely on this company to get you where you are going in any reliable way. Also have issues with their website frequently down lack of communication with flight delays also.,1american-airlines,15/07/14,Just flew 4 domestic sectors LAX-DFW-OMA and DSM-DFW-LAX. Ex LAX boarded on time but then due to weather in DFW were delayed for roughly 2 hours. Informed of delay by Captain and given updates. Once underway beverage service given inflight video shown. Overnight in DFW then to OMA next day. Flight delayed due to mechanical issues. Passengers allowed off plane after first hour cabin crew offered juice and water then granola bars. Flight cancelled after 4 hours. $12 refreshment vouchers given. Replacement aircraft and eventually got away about 5.5 hours late. Whilst this was an inconvenience I believe the staff acted properly keeping passengers informed and making alternate arrangements. Return flight I requested baggage to be checked through to SYD which took some time to organise due to booking problems caused by the earlier delay when I had been taken off the delayed flights but then reinstated. Only complaint was during this time our pre-assigned seats were given away and we were given seats at the back of the aircraft without the additional leg room. All things considered I was happier to have bags checked through and less legroom. I have been critical of AA in the past but thus trip they receive full marks.,7american-airlines,13/07/14,I had not flown AA for a few years and now I know why. AA employees sat in first class on a very early flight from TPA-MIA and spoke loudly to one another while the other first class passengers tried to sleep. Had a 7.40pm flight from MIA-TPA but paid a $75 plane change fee to take the 5.50pm flight. No problem there except for the fact that the plane flight 986 from STT-MIA had an alarm mishap and they had to call a maintenance personnel from off-site. He was very late so therefore missed the earlier connection at 5.50pm from MIA-TPA and took my original flight at 7.40pm-no compensation returned for their error. Other members in my party had first class on the 5.50pm flight and did not receive it when we were all booked on the 7.40pm flight. They did attempt to put us all together but placed us in the exit row with two children traveling under the age of 15. Therefore the kids had to sit in other areas in the plane and were scared to sit alone. Upon a later arrival to TPA at 8.40pm AA/US AIR misplaced our luggage and was it was all still sitting in Miami with Priority tags on them. So much for priority as they turned up a day and a half later.,1american-airlines,13/07/14,Providenciales - Miami: AA300. Miami - Paris: AA62. Both flights on old aircraft in particular the flight from Miami to Paris was dreadful on an old 767. No AVOD or individual screen. The seats were the most uncomfortable I have experienced. Food was tasteless and bland with portions quite small. Drinks service was decent but really that was all with the flight that was a positive. Staff seemed disinterested and tired during the flight. First and last time I fly with AA.,2american-airlines,13/07/14,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection.",1american-airlines,08/07/14,ORD-JFK/LGA-ORD - July 2-5. I keep seeing a huge increase in great attitudes from flight attendants on AA flights. Very personable and fun on both flights. Departed ORD on-time and landed at JFK early - but taxied around JFK for 30 minutes before getting to our gate. Dinner served was pre-ordered on aa.com and the chicken was very tasty. Return to ORD from LGA - plane was only 60% full and the three flight attendants (DCA-based) were having a great time with everyone. Lots of talking laughing with passengers and very personable. Good dinner served and landed 40 minutes early into ORD. I see a lot of negative reports for AA but I wonder if people are just expecting too much or are exaggerating their issues. Keep up the good work AA!,8american-airlines,08/07/14,One month travel itinerary June 10 - July 8. Point here is not as much about inconvenience as how situations are handled. 4 flights cancelled. One due to weather. Paid upgrades are not refunded if flights cancelled per AA reservations. After 3.5 hour wait little or no information given to waiting passengers in cancellation of first leg OGG-LAX. Restaurant employees saw flight crew leave airport. AA would only help passengers with connections. The rest of us scrambled for flights. Locating luggage was a whole other mishap. 2.5 hr flight from QRO-DFW turned into a 10 hour flight touching down in 2 cities to refuel. Water was being rationed. Children first. No food. No offers from ground crews for additional water or even peanuts. No help with connecting flights. No enough cots in airport Terribly mishandled. Connecting flight missed but cancelled anyway. MCI-OGG delayed 4 hours. Equipment not available. Automated message via phone at 2.30 am for 7.30 am flight. Was auto rebooked on flight out a day later. Called and obtained same day departure. Hoping I get out. Remember when flying used to be fun and airlines treated us with courtesy? Note: Have flown all other US carriers AA is cheaper but savings offset by delay costs incurred other problems and poor treatment.,1american-airlines,08/07/14,"I flew from Ontario CA to Indianapolis IN by way of Dallas TX (round-trip). All 4 planes were MD-80's - I probably don't need to say much more. These planes should have been taken out of service 10 years ago. I was flying them in the early 90's from ORD to LAX they needed to be retired back then. All 4 flights were delayed because of mechanical problems (ranging from inoperative toilets to loose electrical panels). All 4 planes were filthy - not just the rest rooms and aisles - but the seats windows and tray tables were disgusting. All 4 flights were full - so as we sat on the planes waiting for the ""maintenance issues"" to be resolved we roasted. Given that I had a similar experience on a trip from Palm Springs to Cleveland (round trip 4 flight segments) in April on American I should have known better. But as a ""loyal rewards member"" I booked this last flight on American too - hoping for better equipment and on time service. At this point I don't even expect any aspect of comfort on American flights - I just want a safe plane that lands reasonably on time. Given the last 8 flights that I flew on American planes in the last 90 days I'm not even certain that the old MD-80's are safe anymore. When 6 out of 8 of my flights were delayed for mechanical or maintenance issues I begin to wonder I'm going to start building my miles on United. I'm done with American. P.S. - during the last 20 years I have been ""Gold"" ""Platinum"" and in the ""Concierge Key"" program - so I have witnessed the decline of this airline's quality and on- time performance first-hand.",1american-airlines,08/07/14,Flight #7943 from Honolulu to Los Angeles April 25 2014. This airline is terrible. The only reason to choose this airline is that they have so many flights to so many locations. But it is as if they don't like to be in flight service. Both my husband and I have been regular flight passengers for most of our adult lives for business and pleasure. Over the years AA has not improved on any level of their service. Since going online for booking we have yet to have reservation that isn't botched in some way. I am sitting on AA plane as I write this as we wait after flying 5.5 hours for a gate to become available. Though this may be an airport error the connections between flights is so short that many passengers are in threat of missing there next flight. We almost missed our connecting to this flight because only 30 minutes was allotted between flights. I would gladly pay more for better service and have but AA has only increased its prices but not improved the quality of service.,2american-airlines,08/07/14,"Pensacola to San Francisco. After paying full fare for a toddler in a seat my pregnant daughter was treated so inconsiderately by American Airlines staff that none of us will ever fly with this airline again. No pre-board because ""there are too many children on this flight"" and they took her stroller away so that she had to carry 2 bags and the child. On one leg of the flight they gave her back the stroller last and nearly made her miss her connection. There is no compassion from this airline!",1american-airlines,06/07/14,Paris to Boston on an old and uncomfortable 757. The worst international business class seat I've ever had. Did anyone from American try sitting in this seat before they selected it? Small personal video screen with terrible resolution and limited choice of films. Food was inedible. The only good about this flight was the crew - friendly and hard working. Luggage took 40 minutes to unload. Overall a terrible experience.,1american-airlines,06/07/14,We will never fly with this airline again. Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there. We finally get a plane and find out from the flight attendant the delay was caused because there was no ramp at their last stop. The pilots did an awesome job getting us to Dallas on time. But then we sat for over an hour waiting to get to a gate. By this time everyone's connecting flights should have left. But we run across the Dallas airport and find out our connecting flight is delayed as well. Seems we didn't have a crew. What a joke. Never again.,1american-airlines,06/07/14,"I recently flew from Miami to London. Sat in the economy class. Seat was extremely narrow designed for very slim person. I am 185lbs and 5'11"". For me the seat was very uncomfortable. If you are a large person recommend to buy 2 seats or avoid flying economy. The cabin was very claustrophobic. There was a big wall in front. The quality and the quantity of the food was pathetic. Inedible unless you were real hungry. This airline lowered their standards tremendously. I used 50000 points and paid $68 for this one way flight. In monetary terms approx $700. If the airlines do not stop abusing their passenger I personally will give up long distance flying.",1american-airlines,06/07/14,We recently took our family to Maui to celebrate our 48th anniversary. My husband is in his 70's as I am and he has Parkinson's disease. I have recently had a knee replacement so we rented a hotel for the park and fly program as did our daughter's family for a total of $475 so there would be no chance of us being late for our plane which was to leave at 10.35 am. We arrived early as were told to do. Eventually we found that there was a delay of at least 30 minutes. The delay continued to be extended and ended up being a 9 hour wait. AA reps told us there was nothing they could do. The seats are firm plastic with no head rest or place to lean against the wall. We were given a lunch voucher which we used but were never offered a dinner voucher. We became more and more frustrated as time progressed. We finally left for a long flight to Maui with a crew who were unhappy to called out on Father's Day on an unexpected flight. Their attitude reflected that. We were not given anything to compensate for all our problems no free drinks no food. Nothing. We got to our hotel at 3.30 am. On our trip home we were held up because someone had thrown up in the seat but it wasn't cleaned up by the cleaning crew. There was vomit on the seats and in the buckle making it necessary to take off all seat covering and taking out and putting in all new seatbelt apparatus. To top this all off we are AA frequent flyers!,1american-airlines,06/07/14,What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful. It is a throwback to the 1990s.,3american-airlines,01/07/14,I recently booked a 9.30am trip to Amarillo through American Airlines (booked it 2 months in advance). The morning of the flight at about 6.30am (while I was headed to the airport) I was called by American Airlines and it was an automated voice recording telling me that my flight had been cancelled and they automatically put me on a 6.30pm flight that night. I had no option to talk to anyone or hear a reasoning on the scenario that was taking place. I had to call back and go through various automated conversations until I finally reached someone. After explaining the situation (and no sympathy was shown) I realized the person could not help me and did not desire to help me. Little did she know I had major wedding events to get to at my destination (hints why I booked an early flight in the first place). I ended up having to book another flight through Southwest Airlines last minute (costing me a fortune) just to make it to the city in time. It was an all around awful experience dealing with an impersonal system that left me without answers paying a fortune and still arriving later than I planned. I will never again try to fly American Airlines.,1american-airlines,01/07/14,On our return flight from Orlando to DFW we arrived early to the massive lines at security. Got through and sat down for an early dinner flight delayed. Took our time then another notice flight delayed again. Finally left dinner and walked around got to out terminal flight delayed again. So our 7pm take off was now leaving at 9pm. Sat down and watched TV. Then some people started standing up and getting upset flight now delayed until 11.45pm. Our plane arrived but had to wait on a crew to fly us. Finally got on the plane after midnight and waited another hour on the plane. We were told we might not have enough fuel. Really? The plane had been there at the airport for 3 hours and no one checked to refuel it? Got back to DFW at 2.30am. Only one baggage person there at that time and several bags were missing. 30 minutes waiting to get our bag that came in at an early flight. So 8 hours in the airport and all the explanation we got was it was DFW's fault. Never again.,1american-airlines,30/06/14,I was on a round trip Miami to Buenos Aires in business class. I read reviews about the service and aircraft (767-300) being substandard. However I found the seats to be reasonably comfortable and the service by the Buenos Aires based crew was very nice.,9american-airlines,25/06/14,Narita - LAX June 25 First Class. A totally acceptable experience except for boarding and off loading. See my previous review for service comments. Boarding for a First class really needs an upgrade first class passengers deserve more. LAX arrival was unacceptable. Remote gate (ok that happens) but first class passengers were herded onto a packed bus for the ride to terminal. Come on not even a special bus for first and business pax? Not a way to get or keep premium passengers.,7american-airlines,23/06/14,June 15-19 supposed to depart from Knoxville to Dallas to Las Vegas but were made to drive from Knoxville to Nashville. Route ended up being Nashville to Dallas to Las Vegas and vice versa. Our flight was changed several times by the airline before departure date. On the date of departure we received an automated phone call 3 hours before take off notifying us that our plane was delayed 4 hours. This interfered with our connecting flight and there was not another flight that would have us reaching our destination until the next day. I contacted the airline immediately and they confirmed that if they re-routed us we could reach our destination. We agreed to this and proceeded to the airport. Upon arrival we were unable to check in. An hour later it was discovered that when re-routing us the person had neglected to issue us a ticket and now our flight was over booked. Our only option was to drive 2.5 hours to another airport catch a flight there and then have 15 minutes between connecting flights that we were to try and get to the gate and board in time. Somehow we managed to make it and made it to our destination. On our return trip we again couldn't check in and had to see an attendant. Everyone we encountered was extremely rude and hateful. I will never fly American Airlines again.,1american-airlines,23/06/14,If you're looking for a company that will fly you in the least comfort at the highest price then look no further â€“ you found it. It is inconceivable that American Airlines are still flying old planes with no individual entertainment systems on their transatlantic crossing and charging more than anyone else for the privilege. They didn't even show the film they advertised. We only flew from JFK to Buffalo (with a rival company) a flight of just over an hour and they had individual entertainment screens. To add insult to injury AA ran an ad telling us all how they are adding a new plane every week to their fleet! All I can say is watch out AA when Thomson starts flying the Dreamliner from Manchester to JFK in May 2015 I do not predict a very prosperous future for them.,1american-airlines,20/06/14,LHR-MIA 11 June 777-300ER in Main Cabin Extra. I read a lot of complaints about American but it is an American airline serving American tastes. It has no desire to compete with the significantly better Asian and Mid East airlines and it would seem quite happy with its 3-star rating. So don't expect too much! Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight. The service was prompt and efficient the food acceptable and staff were present throughout the flight. Take off and landing were about on time. Be nice keep your expectations reasonable and its ok.,8american-airlines,20/06/14,I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes. Needless to say after these experiences I will never fly this airline again.,1american-airlines,20/06/14,MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight. I did.,8american-airlines,17/06/14,LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films. Breakfast was plentiful and really fresh. Sorry to get off at LHR!,9american-airlines,13/06/14,We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets defective lavatories inflight entertainment was broken reading lights did not work fresh air vents that would not open or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.,1american-airlines,13/06/14,June 12 AA169 LAX-NRT F Class. Nowadays one has quite high expectations for International First Class while adequate American met none of those expectations. On all levels it met international business class standards and no more. Cabin crew was friendly but not very visible between meals. Better off in business on JAL United Singapore or even Delta. Quite a let down.,4american-airlines,13/06/14,June 11 2014 flight 1322 Liberia Costa Rica to MIA. Worst experience ever! On our return aircraft had an engine problem delayed flight for 4 hours missed connecting flight in MIA to NYC because of this issue. Arrived at MIA at 12am and next flight was at 6am upon leaving same engine issue flight delayed 2 more hours. On top of the fact that their aircraft's are not inspected they offer no food not even a bag of chips and there's no wifi even though they say they provide it. I travel twice every year will never fly with them again!,1american-airlines,12/06/14,I just completed a multi city international round trip with American. 2 international flights and 3 domestic. So the international (from South America to Miami) was an overnight flight. The plane was old and the ceiling TVs stayed on all night. No sleep. All of my domestic flights were either delayed re-routed or cancelled. The first from Tampa to DFW was cancelled due to no oxygen. To top it off at my final destination back in South America one bag was delayed (hopefully not lost) as it was accidentally put on a LAN flight to Lima. 5 days later I am still waiting for it.,1american-airlines,12/06/14,"I flew from Manchester Airport to JFK in economy class. From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"". After booking with BA I was disappointed to find AA codeshare and operate the flight as I was not prepared for the awful aircraft used the lack of IFE the poor quality food and the stunningly nasty approach by the cabin crew. Would never choose or recommend this airline.",1american-airlines,09/06/14,We started in BWI with 4 delays totalling 4 hours. We finally made it to DFW and have been sitting on tarmac for almost a half hour now just a perfect end to horrible trip with AA. Tried calling customer service with a seat issue before flight and the woman hung up on me. I actually got 2 voice messages on the first 2 delays. I will not fly AA again.,1american-airlines,08/06/14,We booked a quick weekend round trip from MIA to ORD and the trip went very well! We had requested wheelchair service both ways and they were on time and very professional. From the counter staff to the flight crew Thank you for your professionalism and courtesy.,10american-airlines,08/06/14,Upon arrival at DFW airport my flight was supposed to depart at 10.20 pm. The flight was delayed several times and finally canceled at 12.00 am. Hotels were not offered the only option was to sleep in the airport. The next flight to my destination was scheduled for 7.30 am the following morning. At 7.20 am the next morning we learned that they had no pilot for the flight delayed again. I am very dissatisfied with AA customer service and I will no longer be flying with this company.,1american-airlines,05/06/14,Flew ORD-MIA on April 20th. The overall experience was very average. We flew American with miles and because United's flights to South Florida are infrequent and poorly timed and AA has a lot more options. All crew that I encountered didn't seem like they cared. The flight arrived on time and bags were waiting that the carousel. The aircraft flown was a 737-800 and the seats were surprisingly comfortable. Wifi was very good and it was only 7 or 8 dollars. The north terminal at Miami is very long and if you are making a connection allot extra time.,6american-airlines,05/06/14,"I just took this trip in fact I arrived back home last night. The trip out: went online to get boarding passes had to choose my seats (two flights). I chose my seat for the first flight no problem. Chose my seat for the second flight: $28 later I had both boarding passes. Silly me I expected when I bought my ticket that I would have a seat without paying extra not so I was in a so called ""upgrade"" seat which I didn't ask for nor did I want but that was all that was left. I did not get anything extra for having paid for a so called ""upgraded"" seat. I had to do the same thing on the return trip. Also you have to pay for your luggage. On the return trip I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 which was most definitely the worst sandwich I have ever had. I will fly Southwest when in need of a flight you purchase a fare from them you not only have a seat that you don't have to pay extra for your first bag is free.",5american-airlines,05/06/14,I normally fly Southwest exclusively - so you can imagine the culture shock when I found myself booked (by my company) on an American flight from SFO to JFK. The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor. Between that and the leg rest I was able to get a little sleep on the way home. There was no indication of how to use the video screen in front of me or any explanation of how to operate the headphone (where the jack was located etc.) or anything. I stopped flying American about 12 years ago and now I remember why.,3american-airlines,05/06/14,JFK-LHR-JFK on BA return on code share AA flight on a new 777-300 so opportunity to compare the two airlines. The seats on AA far more comfortable than on BA greater privacy with 1-2-1 configuration free access without having to step over the neighboring passenger plus all seats facing forward something I never liked on BA set up with window seats facing backward. Inflight entertainment beats BA in every respect screens double the size appeared to be HD greater choice of movies. Food was delicious well presented good choice of wines. Ice cream sundae elevated the meal to a guilty decadence. Overall great experience and highly recommended.,9american-airlines,04/06/14,LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.,1american-airlines,02/06/14,Upon checking in at my starting location I was informed by the AA rep that my flight was being delayed an hour to leave for O'Hare which was a problem as my connecting flight was to leave an hour and 10 minutes after arriving at O'Hare which turned into one mess up after another which would have had me reaching my final destination 2.5+ hrs after scheduled. I reached O'Hare (more delays) and eventually walked out of the airport and took a charter bus reaching my destination before the flight even left Chicago! Avoid American Airlines travelers.,1american-airlines,01/06/14,"MIA to LGA flight. It started with a mechanical problem with the plane's intercom which they spent 2 hours trying to fix before looking for another plane. Another plane found boarded and headed to the runway around 7pm. We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead. Nothing positive to say about this airline. To be avoided if at all possible.",1american-airlines,01/06/14,Business Class trip Tokyo to Dallas. Attendants were rude! It was 45 minutes after take off before we were given audio headsets and 45 minutes before landing they gathered them up. My husband's didn't work and it was a chore to get a replacement pair. We felt like we were intruding on their day! Beverage service was a joke. This was a 12 hour flight and we were given beverages 4 times. We flew first class on various Asian airlines and the service was excellent. I will not fly American again!,7american-airlines,01/06/14,I've been flying for over 30 years and I have never come close to missing a flight. In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am. I've got no apologies form the company and was left with missing our afternoon in Washington.,1american-airlines,01/06/14,May 30 - AA90 daytime flight ORD-LHR. 767-300. Boarding delayed as 15 min before scheduled departure the plane was just coming to the gate. Gate agents were horrible - that is the only part of the trip that was bad. Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late. Bags were already there when we got out of immigration. Good flight and service. The Purser was amazing also - helping out in both cabins and very friendly.,8american-airlines,29/05/14,American is the worst airline I have been on. I'm sitting in the plane after boarding in Chicago having to de- board due to an oil leak after 30 minutes waiting the maintenance have the all clear took off then the pilot came over the speaker saying we need to turn back land and de-board again switch gates then it gets delayed for an hour after they told us there was an immediate plane waiting. By far the worst and stressful experience I have ever had. I will never fly with American again.,1american-airlines,29/05/14,"LHR-DFW-SNA and return-first leg B773 very comfortable and on time AA gave us an unexpected and unasked for complimentary upgrade to MCE (very much appreciated). FA's were excellent second leg B738 was delayed by 2 hrs by storms at DFW scattering aircraft and crews everywhere AA performed miracles getting crews together. Return was on new B738 no complaints whatsoever everything to schedule however DFW-LHR on B772 was delayed approx 70 mins due to passengers trying to stow ""hand luggage"" larger than our hold luggage but again flight crew must've put the pedal to the metal as only arrived 15 mins late. Did not as one of life's great sleepers use the IFE on any legs and do not have any great expectations on airline food so wasn't disappointed.",9american-airlines,28/05/14,We flew from Las Vegas to JFK New York on 23rd May this year with American Airlines and we have never encountered such rude and unhelpful flight attendants. It was a 4.5 hour flight and they only came round with the drinks trolley once at the beginning of the flight and when I asked for some water was told that she wasn't there to run round after me! I was horrified but told her that I would follow her down to the galley and get my own water so she stormed off and brought me one back. The whole flight she was abrupt and rude. There were 6 of us in the party on holiday in 3 separate cities in USA. That was the only one where we encountered rude and nasty staff.,1american-airlines,27/05/14,LHR-LAX. After reading about the new business class cabin on American's 777-300 we decided to book our trip with them. We made a great choice. At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good. Crew warmed up after a while and responded well to all requests. The walk-up bar had loads of snacks and was topped up throughout. Flight was on time. Remote stand a bit of pain but I understand this is due to construction. Definitely recommend.,9american-airlines,26/05/14,MXP-JFK return in economy. Boeing 767-300 was comfortable and silent service just okay seats cramped food too limited for a long range flight both inbound and outbound. Inflight entertainment just OK. Asked for upgrading purchase on return flight at check-in and was told from AA lady at counter the price was USD 7000 one way - unbelievable what a joke! Avoid AA from Milan fly Delta or Emirates.,3american-airlines,25/05/14,Boeing 777-300 GRU-JFK First Class. True waste of money or miles until crew's sense of premium service matches product. Last night First Class service in my flight was a joke : from the warm champagne to the traffic of crew members congregated in the service area socializing quite loudly in the middle of the night; to the dirty wine glass. Unpleasant main dish and Breakfast service so rushed that it felt as if it was coach. Do not seat in 2A as crew will bother you with the curtain hitting your seat every time they march between cabins (all night long). Great product but substandard service. Stay in business.,2american-airlines,25/05/14,The food was ghastly. Dallas Fort Worth to London breakfast was a measly white bread bun bare on the tray (no plate or even plastic) with butter and cheese with a small tub of yoghurt and a small orange juice. The dinner chicken tasted awful. The service from the cabin staff was abrupt and short. Some hand wipes at meal times would be great as the toilets left much to be desired. Also at meal times they would not remind passengers to put their chairbacks up like the attendants on the other airlines I mostly use. I think Qatar Airways is doing itself a disservice by aligning with American Airlines on code share flights. I particularly booked with Qatar Airways as their service is always impeccable.,1american-airlines,24/05/14,If there was a way to rate this company's service to a score less than 1 I would do that. I booked my flight all confirmed connecting through Chicago. In Chicago after a gate change and an hour delay they cancelled the flight to my destination. No options no direction just cancelled. Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with. Avoid this airline by all means even if you have to pay a little more to go with another airline.,1american-airlines,20/05/14,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way. Very rude and terrible customer service. Will never fly again; I am not even going to use my voucher because that would mean I would have to travel again with this airline.",1american-airlines,20/05/14,"Was delayed out of DFW to SAT last night because after a long (DFW) taxi to the runway for take off we were informed that there was an issue with one of the computers. We were all curios as to why we got so close to being in the air before this ""issue"" was noticed - it is pretty obvious it wasn't Pilot error they completey felt our pain as did the flight attendants and gate workers. Of course we were re-booking a whole (S80) plane so it was obvius that we would have to wait for a plane to dead head. Fortunately that didn't take too long and we were just 2 hours late getting into SAT. Cudos to Capt Smith and his first officer for getting us home safely and the flight attendants that had to be dead on their feet undoubtably they all had a very stressful evening.",5american-airlines,20/05/14,Hope to never fly American Airlines again. I Was flying from Wichita KS to Dallas to my final destination Las Vegas on 5/18/2014. Our 3:00 flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Things happen so that was not a big deal how the situation was handled is my issue. All passengers with a connecting flight from Dallas was asked to stand in line there were about 40 to 50 passengers in line. There 2 American Airlines Rep working the counters needless to say they were very rude and short. They acted as if they were the one with the problem. They acted as if they did not care if the passengers found a connecting flight or not. I stood in line from approx 1:30 pm to 4:15pm well over 2 hours. Each Rep spent an average of 20 to 30 minutes per customer. At 4:15 2 more Reps appeared from the back however they did not have a clue what they were doing. The first guy told me that all Dallas flights were full and there was nothing available until the next morning and when I arrived in Dallas they would arrange for a hotel for the night. The person in line behind me; also going to Vegas was assisted by a different Rep who manage to find a flight for her and her 3 children. So I went back to the counter and spoke to a different Rep who was then able to find me a flight home that night. Needless to say this whole situation was very stressful and left a very bad reflection on American Airlines.,1american-airlines,19/05/14,"First and last time I will fly AA. Was ""bumped"" off original flight without being asked just told ""sorry you are now on next flight"". Next flight was supposed to be in 35 mins. I told flight attendant that if the flight was late I would miss my connecting flight she said ""sorry I don't make the rules"". Gentleman beside me said he would gladly wait for next flight as he didn't have a connection to make. She said ""no sorry"". Of course the flight was delayed and I missed my connection in Chicago. Once in Chicago I was told the next available flight was the next morning and no hotel or food voucher would be provided as it was an ""ATC"" issue not a AA issue on why there was a delay. What is ATC I asked - Air Traffic Control. AA had lots of people ""sleeping"" in O'Hare airport and it really was sad when you see seniors in wheelchairs having to sleep in their wheelchair because the cot they received was too low to the floor for them to lay down. Then the kicker is at 4am security is yelling wake up time to move along sleep time is over get moving. As I said first and last time I and many others will be travelling on AA.",1american-airlines,18/05/14,When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful. I had taken 4 advil at this point and still had back pain. Never again American Airlines never again.,1american-airlines,16/05/14,"Connecting flight from Dallas to Knoxville cancelled for ""maintenance"". Customer Service agents were clueless and basically no help and really not concerned that the flight was cancelled. Stayed in airport for 5 hours attempting to get on another flight via standby with no luck. Once it was determined I was stuck in Dallas they provided vouchers for a place to stay (can't call it a hotel) and $19 worth of food with the next flight out the next day. After waiting for the shuttle for an hour we finally were on our way for a good nights rest or so we thought. Once we arrived it was obvious this was a pay by the hour motel called ""The Night Hotel"". Wow This place was basically a brothel built around a night club. The next morning we were waiting on our 5 AM cab ride to the airport and 4 prostitutes came walking through the door. Bottom line I can't believe American Airlines had the audacity to do what they did.",1american-airlines,16/05/14,"Cancun-Dallas Had a connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto which was delayed for several hours then ultimately cancelled due to ""a missing captain"". We had to re-book with an extremely rude and unsympathetic Customer Service Agent who told us that the next available flight was 10 am the next morning. We were traveling for a total of 36 hours. We were offered no compensation for the cancellation no apologies no Hotel or Meal vouchers. We had to sleep at the airport on a chair. Needless to say we will no longer ever use American Airlines to fly.",1american-airlines,15/05/14,LHR-MIA-LIM-MIA in economy. I expected a poor experience and with the exception of the first leg in the 777-300 they lived up to expectations. Old aircraft with technical issues on both MIA-LIM and LIM-MIA leading to delays in both directions inedible food unfriendly and unsmiling flight attendants dirty interiors cramped seating and no attempt to be of any help. Ate nothing as my vegetarian food requests had been overlooked/ignored (despite it being on my ticket) no apology or attempt to offer an alternative. Overall a very poor partner to BA. The score of 3 is awarded because of the LHR-MIA part of the journey only.,3american-airlines,15/05/14,American Airlines needs to work on their sensitivity to breast feeding mom's. They insisted I check my carry on suitcase b/c I was carrying a breast pump. Even when I consolidated my bags to 2 items they would not let me board without checking my bags. Nice!! Oh to be a professional man and not have to worry about airlines trying to put obstacles in the way of feeding your baby even when you travel for work.,1american-airlines,15/05/14,Toledo OH to Denver CO via one stop in Chicago (O'Hare) Trip to Denver had one delay of 3 hours at Chicago. May 7 2014 no reason given. Coming back snow storm in Denver delayed the plane takeoff by 1 hour not so bad. However when I got to Chicago the nightmare began. First flight to Toledo was delayed then cancelled. Reason who knows no 2nd pilot was the reason given. Got another flight time. Rain storm came. Two more flights delayed moved to different gate delayed then cancelled. What to do? No hotels taxi line 2 miles long. I left the boarding area so couldn't get back upstairs. Had to spend the night in a hard chair. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Wayne Indiana so I could get home. No flights to Toledo. What a nightmare experience!,1american-airlines,15/05/14,Chicago ORD to Boston. They got me to where I wanted to go at a reasonable time at a reasonable price. Can't blame American for the delay. I didn't expect free food or free alcohol. B737-800 was fine and so was the crew.,5american-airlines,13/05/14,Worst customer service I have had. My flight was cancelled today due to reasons that the airline had no control over but the customer service was awful. I was at O'Hare in Chicago flying to Phoenix and departing at 11.35. I left the airport today in Chicago feeling like I got stranded with no help and to fend for myself. I have never had a cancelled flight and didn't know what to do. I followed everyone else and waited to speak to an agent in line for almost 2 hours. When it was my turn to speak to someone they closed the line down and said we needed to go to the booking desk. I had no idea where that was and tried to ask. After being ignored one of the agents snapped at me and told me they couldn't help me unless I was flying to Dallas. They wouldn't even direct me on where I needed to go. I will never fly this airline again after I finally get home tomorrow. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.,1american-airlines,13/05/14,"Flew May 13/14 2014 ONT-DAL-DTW. This was the worst flight experience I've had. The plane in ONT was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance causing nearly everyone to miss their connecting flight out of DAL. We had to wait in line (I waited 1.5 hours) at ONT to get on a new connecting flight out of DAL. The seats on the plane out of ONT were tiny old creaky and uncomfortable and staff were disinterested and unfriendly. There was no ""inflight entertainment"" to speak of. The worst came however when we arrived at DAL. Immediately upon disembarking we were informed that ""there are no hotel rooms left in Dallas"". The customer service reps feebly tried to console people with Nature Valley granola bars and cheaply-made cots but everyone was in a mostly miserable mood. I and many others ended up trying to sleep on chairs through the night. Very few people got any sleep. Terrible experience all around. The last time I fly American.",1american-airlines,13/05/14,I flew from JFK to LHR with my family on 9th May. I was very pleased with the flight experience. I value a good entertainment system more which this Boeing 777 had with personal power outlet than the quality of food. There are restaurants at JFK that offer various choices. The irplane is not a restaurant. Food is a + but my values are on the seat comfort more. Seats were comfortable. Service was very efficient and fast. I also liked the dimmed cabin. Only bad thing was that the AC fan was on a quite heavy mode. Crew were mostly very friendly.,10american-airlines,11/05/14,Traveling from Miami to Santo Domingo arrived at the airport approximately 1.5 prior to departure. First you have to queue to help yourself at one of the self-service check in machine. After waiting for approximately 10 minutes we go through the check in procedure experienced some problem and had to get help from the staff member at the check in station. In the end we were unable to check in and were asked to go to the customer service counter. The staff member at the counter asks us to wait and disappears for 5 to 10 min and when he returns he advises us that we are now to late to check in luggage as it is less than an hour before departure and we are talking about 10 minutes now. He advises us that we can fly but our luggage cannot. Only option is to take a flight the next day pay $120 to change the flight and pay for another night in a hotel. The main issue here is the rude attitude of the staff. We can accept that there are rules to be followed but the attitude of the staff is a disgrace. AA have never been a great airline but this experience is by far the worst we have ever experience with any airline. We will do our very best to avoid flying AA again.,1american-airlines,11/05/14,"LHR-DFW-XNA AA51 transatlantic then American Eagle. I had avoided American Airlines transatlantic for years but thought to give the ""new"" American a try. Boeing 777-300ER already showing wear and tear in First Class. Cabin was dirty and food was inedible. Also the logic of serving lunch/dinner on an 09.30 flight utterly defeats me. Why not serve lovely breakfast? Crew was keen to get meal service over and disappear for the remainder of the flight. Flight diverted to IAH due to low fuel / weather but almost no announcements from flight deck. On American Eagle flight attendant was rude and not professionally dressed; She wore a crumpled uniform and believe it or not Dutch-style clogs. Overall it is so sad that there is no sophistication nor manner / culture at the ""new"" American Airlines. Travel on American Airlines is nowhere close to a First Class experience. This is a desperately poor airline but there isn't much choice across the pond sadly. Avoid this carrier if you can.",1american-airlines,11/05/14,We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night. Of course that meant that even without entertainment there was also no sleeping for those of us unlucky enough to be in this attendant's vicinity.,1american-airlines,10/05/14,LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.,3american-airlines,08/05/14,"April 24th from MSP-DFW-SAN. No major complaints in-flight arrived close to on time. I was concerned when I was unable to check in online so I emailed customer service and they apologized for the issues they were having with the American/US Airways merger. It was all good as I was able to check us in and print our boarding passes at the airport kiosk (even though the message when I tried to check in online said ""see agent at airport""). All in all a fine experience. My next flight will be on Spirit Airlines so wish me luck.",8american-airlines,08/05/14,Worst airline I have flown with. American Airlines should be branded a budget airline. Flew from JFK to LHR and the experience was beyond belief. Firstly I was charged an arm and leg for excess weight off my bag. Secondly the staff on AA should get training serious training and customer service skills. The food is almost non existent seats are worst in class and the TV's are approx 4inch which are well scratched and used!,1american-airlines,08/05/14,I just returned from a trip from Seattle WA to Punta Cana DR and back. I told my husband after the first plane that I would never fly American again. It was 3 planes there and 3 back. The seats were the most tiny and uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I am 5 ft 2 and 115 lbs so by no means am I a big person. The staff were awful. I have never met people so disinterested and rude. When leaving Punta Cana we sat in line for 1.5 hours because there was no one there to check us in! Every other airline were getting people through. We made it to our flight in the nick of time. We got there at 4am and didn't get to the plane until 6.25 and it left at 6.50. They were almost done boarding. I do not recommend this airline.,1american-airlines,08/05/14,From Sacramento to Dallas 4 of us booked our trip in early January. Final destination Paris France. We tried to select seats but arrived to find our seats changed. None of us together and 1 was the very back where it was so very noisy the flight was miserable. In Dallas we switched planes (again operated by American Airlines) what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover became an 8 hour layover. The legroom was non existent and when the people in front of us tilted chairs back we could hardly move for 10 hours. miserable. I will not support American Airlines to Europe or even to Dallas. I am not sure if they have just gone downhill or what. I must commend the fellow passengers for their tolerance of such a crummy flight.,2american-airlines,06/05/14,DFW to MOB flight AA2981 and AA3377 MOB to DFW. On our round trip flight so far 2 of the 3 aircraft's have had maintenance issues resulting in delays missed connections and waiting on standby. We have yet to hear a single apology.,2american-airlines,06/05/14,CDG-ORD-BWI operated on a Boeing 767-300 and an Embraer 145. I have Gold status on AA so I was able to obtain a Main Cabin Extra seat on the first flight free of charge and an exit-row seat on the second flight. The ground experience at CDG was okay and they were pretty well organized. The first flight took off on-time although we had to board by bus (something that probably irritates every passenger). Cabin crew were okay and there was no IFE which I knew to expect even though practically every other carrier has it by now. The connection at ORD was amazingly painless and security was a breeze. The Eagle flight was delayed due to a late inbound aircraft but we landed a mere 30 minutes behind schedule and my checked bag was waiting for me on the carousel just 10 minutes or so after landing. All in all fairly satisfied.,7american-airlines,05/05/14,Tampa to Chicago O'Hare on 28 April. Check-in was fast but very unfriendly. Cabin crew were unfriendly and uninterested. Plane was cramped and service was almost non-existent. Only thing offered was soft-drinks. No hot drinks snacks or food available which is pretty poor for a what's scheduled as a 3 hour flight. No entertainment on offer the flight got me from A to B but that's about it. I've had better service on Ryanair. Not a great addition to the Oneworld Alliance.,4american-airlines,04/05/14,"I am currently sitting at LAX airport and having the worst experience I had with an airline. I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well. Everything was dealt in a rush/unplanned manner showing AA have no control to handle such situations. Now I am here hoping to not get bumped again or get stuck in LA for the night after 16 hrs flying from Australia then meet my wife at my destination and go to the hotel to have a rest. This was my first flight with AA and certainly the last one.",1american-airlines,03/05/14,MEX-DFW-YUL Business Class. We were lucky enough to get a discounted fare so that Business Class was a bit cheaper than the economy class fares available. On the MEX-DFW leg plane was an old and a bit worn out MD80. Good flight with a really kind and helpful flight assistant who spoke a perfect Spanish. I don't fly AA often but I must admit that I've always found nice and smiling staff both in business and economy class. Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff. On the bright side wifi was good and the view on the tarmac was excellent. The DFW-YUL leg was on a newer 737 and it was an uneventful flight with a good lunch but a very poor selection of drinks. Nice staff.,7american-airlines,28/04/14,I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.,2american-airlines,28/04/14,"Flew MIA-BCN business class. I am a long user of AA but always inside the US or from Venezuela to US. This is the first time I took AA to Europe usually when going to Spain I use Iberia. I had very low expectations but must say I was impressed. This flight was on the o767 the cabin in business is the ""old business class"" with seats that do not lie flat but I must say that it was comfortable enough to take a 4 hour sleep. Amenities kit nice and pretty. No private screen but a Samsung tablet was provided not a huge a mount of options but it was more than Ok. The biggest surprise? Food was excellent and in amounts that I have never seen before in other Business class. Plenty of bubbly. Service extraordinary FA's smiling and helpful.",7american-airlines,28/04/14,AA flight 1612 from Phoenix to Dallas/Fort Worth was great. Plane was only 1 year old flight servers were fantastic and funny excellent beverage service and communication from captain to passengers polite timely and sincere. Really liked the comfort of the plane extra leg room soft comfortable seats and inscreen TV monitor.,10american-airlines,27/04/14,Flew DFW to FRA on 777. Crew was very helpful. Nice entertainment. Good food! This is one of the best airlines in the US.,10american-airlines,24/04/14,LGA-PBI April 19th 2014 was overall great. Flight was on time and we even landed early. The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A8B8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8. All in all great flight and I love American they will always be my #1 airline to fly and I would still recommend flying them just not in row 8 MCE.,7american-airlines,22/04/14,My recent trip with American Airlines has made me become a United loyalist. I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping. Never flying American again.,1american-airlines,22/04/14,Dallas to London in Business. The new AA cabin looks very good - spacious flat bed seats lots of storage and a big screen. However it was let down by slow service food that was simply not up to standard and the IFE froze and was not reset. AA has got the basics right but needs to work on the details.,5american-airlines,22/04/14,Several flights over the last month LA to Santa Fe Sioux a City Chicago Denver Las Vegas Lax Honolulu. All flights on time had preferred seating on all flights where available and could notice difference. Crew reasonably friendly although best crew LAX-HNL. Negative definitely good for purchase LAX-HNL Cheese and fruit not worth the money Turkey and & Chutney sandwich bread very dry and stale. Again not worth the money. American take a lesson from many International airlines and what they offer Economy passengers in a 5 hour sector. Would still recommend as a US Domestic carrier.,8american-airlines,22/04/14,If you have to fly with someone don't fly with AA. They made me check in my carry on luggage and were unable to open the undercarriage door making me miss my connector flight to Atlanta. I had to stay overnight in Chicago due to their failure. I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage. Worst airline I've ever used so far.,1american-airlines,22/04/14,Mediocre service. Just flew from John Wayne to DFW and the flight was freezing. I asked for a blanket and was told they don't have any only to see unopened blankets on every seat in first class. I guess only first class passengers are worthy of being comfort. That really irritated me after freezing for two hours to see that they could have very easily provided a blanket. Really poor customer service. To actually say they don't have blankets when they do and you then see them.,5american-airlines,21/04/14,"GRU-DFW in new 773. What a great and enjoyable flight. New plane comfortable seats excellent food huge movie selection and a wonderful crew. If this is the ""new"" American they have got it right!",10american-airlines,21/04/14,NYC/JFK to BUE/EZE. Flights AA953/09Apr and AA954/14Apr. Both flights departed on time and both arrived early operated with B777-200 equipment. Check in procedures at both airports efficient and quick with smiles. Seat width adequate seat pitch could use an additional inch but seat cushion comfort rock hard and unacceptable! I saw nothing international about their heralded international flagship service. The dinners served in both directions were big on flavor/taste but small in serving size. The salad ex/NYC had seen better days but the salad ex/BUE was crisp excellent and fresh. Dessert ex/NYC was a tasty pre-packaged chocolate brownie but only a 'Bon o Bon' ex/BUE. What was referred to as breakfast on both flights was a warm croissant with butter and jam served with OJ and a fruit yoghurt ex/NYC and OJ a very fresh fruit salad ex/BUE. The catering ex/BUE was of a much higher calibre/quality than that out of NYC/JFK. On both flights the inflight cabin crews were efficiently friendly and served with smiles. Where AA really excelled was how they treated me as a WCHC wheelchair passenger. Everyone I came in contact with in both cities and inflight both AA staff and their handling agents treated me with care dignity and respect! Would have NO problem recommending AA to others for their air travel.,8american-airlines,21/04/14,Nothing wrong with the service or the food but on some routes such as Barcelona to New York the planes are old and do not have individual entertainment systems. This means you have to watch whatever film is being shown on the overhead monitors making for a very long trip. There is a huge amount of competition out there so unless AA/US Air get new planes I will not be flying with them again.,2american-airlines,21/04/14,Day trip from LGA to ORD First class. Never flown with AA before but was impressed. Lounges not as good as BA's but cabin crew delivered excellent service both ways. Outbound lunch was tasty chicken salad and cookies and dinner on the return was a tasty pasta dish with a dessert. Brandy and chocolates rounded it off very well.,9american-airlines,21/04/14,JFK-MIA-BOG round trip early-April 2014 in economy. American Airlines staff are consistently rude and grumpy. I am constantly surprised when once in a while there is a ground staff or cabin crew member who are actually polite and helpful.,2american-airlines,17/04/14,"American Airlines gave away our 3 first class seats on Flight 53 from MIA to DFW on Sunday April 13 despite the fact that we were at the gate 17 minutes before flight time. The agent had already left the with the standby passengers. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to AMA and to have to overnight at DFW. Also one of our party had to fly coach even though we purchased a first class seat. I used to worry that with the merger AA 's customer service would sink to U.S. Airs level. Now I'm afraid the ""new American Airlines"" will sink to an even lower level. They sent our luggage on to our final destination. I have lifetime Platinum status on AA for having flown over 2.2 million miles with them.",1american-airlines,16/04/14,Flew LHR to Miami on a 777 in the new business class. Seating very comfortable. It was a daytime flight so I can't comment on the seat for an overnight flight. Great service. Food very acceptable. IFE excellent. Lounge at LHR is adequate nothing more. Immigration officer at MIA was the rudest man I've come across in a long time but that's not AA's fault. Their pre-landing video suggests that the immigration staff are there to help - not!,10american-airlines,15/04/14,I just took a trip 2 weeks ago. Flew from Chicago to Dallas Dallas to El Salvador. We landed in Dallas with 27 minutes until our next flight was leaving so we ran through the airport made my flight and thought there is was no way our luggage made it! We were so excited when we arrived in El Salvador to find that all of our bags made it.,8american-airlines,15/04/14,"13 April 2014. AA1119 from Boston to Chicago ORD. AA1159 from Chicago to St Louis. There was a major delay due to the weather. So I checked with the crew at gate B30 before I board in Boston. She said AA1159 would also be delayed so it's ok. While I was checking my flight connection the other crew used the microphone and told everyone ""If you are woried about your connection don't be."" When we landed in Chicago I checked the gate for AA1159 via my phone status ""In Flight"". The gate was H11B so I went to the crew at H11A see what can they do for me. Since there were no more flights to St Louis they can only schedule me for the first flight the next morning. I asked where I could stay for the night told me I could stay at the gate or she could offer me a hotel for reduce rate. I decided to stay at the gate.",1american-airlines,15/04/14,Flight from LA to JAX via Miami was uneventful. Flight from JAX to Dallas was a total different story! Our flight left Florida at 7.20 am. After an hour in the air the captain announced we had to land urgently in Birmingham Alabama. Around 10 am they told us the mechanic was on the way and would take one more hour! By noon they announced there would be a plane coming from Dallas and should be in Birmingham by noon. We would be on our way and arrive at Dallas by 2.30 pm. I called an agent and was told there was only flight available leaving Dallas at 8.30 pm and arriving at LAX at 10.40 pm. We continued to wait and wondered what happened to the plane. The plane arrived in Birmingham at 3.00 pm. We were boarded by 3.20 pm. We were not moving for another two hours. Finally arrived to Dallas after 7 pm. Most of us had missed connecting flights and were told there would be an agent waiting for us at the gate to rebook our flights. There was no one waiting at the gate. I finally got on the next flight out of Dallas and felt lucky to be able to get on the 8.10 flight to arrive in LA at 9.40 pm. Arrived at LAX at 9.30 pm and told there was no gate available for another 20-30 min. We waited on the plane for 1 hr 40 min. I probably will not fly AA again.,1american-airlines,15/04/14,4/13/14. Flew from Rochester NY to Chicago. Plane was 45 minutes late due to weather taxiing from far reaches of O'Hare then no crew at taxiway. Missed our connection to Seattle. All flights overbooked so could not get on via standby had to stay overnight and pay for a hotel. Told our first class tickets through Travelocity were really Economy with instant upgrade we ultimately went coach 20 or so hours late. Never again. They did give us two $300 vouchers good for future travel within a year.,1american-airlines,14/04/14,We flew Heathrow to Puerto Rico 2 adults and 3 children under 12. When we tried to check-in online there were only 5 paid seats together - the others were scattered around the plane. Clearly we couldn't sit the 3 children on their own so we contacted AA and were told we'd have to pay the extra (Â£220) and book the paid seats which we did very reluctantly. When we checked in at the desk however we were told we couldn't have the seats we'd booked and were given 5 others which were a 2 and a 3. During the second leg of the trip we were given exit seats which were not allowed for children as we were told they would be 'a good bargaining tool' for swaps. On the return we couldn't sit at all near each other: 3 of us sat on the very back row and 2 at the front of the plane. However AA used BA as a carrier for the final leg - they had automatically allocated five seats together because we were travelling with children and allowed us onto the plane first - a completely different attitude from AA. I agree with former reviews - the seatbelt signs hardly went off on the AA flights which is unacceptable on long-haul. I have claimed a refund for the booked seats which we didn't get - am waiting to see if I'll actually get the money back.,3american-airlines,08/04/14,When we used to be able to fly through Chicago O'hare AA wasn't as bad. The last 12 times we've gone through DFW the plane sits on the runway after arrival for 30 minutes every time. This makes even an average time between connections tight. Then we get to our gate and the gate has changed while we're on the skytrain. And too often the flight is cancelled for no known reason. AA changes my seat unbeknown to me until check in which irks me. I do not care for the new 737s. All seats are 3+3 so there are no good rows and already tray tables are broken lights don't work and I don't think they fix them often. My husband is a 'top' platinum so he doesn't have some of the problems I do but he's not pleased anymore either.,1american-airlines,07/04/14,"Have lived outside the US for 20+ years. Have flown many long haul flights to European hubs and then on to different cities in the US. We usually fly on British Airways (great airline) or KLM or Delta. For the first time was forced (because of a change in flight schedules) to fly on American Airlines from DFW to London (Heathrow) yesterday. So many things wrong: seatbelt sign on for most of the flight despite only occasional mild turbulence. Not acceptable on a 9 hour flight. The flight attendants were not friendly or service oriented. They mostly communicated with each other and acted annoyed when interacting with passengers. or they just sat in the galley. On this long flight a request for another small bottle of water (in business class) was denied: ""Only one per customer"". They did not come around even once during the night to offer drinks. Unless there is no other choice avoid long-haul trips on this airline. The ground staff were a little better still not customer oriented.",6american-airlines,07/04/14,My husband and I have been trying to get home since 4/6/2014 we were booked on a flight at 4.10 after a one hour delay they cancelled it. We couldn't get booked on another flight so we had to stay over. They booked us on flight #2575 at 9.25 then overnight somehow we got cancelled even though we had recheck boarding passes. We were re- booked for a noon flight #2419. Then after being directed to 2 different gates and waiting in the airport for over 12 hours today 4/7/2014 our flights to Albuquerque were canceled. We were sent to 5 different gates during the 12 hours. 3 cancellations in 24 hours it's unacceptable customer service. We still don't know if we're actually going to have a plane at 8.20 flight #1285.,1american-airlines,06/04/14,My husband and I were on flight 2224 from Las Vegas on April 4. The airplane was an S-80. We flew first class and were very disappointed. The only difference between first and the rest of the plane was a wider seat and meal. The plane didn't have movies or music. Bare bones plane for sure. Also a constant stream of people walking from the back of the plane to use front lavatory. Also alcohol is plentiful if you drink however I wanted ice tea and that is not an option. Maybe they don't know that it is available in bottles or cans.,1american-airlines,06/04/14,Flew LHR-MIA. Seats are uncomfortable Inflight entertainment is below par. Overall its better just to avoid AA by all means.,4american-airlines,06/04/14,AA997 DFW-EZE on 4 April - First Class. Overall a great experience. The purser was very personable and professional. 777-200 plane which has seen better days - for a first class seat (that I will say was super comfortable to sleep in as it was totally flat and they give you a thin mattress which makes it much better) there were so many little tears and things that made the seat look tatty. Food was good - appetizer soup (great pumpkin soup) salad chicken and veggies and desert. In-flight TV on AA is always a joke compared to any other carrier - too few TV shows - too few updated recent movies - super small screen for a first class experience. But for the price and the overall service - AA wins on this flight. I have recently had a lot of flights and AA has been doing great. Keep up the great work!,9american-airlines,04/04/14,We flew in from Jamaica to Dallas Fort Worth Texas and our flight was delayed. The biggest problem was that there was little information given to passengers. After 2 hours we found out we were waiting for a crew to arrive from another destination. After being delayed 4 hours we finally got on the plane to sit on the runway for another 45 minutes. The pilot said we were being re-routed due to weather and did not have enough fuel and would have to go back to the gate to refuel. We reach the gate at 2am and wait to only be told the flight was now cancelled. This is where I truly get frustrated with the way things were handled. 150+ passengers are told their flight is cancelled but there is no other flights going into Louisville. You will have to find another way home or wait until Wednesday (6 days later)! We wait in line another 1.5 hrs to try and find a flight close to home willing to drive the rest of the way. The gate agents have been no help whatsoever it was 5.30 in the morning and they offered no cots or anything to us. There were no hotel rooms. They did give us a $12 voucher for a meal. Finally got a late flight almost 24 hours later to Cincinnati but now have to incur additional expense of renting a car to get home. Tried to get on a couple of standby flights but I have noticed that AA overbooked every flight and boots people off so stand by is a joke. Highly disappointed!,1american-airlines,03/04/14,Paid $1700 for two seats. Airline website would not allow us to choose seats at time of booking. Return a week later to book and lo and behold only paid seats left. Call Airline and told unless we pay and additional $170 per person we will have to depend on the kindness of others to move seats so we can sit together. This is absolute crap. If you can't book your seats at time of booking then don't buy the ticket unless you're willing to pay additional $$$ to actually get a seat.,1american-airlines,03/04/14,We flew from MCO via MIA to Punta Cana. The first leg was fine and for an hours flight every was completely satisfying. The second leg from Miami to Punta Cana was a total disappointment for my first international flight with AA. At the airport I was rejected to enter the lounge as for flights to The Caribbean the access is excluded. This logic I will never understand. The two flight attendants have been absolutely passive in their service and spent their time rather with making jokes with each other or actively ignoring requests such as a glass of water or getting visa documents. One flight attendant had his hands in his pockets at all times - while going through the aisle. I have never been so disappointed from a Business Class flight before. For sure AA will not have me as a customer onboard again and I am glad that there are a lot of options on the US flight market.,2american-airlines,02/04/14,AA 324 MCO-DFW in First. Flight on time pre-ordered snack delivered cheerfully pre-departure drinks offered. Inflight the Attendant could not do enough for everyone. Ordered 5 star connecting service and arrival service. Was met at the arriving gate at DFW and taken by golf cart to the Admirals Club in Concourse D. I was able to bypass the Admirals club check in line handed Premium Drink vouchers and told I would be greeted by someone else to take me to my next flight. Shortly afterward the weather turned horrible for about an hour. My new 5 star agent found me in the Admirals Club and asked if I had any questions. I had her check to make sure the plane taking me to Santiago Chile made it on the ground. She came back to confirm it was on the ground but waiting for a gate due to the weather. Near boarding time she collected me and carted me off to the gate. I was carted back to the Admirals Club and asked to be kept informed of the situation. I was collected again and informed the new plane was ready but they were under tight time constraints to get it going due to crew time restraints. AA's Flagship suite is comfortable the turn down service pyjamas slippers and kit were all very nice. The international crew in First save for one employee were polite but simply went through the motions. The food was decent. Filled out the Breakfast Card and awoke to a nice breakfast and a wonderful view of the Andes as the sun was rising. Despite the Delay in DFW good job by AA.,9american-airlines,02/04/14,"I arrived 4 hours early for my late afternoon flight to Orlando after my cruise. I was confirmed in Main Cabin Extra. Miami has always been a ""challenging"" airport but not having been there in over a decade it was a whole new challenge. My bag was 5 lbs overweight so I had to go buy a small personal carry item and remove 5 lbs from my bag. Needless to say a huge hassle. Since I checked in so early American did not offer to put me on one of the several flight before mine but they certainly did send my bag early as it was already in this huge mire when I arrived in Orlando. The security situation in Miami is a nightmare. Once finally through the drama the new terminal AA built was nice with allot more choices of things to do but it seemed gate after gate I passed no one cleaned up the trash left by the customers. Flight boarded on time I asked for some tissue got it promptly then only saw the Flight attendants during seat belt check before and take off and landing. They all seemed to pile into F class and offer multiple drink rounds. Main Cabin Extra is what AA Coach used to be minus the service. We arrived on time and my bag had been waiting hours for me. No complaints.",7american-airlines,02/04/14,I hadn't flown American since the mid-80s when the service varied between passive-aggressive and actively unpleasant. Things have improved since then. The service on two flights - business from Miami to San Jose and economy from Panama City to Miami - was fine and even friendly. But the entertainment food etc show less sign of change.,4american-airlines,31/03/14,6 flights with AA in the past month or two. JFK-MIA: Arrived at check-in counter on time. Staff were friendly enough and seemed to be at ease but maintained proper professionalism. Flight waited 20 minutes at the gate before taxiing because of some missing passengers. Nice well maintained 757 seats were comfortable although not the best and flight attendants were nice. Rather bad entertainment. 2 hour flight landed in Miami with no issues. MIA-MGA (Nicaragua): Had roughly a 2 hour layover until connecting flight was scheduled. Everything went smoothly no complaints there. Flight into Managua was a little worse - 757 was a bit dilapidated and we had about an hour delay before taking off. Staff at the gate upon landing pointed us towards our destination and were very welcoming. MGA-MIA-JFK: Return flight went well nothing really remarkable. Everything was on time staff were nice and helpful seats were alright. JFK-LHR: On one of the older 777-200ER aircraft. Staff very friendly and professional. One of the flight attendants even went as far as to sit down and conduct conversation with a few of the passengers during the flight and gave off a very good vibe. Throughout the 6 hour flight the flight the attendants came around frequently and often were available to provide passengers with snacks and drinks whenever prompted. Seats were surprisingly comfortable and the flight wasn't even half full so almost everyone in Economy had the chance to fully recline across the 5 seat middle aisle (One of the advantages of the 200ER over the 300ER). Meals were actually pretty decent and I had few complaints. Fairly good entertainment with a selection of about 30 films and 10 TV shows. Flight landed smoothly and we were quickly on our way through customs and security. LHR-JFK: The flight was a little more crowded but there was still room to switch seats and there were a few open middle aisles to lie down on. Lunch was a small pizza which wasn't too bad. Flight landed smoothly and there were staff at the door to greet us. Would fly again.,8american-airlines,31/03/14,I was traveling home from Palm Springs CA. through Dallas. Flight was delayed 3 times through e-mail notification before any gate agent was seen. When I asked the young lady about our flight she didn't know anything. After a couple of calls she made an announcement. All I wanted was some info so I knew what to do next. After boarding and taxiing to the runway we were told we did not have enough fuel to make it around the approaching storm. Then the flight was canceled and re-instated in about 15 minutes. After we did land 6 hours late in Shreveport I called customer relations and they were not helpful at all. I was offered $200 toward my next travel.,1american-airlines,30/03/14,23 March. JAX to DFW to connect with a BA flight back to LHR (comment later). Aircraft MD83. I took this flight with very low expectations following past experience and general comments. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. Check-in at JAX was swift friendly and cruised past security in no time; was offered Fast Track and then again JAX is not the busiest of airports in the US. Unfortunately there are no lounges for premium passengers unless you are flying DL or their Skyteam partners. Boarding was relatively ordered. Was greeted with a smile (first impression counts) and shown to my seat by the friendly stewardess. Unlike many European carriers on their shorthaul aircraft's the premium cabins in this case do have distinct seating in their different classes. For the type of aircraft and duration of flight I would say it was quite appropriate - no use expecting a flatbed or deluxe booth for a two hour + flight. Once boarding was complete announcements were made hot towels offered followed by a choice of bubbly juice or water. Lift off was on time and flight pretty smooth most of the time. A few bumps here and there but that's part of flying. Service was above my expectations the stewardess was extremely friendly helpful and fully justified the premium escence of the cabin. Main and only disappointment was the food. Not bad but certainly not a First Class offering. On shorter Asian and European journeys the offering is far superior in a comparable cabin. On the other hand being a nut-allergy sufferer the pre-lunch aperitif of warm nuts was a no-go for me however this charming lady went out of her way to get me an appropriate (and definitely yummier) substitute - corn chips with a houmous dip. Landing was a bit later than scheduled but beforehand I was explained the best way of getting to my connecting flight. Surprisingly and with a mere 40 minutes to spare my bag even made it to my connection. Well done American!,6american-airlines,30/03/14,Only drinks were offered on flight. Not even a bag of peanuts. The man beside us tried to buy food but said they were basically out and we were only a few rows behind business class. Flying from Toronto and connecting in Miami. Lost our luggage on our connection to Costa Rica. Had to wait 2 hours in Costa Rica airport for lost luggage and said would have it later that night delivered to hotel. Wasn't there the next day and had no idea where it was. No one would pick up the phone at the airport. Finally got it the following morning when we were at another hotel 4 hours away. First and last time.,1american-airlines,30/03/14,Everything was fine except they did not offer any food in Economy class (you have to pay for some poor snacks). Our flight was at lunchtime. The ticket fare was $500 you'd think they would manage to fit a sandwich or slice of pizza in the budget. The Business Class passengers were served snacks hot meals and free alcoholic drinks. Outrageous.,1american-airlines,30/03/14,Flight from RTB to FRA via MIA. Flight departed in Roatan 1hr delayed. After the immigration we missed our connection flight. So we had to rebook for the next day. Finding the airport shuttle to the hotel was very hard without any guidance. Rebooked flight to FRA via DFW was delayed for another hour so we thought it could get close again. So we asked for the gate for our connection flight. After reaching the gate we were told that this is the wrong gate and the flight is delayed or another three hours. All ground staff were rude and not willing to get us asap to FRA. The Entertainment system is not state of the art and sometimes not working. The crew were unfriendly. Food is a joke. Never again with AA.,2american-airlines,29/03/14,ORD-MIA on March 27. 737-800. Flight was packed and had Emergency Row window - my favorite seat 14F. Upon boarding F/A at door was all smiles - even joked with me while waiting for First Class passengers to get settled while I was at the door. Really fun group of FAs and all smiling. Flight was just about 3 hours and went by fast. Had cheese and crackers snack so not much but we all know the inflight catering in Economy is basically nothing so no complaints. Just bring your own food if you want something substantial. Nothing was shown on the TV's so not sure why - that's the only thing to really say was a let-down. Landed early and bag out quickly. Good job AA!,8american-airlines,29/03/14,"MIA-POS 28 March in Business Class. 757 had new seats and was 50% full so plenty of room. Departure was 1 hour late due to First Officer being 1 hour late to the flight (wasn't explained why but they kept us in the boarding area so we didn't have to sit on the hot plane). Flight attendants in Biz Class were great - super friendly and smiles. Purser came and greeted each passenger - and his partner FA was all smiles and anticipated your needs which was amazing. Food was really good - AA has changed its menu and very tasty and healthy. Flight was only 3 hours so went by quickly. Another ""Thanks for flying with AA"" from the Purser prior to landing. Keep up the good work American - really was excellent service.",9american-airlines,27/03/14,My husband and I travelled from San Juan to Miami and to Seattle. Nothing was offered in the form of snacks so forget about food. Such a long ride and the seats were very uncomfortable. We had to pay $25.00 for the checked bag. I don't understand how the airlines are getting so cheap. I looked online before I left and it said there would not be any charge for the checked bag. From Seattle to Atlanta and then to San Juan I travelled on the Delta Airlines and we were given snacks.,3american-airlines,26/03/14,MAN to JFK on British Airways ticket but American Airlines aircraft. Very old B757 aircraft that has not been refurbished. No seat back screens. Only two choices of meal (three on virgin Atlantic). Very average quality and small portion size. Dessert consisted of a couple of biscuits. Crew were pretty good. No complaints and flight was on time. Seating was cramped. Large number of seats converted to extra legroom but for a premium price.,5american-airlines,26/03/14,Flight #1361 BNA-LAX on 3/14/2014. 1st class AM flight and was offered Corn Flakes or Oatmeal? Isn't this 1st class. In this day and age I cannot believe this is the offering. Where is the fruit yoghurt or hot breakfast sandwich? Coach was offered nothing. Nothing to purchase not even a miniature snack of nuts. This was a 5 hour flight. I expect that length of flight to at the very minimum offer a meal that is available to purchase.,3american-airlines,25/03/14,Flew on an award economy ticket RDU-LHR-RDU a very convenient route if you live in NC/SC or Southern VA. Both flights on time the food edible the service efficient if not enthusiastic the seats cramped and uncomfortable. AA deploys a 767-300 on this route a fine 20th century workhorse but woefully inadequate for the 21st century in passenger comfort and technology - only cabin ceiling monitors for in flight entertainment. The new AA/US combination will need to work hard in the future to match their partner BA and the others competing with them offering US to Europe non stops.,4american-airlines,24/03/14,LHR-JFK on my way to Rio and I found that the crew were very unpleasant and had a couldn't care attitude. The connecting flight to Rio was cancelled due to technical issues and a hotel was organised but we had a terrible time getting to he hotel as there was no one to guide or direct us. Very unpleasant experience both ways and the food was a joke too - serving a pizza for breakfast! It was take it or leave it as they had no other options. The crew looked so fed up to be there. I am doing the same journey again but this time definitely it will be a different airline.,1american-airlines,21/03/14,"Stewardesses were extremely rude on every flight. I had 2 connections from Jacksonville FL to Long Beach CA and then 3 connecting flights on the return home. My carry on was well within the measurement requirements and every time it fit nicely under the seat in front of me. The bag carried my pillow so it appeared to be full. Upon boarding every flight I was harshly informed that ""it will not fit and would need to be checked."" One lady even tried to take it from me. I had to unnecessarily prove on every flight that it did indeed fit under the seat in front of me. After seeing for her own eyes one stewardess rolled her eyes and walked away. The beverage service was less than mediocre. Not one staff member appeared to be happy to be there.",5american-airlines,19/03/14,I took AA4244 from DCA to ORD on 3/17/2014. Flight arrived on time but there was no space for the flight to park due to the only one bridge being broken. After waiting 45 mins flight finally got a free bridge. Several people missed the connection. AA could arrange the flight to wait for few mins as they already knew the flight was waiting outside for the bridge but they prefer to give us hotel and meal voucher. This has happened several times on my trip. If I could I would not take such an airline again. Very disappointed.,1american-airlines,19/03/14,I would just like to echo the views of A Forrest (Mar 17th). My wife and I have returned from a long weekend in the big apple so endured MAN-JFK return flights over the last few days. The most antiquated substandard long haul flight that I have taken for a long time! I'm not saying that I will never fly AA again but if there is a choice then AA will not be my first!,3american-airlines,17/03/14,3 flights with 3 problems in less than a month. First bad weather cancels flight which can hardly be blamed on the airline. Not being able to even reach an agent to rebook for 48 hours and being forced to use an alternate airline to make meeting. Most definitely can. Second sat on tarmac for an hour waiting quite literally for a piece of paper certifying weight and then being forced to return to gate and refuel when minimum safe fuel line is broken was not fun. Having to literally run to connecting flight is even less fun. Especially when a comfortable wait was programmed into original flight. Third went to check in for overseas flight booked by government and after standing in line (no military bypass in system for check in) was unapologetically and without assistance punted to partner airline to stand in line for another hour. Because people who ticket with AA are just supposed to know this - particularly when standard check in procedures block military travel and leaves you stranded. Do the airlines really think making people wait needlessly and unapologetically is a good thing?,1american-airlines,17/03/14,"Manchester-JFK. Cannot believe there were no monitors in the back of the headrests instead monitors on the ceilings so far away you could barely see. The so called inflight entertainment (1 film for a 8.5 hour flight) broke after 10 minutes of starting and was off for an hour then anyway. When the ""food"" turned up I was given some cold pasta as there was no chicken left so it was this slop or nothing it was inedible so left it. On the way home there was a 2 hour delay and a gate change from 1 to 35. This time I got chicken but service was done in the dark and again only one film for a transatlantic flight so no distractions there or back which meant plenty of clock watching. This was my first time with American airlines and I can honestly say its the most prehistoric long haul flight I've ever had the misfortune to get on.",2american-airlines,14/03/14,I flew from IAH to ORD my next flight was at 9.30 but I couldn't get off the plane because we had no space for the aircraft I told the flight attendant to let them know that I was running late. She didn't care so ended up missing my flight. Poor service poor attitude poor everything!,1american-airlines,13/03/14,"AA51 on two occasions. 6th Jan and 9th March 2014. As a seasoned traveller countless delays and negative experiences I still go about it with a smile. The negative experiences that I have I often just take with a smile. Not so this time. American Airlines provoked me so much on my last flights with them. I travel often in both economy and business as a paying customer. This time I was in business class with ""The New"" American and their 777-300ER. The product is great so is the food and the IFE. But the crew of AA are a disgrace. From the moment I stepped on the airplane an aura of unwelcomeness was hanging in the air. The crew were stressed and did not have time for anything but to run. No smiles nothing mostly just grumpy faces. After a dinner service that took forever to get going and that was served with a slap in the face I went to their famous buffÃ¨t of snacks to have some water and some fruit. As I did that one of the two flight attendants sitting there asked me: ""Didn't you eat already?"" I stood there feeling unwelcome. I don't pay a business class ticket to be met by such an attitude. It is simply incredible how unwelcome AA crews can make you feel on their long-haul flights. I'd much rather have bad food and IFE but a smiling friendly and service minded crew.",1american-airlines,13/03/14,I booked travel 2 months ago for my wedding. The day of the trip American Airlines cancelled the flight and put me and my fiancee on a flight 10hrs later (in different seats) when they had other flights available that would've got us there sooner. After they flew us to our connecting flight they delayed it another hour. I normally fly with Southwest I will never make the mistake of flying American Airlines again.,1american-airlines,12/03/14,Flew NRT-ORD in Business AA 154 on March 10. The seats and service (apart from inflight entertainment) remain not as good than the Japan Airlines flights on the same route but I saw a real effort to improve. I often find Chicago-based AA cabin attendants particularly surly for some reason but this trip I was blessed by having an outstandingly efficient and even pleasant Japanese cabin attendant who looked after the Japanese speakers as well as me very well. The connecting flight to BOS AA 2474 had at least as good cabin crew and the pilot even shook the hands with the passengers in First before the flight started.,8american-airlines,12/03/14,The newer American Airlines triple 7 with the 2-5-2 seating configuration is a very uncomfortable in economy class. On a recent flight from Buenos Aires to Dallas/Ft. Worth my legs were touching the seat in front of me and so were my wife's. I am about 6 feet and my wife is 5'8. The American 767 from Dallas/Ft. Worth to San Francisco had more leg room. I do not recommend long haul flights in the triple7 in the 2-5-2 configuration.,2american-airlines,11/03/14,I no longer fly American. I was Platinum for 12 years but I can no longer deal with their customer service their change fees and their attitudes. Flying on American is tough enough but if you have an American Eagle leg in your trip you are likely to face delays slow baggage service and attitudes that are even worse than that of other American employees. Eagle will also tend to push your price up I have chosen to speak with my wallet and to stop giving AA my money.,2american-airlines,10/03/14,Very bad flight experience. Though I was booked in Business Class the seats and taking care of food preference was horrible. My in seat entertainment system was not working. Also on top of it the control to call the attendant was not working. Even the reading light on the seat was not working for a major portion of the flight I could not read anything. I had in advance booked an Asian Vegetarian meal. I was informed that the meal had not been arranged. My seat was moving I was not sure that the seat was fully in upright position at the time of take off and landing.,1american-airlines,10/03/14,Flew on AA1617 last night from ORD-LAX on a new 737-800 sporting AAs latest interiors all leather seats in First and Coach. The new colors seating and IFE systems are pretty outstanding. My congratulations to AA for continuing to add new aircraft and upgrade their aircraft interiors. It makes for a much more enjoyable flight experience.,10american-airlines,10/03/14,"This is a comment about the ""new"" American Airlines (American/USAir). My wife daughter and 15 month grandson flew USAir Express from Washington National to Louisville yesterday for a special occasion. They took off more than 2 hours late because of a broken toilet on the commuter airline (USAir Express). Today they were scheduled to fly back on American Eagle from Lousville to Washington National on a 1.25pm flight. First flight was delayed until 3.30pm and now cancelled with no alternative until tomorrow. So now they are driving back. We will do everything in our power to avoid flying the ""new"" American.",1american-airlines,07/03/14,I fly about 5-12 times a year so it's not a lot but it's not a little either. I've done international and many within the USA. I have never flown with AA but I will from now on. I usually only fly us air but I'm on a flight from CLT to Dallas/Ft. Worth and it was the most comfortable short distance flight I have taken to date. Other competitors don't even come close. (I'm comparing only to those flights within the USA and mid-size) the seats were comfortable the staff nice and each seat has a TV in front of it. Well done for changing my mind!,9american-airlines,07/03/14,IAH to LGA via Chicago O'Hare on March 6th on a redemption ticket. Both flights were on-time. Easy checking and Priority AAccess helped me to get quickly through security and to board the aircraft early. Very smooth and organize boarding both flights arrived early. Great cabin crew comfortable seats and generous legroom. Definitely recommend flying AA.,10american-airlines,07/03/14,Can not believe they tout new planes yet can't have a consistent onboard experience. I fly 2 to 3 times a week on AA and I never know what my flight will entail. Poor options for entertainment. If you are lucky enough to have internet on a flight you may or may not have the ability to rent a movie or show which I am happy to do. Yet I get on the new airbus which honestly is just as bad as their ancient md-80's and I can either stare at the broken monitor I was given where the sound doesn't work or like the passenger next me the screen was completely broken and would not display correctly. I get on gogo and it won't allow me to rent anything yet surf on a slow and labored internet connection. How can you not bring a consistent options to those that fly you the most?,1american-airlines,06/03/14,Flew on 2/27/14 from LGA to MIA on a US airways code share flight. Aircraft was newish Boeing 737 800. Seats were comfortable with adjustable headrest with plenty of space between my knees and seat in front. They were comparable to United's economy plus seats. Service was friendly and professional. The aircraft had wifi which could be purchased and the bandwidth was more than adequate for getting email and work done. All safety announcements and instructions seem to be pre recorded in a voice with a a neutral calm tone. As is the case in most US domestic they only have beverage service but they give you the whole along with glass as oppose to UA where they only fill the ice filled plastic cup. Inflight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors with requirement to purchase headphones however wifi availability made up for this.,8american-airlines,05/03/14,JFK-MAD return. Both flights on time and fine. 757 used which meant tired outdated and unusable IFE from drop down screens in the aisle. Be warned if in window seat you will not be able to see the entire screen. MCE seating wonderful to provide extra leg room on these long flights. Exit row seat seemed thin ended up sitting on my pillow for most of the flight! Crew on both legs were good return trip they were smiling and engaging. Something not expected often! Food acceptable but let's be honest-nothing to travel for! Multiple drink runs welcomed.,8american-airlines,04/03/14,AA does not care about its customers or understand why getting customers to their destinations on time matters. AA Flight number 132 was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 40 minutes due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft. The AA flight crew knowingly boarded the entire flight of passengers even though they knew the black box/communication box to the flight deck tower was broken and required repair. Many passengers had a connecting flight out of Dallas Fort Worth airport the destination for AA Flight 132. After 30 minutes of waiting with no information the flight crew informed us that the plane had a mechanical issue and the repair was being made. 10 minutes later the flight crew announced that the repair could not be made and the plane would be decommissioned. Asked to de-plane and had to wait another 10 minutes. Finally landed in Dallas. I ran through the airport and we were able to make the second flight (not our originally scheduled flight) and we made it. Flight attendants on this flight (AA Flight number 2467) were not helpful. No crew member helped us move overhead bags to get our bags up or helped communicate to another passenger to move his jacket down or a small bag that should be under such passengers seat. We finally landed in Los Angeles. We lost the chance to get to Honolulu on Saturday February 8 as planned and paid for. After waiting in line we received our voucher for one night at the airport Holiday Inn in Los Angeles and a $39.00 voucher for dinner for 3 people and an $18 voucher for breakfast on Sunday Feb. 9 also for 3 people (in LAX!).,1american-airlines,03/03/14,"SNA-DFW on AA mainline in first class DFW-LFT on AA Eagle in coach. This would have been an on time departure however during a strong storm our B737-800 aircraft was struck by high winds just before push back. Maintenance was called and an inspection was made with no damage noted. The flight crew kept us fully informed and drinks were served in first class during the delay. We finally took off through very turbulent weather. The crew kept us fully informed of the weather conditions as the flight attendants had to remain seated for quite some time due to the turbulence. Once past Palm Springs the ride became very comfortable and dinner was served. The ""teriyaki beef with sugar snap beans and sticky rice"" was unremarkable although the salad and dessert (freshly baked and still warm chocolate chip cookies) were fine. The red wine from Washington state was fine as well. Cabin service was excellent. Due to strong tail winds we were only about 15 minutes late arriving in DFW and I made my connection to LFT via AA Eagle with no problems. Early arrival in LFT and my checked bag arrived on the belt quickly. All in all a terrific job by AA and AA Eagle.",9american-airlines,03/03/14,AA 1122 - horrible plane. Seats were extremely uncomfortable even though the seat next to me was not occupied. If you ever have a choice - never choose this flight from Bogota to Dallas. The in-your-face screen in my seat did not work! None of the crew cared about it.,1american-airlines,26/02/14,Flew from LHR to DFW to make a connection to Mexico. They use the new 777-ER on this Dallas route. It was my first time to fly this aircraft and it's really great. I think it now must be the best business class product on the transatlantic - much better than BA. The seat is really comfortable. Great if you are travelling alone and get a window seat and you have complete privacy. The FA looking after me was very friendly and attentive. The International Terminal D at DFW must be the best international transfer experience in the US better than most European airports. AA system of tagging your baggage straight through to the final destination outside the US (ITI) is excellent.,10american-airlines,26/02/14,This was our first and last time will be flying with AA first with the 2 hour delay that wasn't their fault but we did not get a phone call like other passengers there was no cabin crew when we boarded the plane nor did they do cabin check (both journeys). We asked about upgrading to business class we were told it was full yet there were some empty seats and 2 of the cabin crew were in them. My mother and I both paid Â£75 each for extra leg room yet the 2 sat next us (both journeys again) said they didn't. Boeing 757 UK to JFK several other passengers also complained about how unhelpful the cabin crew were. Will not recommend this service plus delayed 1 hour coming back.,3american-airlines,25/02/14,"Economy PAP-Ft Laud-Dallas-YVR. First leg ok - on time and crew fine. Got caught in Ft Laud customs grubby facility more than 2 hours to get to an officer (5 on duty) - but US Citizens breezed through their own line while the rest of us shuffled forward. I politely mentioned I was going to miss my connection (no sympathy) and was told ""be quiet and stay in line."" Got to baggage claim and another massive line to leave - AA agent tried to rescue me and was rudely treated by customs and I was put back in line (I said nothing). From there on a gong show with AA - later and later flights missed connections no one to help at the gates sent into a line for help and told ""we are closing - sorry"" leave security and come back in and see if an AA check-in is open. Got some polite help from one AA staff - ended up stuck overnight. Next leg to Vancouver in a brand new plane with TVs in the seat (I am used to that on Air Canada) - many passenger asked for - PA announced ""this is a new plane we don't know how to operate the TVs either - if you need help ask a young person they might know."" Cabin crew were surly and short with very polite passengers. Never ever AA again! Arrival customs in YVR in spacious and attractive area with passport scanners and pleasant officers.",1american-airlines,25/02/14,I am still not a big fan of AA but it looks like that they are now working harder to provide to their pax some kind of decent flight experience. Flew recently SJO-MIA-DEN/RT. On SJO-MIA still operating the old 757 but with a refurbished cabin at least. MIA-DEN newish 737-800. Nice aircraft. Ground handling efficient and friendly. They assigned me an exit row and main cabin exit seats for free without asking. All pilots talked to the pax providing a lot of flight info. The winner was the 757 Captain of the flight MIA-SJO. After appreciating his clients over the mike he also took the time to bid a farewell to every pax exiting the plane with a Thank You and a smile. Even though their inflight service still leaves a lot to wish it is a nice manner to show each passenger the value they deserve. Overall a good experience and I'll fly AA again.,5american-airlines,25/02/14,Chicago to Dubai Frequent Flyer on American via LH. Been a loyal customer since the 1980's. It's really a shame how this airline has degraded. The planes I fly are always really old virtually no entertainment system at all if it even works there's no leg room and seats are often old smelly and sometimes broken. On one flight the bathroom floor was cracked. Staff are always great but they have a really poor product to work with and their frustration shows. After all these years finally had enough will be checking out from American after next flight such a shame.,1american-airlines,25/02/14,DFW-SEA in new 737 which was refreshing compared to previous AA flights on old planes however the new seats are cramped and feel more uncomfortable than older aircraft. In seat VOD is a huge improvement however it appears that AA will be charging for this in future along with earphones and food. Another downside is that the screen does not adjust. Even with the seat in front not reclined the viewing angle for a person of average height is poor and soon results in a neck ache. There is the question of service or more particularly lack there-of and attitude. This flight was no exception and service was delivered abruptly and with only occasional customer respect. I asked for a cup of tea (complimentary) and was given a cup of hot water and a tea bag on the side. With AA it's a case of get on board (sometimes you're welcomed other times you're not) sit down pay for everything other than basics (and if you want water mid flight go get it but be sure to ask permission if you're not interrupting the staff talking to each other at the back) don't complain then get off (and you might get thanked for your custom from an FA who might be sat on one of the seats - although at least the Captain often thanks you). On the plus side this flight was very punctual and baggage delivered quickly but that speaks more to the efficiency of others.,3american-airlines,24/02/14,Flight Zurich to JFK. Very old 767 plane - 21 years - showing excessive wear and tear. Dirty torn carpets and seat covers. Such an old and poorly maintained plane does not feel safe. No entertainment system other than a shaky old style TV hung from the ceiling. No magazines or newspapers provided (other than the thin airline's magazine). Food quality was average - liquor costs extra. The only commendable thing was the friendly crew and the fact that the plane was at most half full. Apparently the word about these run down planes has spread and few people choose AA on a route which also has a direct flight from Swiss. AA terminal at JFK is catastrophic. Luggage takes almost an hour to arrive and when departing the wait time at security was exceeded 90 minutes.,2american-airlines,24/02/14,"MAN-JFK. Used Oneworld (BA) reward miles. I had the lowest expectations having flown AA many times in the past both business and pleasure although not for some years. Check-in and security were the usual Manchester Airport slick and fast why can't Heathrow learn from them? On boarding we were met by a smiling and effusive purser who was greeting every passenger. Don't know if my BA Gold Card had anything to do with it but we were seated just behind Business in extra leg room seats. Yes the plane was an antique and had no seat back entertainment which almost beggars believe but it was clean and all seats and trays appeared to work for AA an achievement! We departed on time and arrived on time. We were served the preposterously named ""International Flagship"" lunch which was actually not bad for economy. Apart from the excellent purser the cabin crew went through the motions but were not rude or bad tempered which is a major improvement. US immigration was fast and the staff actually smiled. AA cabin crew and US immigration staff smiling what is the world coming to? Overall we were pleasantly surprised and would use again for the benefit of flying direct.",7american-airlines,24/02/14,"LAX-LHR return in Biz. AA put their new 777-300ER on this route and I have to say that they are nearly on the top of the market with this product. Lounge at LAX - not so great I am EP the highest but have to admit the lounge is lacking lots of food options. There were nearly none except few sandwiches. Compared to BA First class in Terminal 3 which is not their best the AA just does not stack up. The aircraft itself is great. Biz has walk-up bar which if the flight attendants are not too lazy has constant food. And this is where it becomes tricky. Flight attendants on AA are hit and miss. I flew them 5 times in the past few months. The same route. Sometimes you get great serving people who really care and would do anything for you and then you get a lady like I did who when I walked up to the bar in the middle of the flight and asked for a glass of water - since there was none anywhere had to close her game on her iPad annoyingly lifted her eyes and proceeded to look. When she found the bottle she slammed it on the bar and said "" You will be able to pour it yourself - I hope"". Seat itself is great. I recommend row 5 window - it has an extra space to store your stuff. Plenty of room to stock things up. Food - really great for biz class they elevated their game with wines as well. I can't fault them for anything in terms of hard product. The choices of movies - great. I am comparing to my recent trip on BA which had about 1/3 of movies. That really surprised me. All in all AA is trying but it has to do it faster better and more efficiently.",8american-airlines,21/02/14,From reading the list of reviews I don't understand why anyone would fly with American Airlines I however am military and am forced to fly what is given to me. Today 21 Feb14 flying on orders from San Antonio to Fort Walton Beach I was forced to pay to have my baggage checked for the first time in 8 years. I fly often and usually have 1 to 2 bags that weigh from 60 to 100lbs and have never been asked to pay. AA seems to have different requirement on baggage weights from state to state. I had no problem with baggage fees leaving Fort Walton but was charged 125 dollars on my return flight departing San Antonio.,2american-airlines,21/02/14,March 2014 AA 39 London Heathrow to Miami. AA2438 Miami to San Jose. 16th April 2014 AA 353 San Jose to Miami. AA38 Miami to London Heathrow. Haven't even travelled with AA yet but already we are thoroughly disillusioned. Have travelled business class with many different airlines over the decades and never experienced such disregard. For personal reasons we need a window seat and aisle so the moment we book a flight we go online and book our seats. These are always without fail honoured. But American Airlines have already thrown us out of our pre-books seats 3 times relocating us in inappropriate seats and separated! Each time we have re-books seats but today find they have moved us again and suddenly all other seats are full! We phoned only to be told that they were not prepared to move other passengers despite them being single travellers even though they had moved us three times without reference to our wishes. We are no longer looking forward to our journey and will be avoiding AA in the future.,1american-airlines,18/02/14,Flight 2048 MIA to JFK Feb 15th in Coach extra. JFK was recovering from a snow-storm but that doesn't forgive the appalling service delivered by AA to passengers stuck for 8 hours on what should be a 3-hour flight. 1 hour late departure ATC orders no blame. 45 minutes holding pattern somewhere off the coast around DC a further delay. Running out of fuel so we have to land in Philadelphia. Quick refuel and push-back only to stop halfway through because the tow-bar has broken. Then return to the gate for one passenger to deplane no explanation but efficiently and quickly done. Land at JFK at 10.45 pm. No gate held on taxiway get assigned gate but access blocked by de-icing an outbound plane assigned another gate so taxi a couple of hundred yards then stop. Eventually move to gate but another 15-minute delay. Eventually get to the gate and disembark at 12.30 am. Wait for baggage is interminable and at first there is no information as to which carousel it's coming on. I get mine at about 1.50 am and that's marked Priority. In 8 hours on the plane there was one drinks service no additional refreshment except for a hand-out of an oat bar. Inadequate communication from the flight deck as to what was happening once we'd landed at JFK. Appalling behaviour and lack of customer care.,1american-airlines,17/02/14,Business Class from Dublin to JFK. Not a great service at all. When we got on the plane the pre-flight drinks were sitting on the table of one of the business class seats. Everything rushed. Hostesses do just the bare minimum required. Earphones faulty. Had them changed and the new ones didn't work. Turns out the socket for the earphones in my seat was broken. So no inflight entertainment for me for the whole flight unless I was prepared for visuals only. Then got a cup of coffee in a filthy cup. Admirals Lounge in JFK is a joke. Pretzels cheese carrots apples some juice and coffee. That's it. You have to pay for anything else at airport prices. Then they looked for $10.50 for a glass of wine. I thought the girl behind the bar was joking. She wasn't. She reluctantly told me that one wine was complimentary and she begrudgingly served it. How can they justify charging Business prices and provide such a sub-standard product? Will never fly with them again.,2american-airlines,17/02/14,We traveled Jan 15 - Feb. 14. Our plane was delayed for an hour in LA and another 45 minutes in Chicago. There were only a few snacks available on our flight the TV didn't work properly and when we got home to Flint MI our luggage wasn't there and there was no reason for this because we had to wait for an hour on the tarmac before taking off.,1american-airlines,14/02/14,Would not recommend flying American. Yesterday morning I called their customer service/flight status line and requested the status of my flight from Cleveland to Charlotte. The automated system told me it was on time and after I selected the option even texted me a copy of the status stating the same thing. I drove to the airport paid to park went to the counter to check my bag and the counter clerk who was quite rude and non-empathetic said your flight was cancelled yesterday. Meanwhile I receive a call from my wife who says she received a call at home stating my connecting flight out of Charlotte had been delayed but the counter clerk had already told me that flight was cancelled too. No call was ever made to tell me either flight had been canceled. I am sure they would like to blame this on the merger or maybe even the severe weather and quantity of flight cancellations but that is nonsense.,1american-airlines,12/02/14,"Flew 2/9/2014 from St. Martin to IAH changing in Miami. We were in the first part (""extra legroom"" section) of the Main Cabin. On the first leg AA was sold out of Meals for Purchase by Row 11. (Dozens of rows behind - no food upset travelers). During the 3 hour calm flight attendants came down the row once to offer a beverage. Zero customer service. Extremely unpleasant crew. During the Miami layover had to retrieve luggage due to Customs. Plane landed at 6.42pm. Got our luggage at 8.05pm! Others still waiting after us. Baggage Claim personnel gave zero customer service. On the second leg into IAH attendants told everyone that someone forgot to put any liquor/beer on the flight. And again attendants came down the aisle once during the 2.5hr flight to offer a beverage (juice water soda only). Zero customer service. AA has a long ways to go in the Customer Service department.",2american-airlines,12/02/14,2/9/14 LAX to Chicago. I am extremely disappointed with American Airlines customer service. Staff were unfriendly and rude during the boarding and ticketing process. During the check-in process I received a message that I had not chosen a seat and was asked to pay an additional $68 for an upgraded seat. From the mobile phone the check-in process could not be completed until this upgrade was purchased. At the airport during the self check-in it was clear a seat had been chosen and no upgrade was needed at that time. Why are the two systems not compatible with each other? During boarding they allowed all passengers to board who did not have roller bags. This then resulted in less space for these roller bags during the boarding process. Flight attendant's allowed customers to place small bags and coats in the overhead compartments. When it came time to board the roller bags there was not enough room for these bags. This could have been avoided had the staff asked these other customers to please remove smaller items and place under the seat. Instead they were then rude to those with roller bags who did not have enough space accusing them of delaying the flight further. This seems like a rather inefficient process and one that should be reviewed to provide better customer service to those flying on American.,1american-airlines,11/02/14,Traveled DFW-NRT over Christmas break in 2012. Old 777-200 but the cabin was maintained pretty well and clean. Boarded last because of a late connection whisked into an almost empty first class. Food service was quick and good the steak I ordered was surprisingly good. An old flight attendant turned out to be a very funny and nice man who did everything to make the flight better and knew when to leave me alone (sleeping). Personal TV screen was not of the highest quality but personal none the less and thus enjoyable. Lay flat seat worked just fine and the ability to swivel and work on a desk was a plus. Calm flight except for circling for 30 mins before landing at Narita.,9american-airlines,10/02/14,"ORD to IAH. Check in was a bit of a hassle since the American Airlines staff directed us to a machine kiosk that was malfunctioning. After that hurdle was crossed a slew of others slowly came our way. Our original flight to IAH Houston was scheduled for 3.15pm at 2.55pm (local time) and arriving at 5.55pm the gate attendant told us that the flight had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. We soon learned that the gate had been changed no announcement by telecom only by looking at the airport television screens did we figure this out. The new departure time was 3:34pm but that didn't happen either so the staff delayed the flight again to 4.04pm. As 4.15pm approached everyone was finally seated on this haggard and small CR7 jet. As we were about to leave the gate the pilot said there needed to be some maintenance and that it would take ""5 minutes"" to complete. 5 minutes passed and then 10 and then 20. By this time it was 4.25pm and we had yet to leave the gate. At 4.45pm we began taxing onto the runway when another problem arose. There apparently was an electrical failure and maintenance needed to be done once again. Back to the gate we go and by now its 5.10pm. Maintenance fixed the problem and off we go! We finally take off at 5.45pm.",2american-airlines,10/02/14,Booked a flight for wife stepdaughter and grandson to visit me in San Francisco from Indianapolis. (IND to SFO). The first leg to Dallas was delayed. They spent 4 hours waiting in Indy to catch a flight to Chicago. Flight from Chicago to San Francisco was delayed. What normally takes me 6 hours with Delta has now taken them 15 hours. When I had long delays with Delta they rebooked on another carrier for direct flights. AA = Anguishing Anxiety.,american-airlines,10/02/14,DFW-BOG on A319: Feb 7th. This aircraft should not fly internationally. Not on a 5-hour route anyway. First class is a complete joke with only 2 rows. The bulkhead is extraordinarily uncomfortable and the last and second row simply horrible as seat cannot recline because it is placed physically against the partition between first and coach cabins. Entertainment? Lots of options If the controls work (I was in two seats and none worked properly). All these in addition to an over two-hours delay (excused by the nasty weather in the USA the last couple of weeks). What did not have an excuse at all was the extremely dirty plane (bathroom was not even flushed when first passengers boarded). AA flights to Colombia have shown substandard service and equipment for the longest. I hope all the positive changes in AA's culture that have started being evident after the merger with USAirways also benefit USA-Colombia travelers. In the meantime my personal advice to AA's Bogota-bound travelers: do not pay Business or First. AA is generally a good value in the back of the plane but not worth pay premium cabin for a substandard product and service into Bogota. I recommend AA anywhere but Colombia-bound routes.,1american-airlines,07/02/14,BOS-DFW-MEX and return MEX-MIA-BOS. 1/21/14 - 2/1/14. AA Platinum Desk gracefully accommodated our request for a departure a day before scheduled because of impending snow storm on 1/22. All flights on time or ahead upgraded using 500 miles awards on two of the legs. Service in first was prompt and cheerful. Food was fine-just the right menu for the time of day. Boarding well organized. Equipment well-maintained. All in all a very pleasant experience.,10american-airlines,05/02/14,We took our first American flight in 15 years to see if they improved and boy were we wrong. We took a 45 minute MAD-PUJ via MIA and return. All flights on time check in fast and easy. Priority boarding. On board very old planes on all sectors very nice flight crew. Their Business Class still have the inclined lay flat seats can feel a little uncomfortable for a night flight. But for other positions is OK. Food better than usual and nice selection of wines and drinks. For the first time connections at MIA went smooth and fast.,8american-airlines,04/02/14,We took our first American flight in 15 years to see if they improved and boy were we wrong. We took a 45 minute flight from Beaumont TX to Dallas TX. We were coming back the next morning the same time. The time for our check- in came and passed as we did not get the normal check-in email. When we checked our status they had canceled our flight. They did not even notify us to this. Then as we were waiting on the phone for Customer service we drove all the way to the airport. They sent us to Dallas fully aware that we were not going to get back home. They placed us on another flight 5 hours later than the original flight. Then I looked online to see what was going on. They weather was around 32 degrees. 281 flights had been cancelled in Dallas. At the time I looked 211 of those 281 were American Airlines.,american-airlines,03/02/14,Flew Las Vegas - JFK 28 Jan 2014. If it wasn't for our crew the flight would've been miserable all the crew smiled from boarding to landing I was expecting the opposite the Flight attendant looking after us in the front was excellent he was always in the cabin offering drinks and so on only complaint is the seats and IFE after coming off a Virgin America first class flight they are way beyond AA's seats. The food was below par way below par that I couldn't eat it where as I could eat almost anything.,4american-airlines,31/01/14,LAX-NRT Economy cabin B777-200. Have to say one of my worst experiences in a very long time. Were told before boarding the IFE was broken so expect no TV for the next 12 hrs. Boarded an old plane with dirty cabins. Blanket and candy wrappers in my/ my wife's seat pockets. To my right on the other side of the aisle there was a lady with an empty seat next to her. She wanted to fold up the armrest so she could sleep across but the armrest would not stay up which was later solved by flight attendants using masking tape. My reading light was broken. American Airlines truly lived up to what US airlines are famous for - grumpy flight attendants shouting at foreign passengers who merely wanted to find out more about the food they were being served. And while on food absolutely horrible and I am sure anyone on that flight would have described it as such. Same chicken and rice dish for both meals but called different names. Same sauce same meat but one with carrots and onions. Not asking for Michelin- starred gourmet meals but this was just miles apart from coach class catering at other airlines I have flown with for example Cathay or Japan Airlines. If they can do it why can't American. Flight attendants delivering service chewing gum. Signs they were getting a tad too relaxed about their work environment. I am a frequent traveller and do not often (in fact my first time) post reviews but I really think flight deserves American's attention.,2american-airlines,29/01/14,LAX to LHR AA 136 27th Jan. New AA Business Class. Lounge very relaxing and bar served a variety of drinks. Nibbles were ok and more substantial food was available for a fee. Once on board this is the new lie flat AA product and feels more like a first class seat than business. Flight staff were very attentive and the service on the 9 hour overnight flight was great. Amazing food great entertainment on a large screen and the seat is great for working and sleeping too. A decent pillow and fleece blanket are provided. THe walk up bar with snacks during the flight was great as were the massive toilets in which you can change into more comfy wear for sleeping pj's are not provided. Bose headphones made for cinema sound and the amenity kit was of a good quality too. Food servings being on an American carrier are generous. All in all an excellent product and this does give Emirates and Etihad a run for their money as one of the best in the sky - well worth a try.,9american-airlines,29/01/14,Originally meant to flu YUL-LGA/JFK-CDG on Dec 24th 2013 and CDG-JFK-YUL on Jan 5th 2014 but a lot of changes occurred! Our JFK-CDG was cancelled due to weather in Paris. Flight from YUL-LGA was finally cancelled at the gate they rescheduled us on Air Canada to BOS (CRJ50) then British Airways to LHR. AA agents were ok and all speck fluent French. On the BOS-LHR flight (B747-400) they put us in premium economy seating was good but meal disgusting. Arrived at LHR around 4.50am we had our CDG flight scheduled at 3pm but British Airways found places for us on an earlier flight (A320). Our return wasn't cancelled as we entered the plane a B757-200 wifi- equipped we and 10 other passengers were told to go back to the gate. Given vouchers 800USD each Hyatt hotel and complimentary meals. The next morning staff helped us find the best flight. CDG-MIA-YUL. The 10 hours long CDG-MIA flight was on an outdated B767-300 but was really clean. Food was better than BA but still not as AF or Egyptair. No individual TV of course but good seat. I was able to sleep. The rest of the trip MIA-YUL was on an B737-800. Normal flight free beverages and everything else we needed to pay for. Great staff. I would fly them again.,8american-airlines,28/01/14,AA47 LHR-ORD in Business - maybe 70% full on Saturday lunchtime. 777-200 with 2-3-2 business class. Attentive crew a mixture of experienced and new who showed a real pride in the service they offered. Good concise communication from the flight deck. Food OK wine reasonable (although does show cost cutting vs 4 years ago when I last flew this route). Cabin showing a little wear and tear but generally OK and serviceable. IFE showing its age but again perfectly OK for an 8 hour stretch. Half the price of BA (although BA were in gouging mode because the flight was booked within 2 weeks of departure). On time departure 10 minutes early arrival. A decent product when delivered by a crew who care as was the case this time.,8american-airlines,28/01/14,Have flown AA F GRU-MIA-GRU several times. It is true that AA has pyjamas in First and better linen but still: cabin is always a bit dirty food is pathetic for first class with $8 wines and cheap whisky. Service has improved a bit they try but far from being a real F experience. On arrival especially at GRU priority tags are just part of your luggage decor: I have lost count of how many times I had to wait much more than coach passengers for my bags. The TAM product is far better and as they join Oneworld soon goodbye AA.,2american-airlines,28/01/14,"JFK to Heathrow. The flight was needlessly delayed by 3hrs at first not because of any weather or anything but just because it was not ""ready"" yet and then after we were boarded it was again delayed by 2 hrs. After we landed in Heathrow people who missed flights were not given any sort of lodging etc. This is totally unexpected from an international airline which is considered first rate. I write this comment to let people know what they can expect if they plan on a long flight with AA.",1american-airlines,28/01/14,LHR-ORD AA 91 14th January - a good comfortable flight and the food was reasonable. Excellent flight attendants very friendly and helpful. DFW-LHR AA78 - Business - 20th January. Although the business cabin was full the seat was very comfortable and the service impeccable. Very friendly FA's. This was my 3rd multi sector trip from London with AA and every time I have found the whole experience to far exceed my expectations.,9american-airlines,25/01/14,Traveled from Barcelona to NY flight # 67 and paid $89 for what we believed were extra legroom seats. Seats were cramped boarded last no space in any nearby bins for hand luggage plane was ancient didn't even have individual air controls. AA states we booked 'preferred seats' which merely allowed us to choose our seats for $89!,1american-airlines,25/01/14,I have flown MIA-JFK on an old B767-300. Flight was full. Seat very old but comfortable and pitch was ok. Entertainment only through overhead screens. I was shocked that this aircraft had the new hatrack design only for premium cabins Economy cabin still had the 90's hatrack design which a) looks very old and b) does not have enough room for everyone. Only non-alcoholic drink service for this 2hr flight. Staff very unprofessional. There seems to be an inconsistency in their uniform. One female flight attendant was wearing - what seemed to be her personal apron that featured dozens of US flags next to each other. After landing in JFK we had to hold at a remote stand before our gate was available. As usual passengesr were standing up and retrieving their bags from the overhead bins despite the captain making an announcement to remain seated. No flight attendant took any action only a Captain in American Airlines uniform travelling as a passenger made assertive requests for everyone to remain seated to which everyone then complied. Also saw a male flight attendant making a call on his mobile phone during taxiing to the gate. Very unprofessional!,5american-airlines,23/01/14,Ghastly flight in First Class on AA from PVG to LAX. The flight attendants were very nice. The seat was horrible. Uncomfortable. Had really poor leather padding a very weird need to press a latch under the arm of the seat first in order to operate seat controls. When in the bed/sleep position the seat had a bulging ridge in the middle hinge that made it impossible to lie on. There was no privacy because the seats had no enclosures or partial walls just wide open so that all the lights noise smells of the cabin were omnipresent. Bad lighting tiny hard to move video screen dirty floor cheap broken plastic laminate console patched poorly with silicon putty etc. It was like a really bad business class. Actually I've flown several times in AA's sub marginal business class and as bad as they are the seat padding is actually superior to the first class seats. Guess anyone who tolerates this service has never flown Cathay Pacific. Their biz class is outstanding. Every seat with an aisle seats constructed to provide lots of privacy good lighting headphones mirror private cabinet lots of room really comfortable lie flat seat. I used 67.5 thousand miles for my lousy AA flight.,2american-airlines,22/01/14,American Airlines flight 940 on January 3 2014 in Economy from Santiago Chile to Miami. No personal TV like most foreign airlines no headphones available (only for sale) wine and beer for sale only only one choice of meal flight attendants who don't look presentable no free copy of the Wall Street Journal or local business newspaper no after dinner spirits no ear plugs and eye shades and the seat pocket in front had trash from the previous passenger. The aircraft must have been one of the oldest I've flown in years. I will continue avoiding AA as much as I can.,1american-airlines,20/01/14,Based on a 3 day trip from BWI-DFW-SFO-ORD-BWI in first class I was pleasantly surprised and see AA as a much improved airline. Even though the first flight was cancelled due to a mechanical problem getting myself re-routed was painless though check in staff in BWI were not particularly helpful and if I did not have an app that showed me all my options I may not have had such a good experience. Two of the planes were new 737's FA's were attentive and friendly but still professional (shocking in a US airline). They tried to remember passengers' names and one gets the sense that AA is studying the premier international airlines. Food was fine but not memorable. The AA hubs I passed through all had their own personality but there was a consistency. DFW was friendly SFO professional and ORD a little gruff. The Admirals Club in each airport was good with very helpful professional staff. There is not much food or entertainment but that's not important to me in a domestic airport lounge. Reading other reviews I am reminded of my past experiences with AA and I am hopeful that my experience was a harbinger.,8american-airlines,20/01/14,AA79 30th Dec. AA50 8th Jan. I flew AA to PHX from LHR via DFW. Had a 772 on the way out and a 77W on the way back the internal flights were on an MD80. On all flights the service was excellent and on AA50 was quite outstanding. I was expecting very average flights but was hugely impressed with all aspects from start to finish. I would avoid row 1 on the 77W because on light invasion from the galley.,10american-airlines,17/01/14,ORD-LHR on 12/01/14 (QR 5288 - Qatar Airways code share). Flown AA many times overall impression has never been wonderful - usually met expectations though. This flight however was a shocker. Clapped out 767. Old CRT screens from the 90's hanging from the ceilings. Each one in the cabin had a different colour tinge. Meals were ok nothing to rave or complain about. Hostesses were surly with a bad attitude. Passenger next to my wife asked for a cup of coffee and my wife very politely asked for a cup of tea as well. Hostess snapped that she couldn't remember two things at once. Very unimpressive crew about as friendly as rattlesnakes.,2american-airlines,17/01/14,Currently flying from Boston to Austin (via Dallas) on AA. Flights have been on time and aircraft condition is not bad. However we are flying with our 3 year old twins who are actually very good travelers and have found that AA is not family friendly at all. They do not offer any pre boarding for families with small children. We travel with carseats for the kids because we find that this keeps them calm and contained throughout the flight a benefit for all on board but this takes a few minutes for us to put into the seats when we get on the plane and is incredibly difficult to do with many other travelers simultaneously boarding. So when they oddly did not call families for pre boarding on this flight we went up to the front during one of the many other pre boarding categories (carrying our carseats and our tired kids walking) and asked if we could pre board. We were told that we could not that others had paid for this service and we would have to wait on the side. We waited as instructed and when we got on we found that most of the plane had somehow already boarded and it was extremely difficult to get set up. We got no offers of help from any staff members. This is the least family friendly airline we have ever flown hope we won't ever have to fly it again - we fly a lot even with the kids will try to avoid AA in the future. Also in flight entertainment was broken on our of our flights.,4american-airlines,16/01/14,"BCN-MIA on AA 113 26 December in economy. Plane - 767 - dirty scruffy and well used. No seat back screens and on the overhead screens the first film started before the crew handed out ear phones - they were too busy preparing their sleeping quarters. Food dismal and when I went to the galley to ask for some water I was told ""Wait 10 minutes and we will be round"". But the main issue was safety. No pre take off safety check and on landing 2 emergency exit rows I could see were full of luggage on the floor the occupants on one had ear phones in and their Ipads on window blinds were shut and all this less than 2 metres away from a steward. Disgraceful. The staff were the worst I have ever had and to top it all they took 3 days to deliver our luggage. Never again will I fly with American. If I could give a zero rating I would.",1american-airlines,16/01/14,"MIA-JFK on 7/1/2014 on AA 1510. As with my 2 previous reports dreadful staff who did no safety checks and again blinds down and some setbacks not up. A dismal old dirty plane - 757 - which must have been 20-30 years old. No info provided prior to landing 're connections and when I asked how to get from T8 to T7 was told ""ask in the terminal"". I was so pleased that our final leg was with BA. And to cap it all American lost my Wife's luggage again. Why BA and other airlines have codeshare arrangements with this dismal appalling airline is beyond me.",1american-airlines,16/01/14,SKB-MIA 27/12/2013 on AS 1009. Poor service with no safety checks on take off or landing. Luggage in emergency exit rows and blinds down. We landed 25 minutes early but then had to wait over 1 hour to hook on to the terminal. On dismantling (it was at night) all the lights went out. The crew did nothing no torches at all and to cap it all they were laughing. AA never again.,2american-airlines,16/01/14,"MAD-DFW Business: Every single aspect of the flight is mediocre and lagging well behind competition. Tatty 767-300ER with 90s interior (claustrophobic even in Business). Caution: if you assume that travelling Business means you can relax and board the last on this Madrid-Dallas route you are in for a huge shock. All overhead compartments designed last century are not capable of storing vertically standard 22"" hand carry and as a result they get filled quickly. Crew unhelpful preferring to watch the chaos instead of assisting. Entertainment is only provided by Samsung Galaxy distributed by the Crew but at least the headset is high end (BOSE). Food is the only consolation tasting above average. Did not check any luggage due to fear of losing it at DFW. And here is the final kicker: Admiral lounge at DFW gives you a coupon valid for one drink only the very first time I was treated like a homeless at a Business Lounge. Avoid at all costs.",3american-airlines,15/01/14,AA 57 LHR-MIA 31 Dec. Inflight service in First Class seemed friendly enough however the food and beverage suffered by comparison with British Airways. AA serves Dewar's Scotch $20/litre BA Johnnie Walker Blue Label $200/litre. But certainly AA seats while older were lie-flat and comfortable in comparable pods. Where AA fails wretchedly is on the ground in baggage claim and in passing through security in Miami where there is no 'Fast Track' access to ongoing flights. For two years in a row despite flying International First Class with baggage checked and tagged 'Priority' by the international departure airport I waited nearly an hour for the bags in Miami with no American personnel in the baggage claim area to assist and no out source baggage company access to American computers. The result is that a missed or delayed international arriving bag must be reported outside customs and security to AA's baggage service office which does not have access to bags inside customs!,2american-airlines,14/01/14,AA27 ICN to DFW. 20/12/2013. First off Incheon Airport is a gem and it is easy access via express train from Seoul Station. On arrival at the check in we found a line that was moving along nicely. We arrived at the counter as a family of 3. I had a separate ticket as I was travelling back on a different date from my family. There was a hiccup with my ticket as they could not find the leg from DFW to AUS and we were travelling together. It took the check in lady quite a while to find it but we stood patiently as she was trying very hard. She finally had to give in and get a supervisor to help. All the while the other agents kept the line moving along and no one was stuck. The check in staff were all very apologetic and the supervisor finally found my ticket. She noticed that I am a Platinum level traveler and said that she would try to upgrade us all to Business Class. She was successful at it and we were given the upgrade. This made a huge difference as we were on our way home for Christmas and were not looking forward to that long flight in economy. The flight was 100% booked solid and not an empty seat was available. The staff were attentive and gracious. They went out of their way to ensure that our 12 year old son was comfortable and had plenty to eat and drink. Have to say that this was a very good experience from AA. Only drawback is that the entertainment system needs an upgrade. Screens are small and not a huge selection for an 11 hour flight.,10american-airlines,14/01/14,EWR-MIA-SXM. On first leg late arriving aircraft meant a delayed departure and a dirty plane. Flight was saved by excellent FA. Second leg late again no pre departure beverage uninterested FA/crew and filthy bathroom. Food service is rushed and fair at best.,4american-airlines,13/01/14,Flew from McCarron (Vegas) to Chicago to Manchester (England). After delays Vegas to Chicago (because of snow) staff at Chicago did everything they possibly could to get us a flight to Manchester. Ended up flying on time due to their professionalism. Worked hard for all passengers. The cases were delivered next day at least we were on time and cases delivered to the house.,10american-airlines,13/01/14,FRA to DFW on 1/10/14. Wife and children (well behaved and quiet) coming back home. No special meal request. Cabin crew went past them on two occasions once during the beverage service and once during the meal service without stopping to ask if they wanted something to eat or drink. They were not even sleeping. Worse was when my wife called them back the flight attendants acted all surprised that my wife and children actually wanted to eat or drink anything! Yes on a 11 hour flight. Incredible.,1american-airlines,13/01/14,Trip from Hamilton Bermuda - JFK-IND on January 2 2014. Flight arrived at JFK at 10.40 am and supposed to take- off to IND at 3 pm. Without any announcement or explanation flight has been delayed until 8pm when snow storm started then airplane was de-iced after which it returned to the gate and pilots left. Passengers were given alternative flights the next day - we got 2 tickets on Delta and told there are no vouchers for the delay. We booked on our own a hotel in NYC and next day all flights were still grounded. AA kept us on the phone for hours until we called Delta who changed the ticket for us and we flew the next day home.,1american-airlines,13/01/14,Flew from Recife Brazil to Miami. This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. The check-in experience was such a demonstration of incompetence and bad manners by the counter staff. Both the ground and cabin staff were not helpful and rude. They seriously need to undergo training in customer service. They were 11 passengers in Business class cabin and they'd already run out of Beef and seafood by the time they asked me for my choice of food. The food was very bad. The seat was old and the entertainment system did work for some passengers. The staff disappeared by the time they take away the food.,1american-airlines,13/01/14,I travel internationally very frequently on business and holiday. My recent flights with American Airlines between London and New York were the worst in years. Rude unhelpful ground staff a website that wouldn't process seat selections filthy planes and truly disgusting bathrooms. Of the seven different airlines I travelled with in the last 2 months American was the worst. The flight crew were also noisy and talked for hours during an overnight flight. I will not use them again.,2american-airlines,13/01/14,As part of a One World American Airlines codeshare with Malaysia Airlines my family and I traveled on AA from West Palm Beach (B737-800) Chicago (B767-300 winglet) London 2 Jan and was completely satisfied despite the delays due to weather in Chicago. 3.5 hours delay in West Palm Beach and another 2.5 hours delay in Chicago. Both flight were packed. The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew made the journey pleasant. The breakfast prior to landing in London was made up of just one tiny croissant and a small cup of yoghurt. Their aircraft's are old and their IFE very ancient. Do not have a high expectation and you will be fine.,5american-airlines,10/01/14,ORD-YYZ-LGA-ORD Jan 3-6. Flight out to Toronto was fine. Delayed a bit in Chicago but landed on-time. Flight attendants friendly and love AA's new E-175 jets. Return was on the day the huge freeze hit the Midwest. Morning flight to ORD cancelled and put on 9.15am flight. That was delayed a few times then cancelled. Went back to the ticket counter where the agent put me on the next available flight Tuesday night (36 hours later). I asked to be routed through NYC but she said I had to deal with the ExPlt desk for that. After 2 hours on hold for the ExPlt desk (completely ridiculous but with the storm issues expected) I got a friendly agent who booked me on the 12.55pm to LGA then Tuesday flight to Chicago. YYZ-LGA flight an hour late with only 8 passengers aboard. Great flight attendants - lots of humor. Landed in LGA and went to AA desk to see if there was any flight leaving for ORD that night. Only one was scheduled (6 cancelled) and she got me a seat in coach - was very happy. At the boarding gate got my upgrade by an excellent gate agent who had a fun attitude in dealing with all the craziness at the gate. Good flight to ORD - had a nice squash gnocchi and salad. Cookies offered also. Landed 15 min ahead of schedule as there were no planes landing at ORD. It was a bad weather period but I think AA did a good job.,9american-airlines,09/01/14,Flew Business Class from Santiago Chile to Dallas/Ft Worth on a 777. I fly First and Business Class on airlines around the world and I don't have a problem at all with these Biz Class seats and amenities. Even though the seats are angled and not lie-flat I slept like a baby and found the different positions very comfortable. The IFE selection is minimal and not competitive with other airlines but it was decent for the 9.5 hr flight - besides meal time and sleeping took up a big chunk of the flight anyway. Dinner was good with the traditional AA sundae served at the end. This was an 11.10pm departure on an overnight flight so the meal time is odd but I was glad they offered full options. The crew were fine - your average run-of-the-mill crew who have been flying for 40+ years. They don't make any effort to make the Biz Class experience special. AA service levels are average at best and can't come close to what is offered with the international airlines. The Admirals Club in Santiago was crowded and food selection poor. Not recommended.,7american-airlines,09/01/14,"PAN-MIA-LHR. This flight was delayed and delayed with no information forthcoming. We were eventually informed that it was due to a late incoming flight. The delay was so long that we were eventually told that the flight had to be cancelled because the crew were out of time and they did not have a replacement crew available. We were then told that we would be taken to a hotel room for the night and rescheduled for the next day. The staff did not follow this up with any action and eventually we found out why. They had miraculously found a replacement crew so the flight was back on. Even then we were given the option of flying or staying in a hotel. By now the flight was 6 hours late. We were promised by AA staff that when we got to Miami our onward flights would be rebooked and that there would be buses to take us to a Miami hotel for the night with transfers back to the airport. The flight to Miami was appalling no hot food surly crew. I was given two bags of nuts as a ""comp."" When we finally arrived at Miami the ground staff were useless one particular individual putting on the best display of passive aggression towards customers that I have ever seen. We were left to fend for ourselves. I got a taxi to a motel and paid my own way. Luckily the hotel had a free airport shuttle the next day.",1american-airlines,07/01/14,I was at the priority check-in line for flight 169 LAS to NRT scheduled departure 9.15am. I arrived 2 hours early I thought the priority line should be fast however I waited for 1 hour and was still waiting. From early morning there was only one 1st class counter opened the 2nd one was opened at 8.15am. The line was very long slow and chaotic. One agent tried to organize it so that the passengers waiting would not obstruct the walkway she had to repeat the same message again and again to every passenger that joined the queue. What a waste of man power and inefficiency.,2american-airlines,07/01/14,CDG to JFK. Flight bought at the last minute at a very reasonable price. Of course you get what you pay for. The plane (B767) looks good from the outside (new painting). Inside it's so old that I can't even remember the last time I've been in such an outdated plane. The overhead compartments were so small that even my bag pack could not fit in. No need to talk about inflight entertainment as there's barely any. It's just a few central screens with two movies played. The funniest is that business class seats apparently don't have inflight entertainment either as before we landed the crew mentioned that they would be collecting portable devices in business class. The seat was of course quite worn out and not that comfortable. At least the food was not that bad. I expected much worse after boarding the plane. Maybe it's because it was made in CDG but the pasta I ordered were tasty (even though the portion could have been bigger). What struck me was how non existent the flight attendants were during the flight. They showed up to bring the main meal and the snack before arrival in JFK and that's about it. AA had reserved the last three seats of the plane for them. Two of the FA's spent the flight on those seats while the third one remained hidden behind the curtain in the galley. You didn't feel welcome to ask for refreshments during the flight. Anyway all in all American clearly offers a substandard product. The worst product I've seen I think is that of US Airways. I can't imagine what the merger of the two will produce.,2american-airlines,07/01/14,DCA-LAX-DCA. 737-800. Outbound: Flight on time. Pre-ordered steak dinner was quite good. Staff efficient and reasonably friendly. Drinks service OK for flight length with a mini pre-packed snack basket (sweets chips nuts etc.) served closer to landing. Seat and entertainment system simply awful for so-called First Class with no foot rest or individual video screens. Only a video via the ceiling mounted screens and cheap earplug type headsets given free. This seat is not comfortable for a 5.5 hour flight. I hope the new seats that are advertised work better when these planes are retrofitted in the future. Inbound: Had access to the AA LAX Flagship Lounge (inside Admiral's Club) due to my OneWorld Emerald (BA Gold) status. Almost empty in the early morning with a reasonable spread of food and drinks. Flight on time. Staff more friendly than the outbound flight. Pre-ordered omelette breakfast quite good. This aircraft had the new sky interior but the same awful seats and entertainment. Looking forward to trying out new AA domestic seat and video products in the near future. Bags delivered slower than expected at DCA.,6american-airlines,07/01/14,LHR - DLW - Reno. Major complaint is seat allocation. Booked flight for 6 including 2 children under 7 6 months ago. Online checks appeared to show a group of 6 seats allocated together. At check in for return flight we were told that no allocation had been made and that only 3 groups of 2 seats were available. I thought that seating for family groups were a prime consideration. How naive of me. Other airlines such as Virgin can manage this simple task! DFW to Reno leg used an old Mcdonnell Douglas 80. In each direction the family were placed right at the rear where the engine noise was fearsome throughout the trip. Incidentally why not load the rear first to avoid the constant queuing to get on board and luggage stowed when loaded from the front?,3american-airlines,07/01/14,"I was booked from JFK to GRU on AA 951 on Jan 3 2014. American Airlines cancelled the flight without explanation and provided no alternatives. I scrambled to find a replacement flight on my own and got a seat on AA 919 from JFK to GRU the next day Jan 4 2013. I checked in more than 3 hours prior to the flight and went to the gate where staff were simply milling about. No boarding announcements until one of the American Airlines staff said that ""The plane (which had arrived a day earlier) was at the hanger"" when it should have been at the gate. Time of departure was pushed back 30 minutes then another 30 minutes then another 30 minutes and so on until it was 3 hrs late! As a result we could not go anywhere but had to stick around in case the flight suddenly started to board. When it was time to board the famous rudeness of American Airlines staff reared its head. The gate staff started barking at passengers about boarding the aircraft efficiently. The head of the cabin crew made a similarly rude announcement that passengers should take their seats quickly. The only saving grace was I finally asked for an upgrade and got one. Still even in a higher cabin the service was poor by notoriously grumpy flight attendants. We landed several hours late in GRU and had to wait a long time for ground staff to bring the moving bridge to the plane! The only reason I stay with American Airlines is for the frequent flier miles.",1american-airlines,03/01/14,RDU-LHR return in Y. Outbound check-in and bag check handled smoothly no complaints. Boarding somewhat chaotic but this was mainly due to the layout of the gate area. Aircraft on this route are older 763s with no IFE but seats and toilets seemed in decent condition. Food decent enough and FAs - while not terribly friendly - were diligent about offering drinks. Entertainment was pretty miserable but what do you expect when you have no seatback system and have to rely on the overheads? Pretty laughable for an international leg. Return flight check- in at LHR was a breeze but boarding was infuriating! Pax with group 3/4 boarding passes rushing the gate during pre-boarding gate attendants barely speaking above a whisper when announcing boarding groups. Really ridiculous. FAs on return flight much friendlier. Main Cabin Extra proved worthwhile as the legroom was plentiful. All in all worth the competitive fare but not nearly at the standard of other nations' flag carriers.,7american-airlines,03/01/14,LHR-DFW-SJO return via JFK. I set out with middling expectations of AA in economy and was pleasantly surprised. New 777 is great seats a little narrow but what can you expect? Flights to and from SJO on old 757s but crew made both flights quite enjoyable. If only JKF immigration would work a little better. Everyone's experiences are always different but on this occasion AA looked after us nicely.,8american-airlines,03/01/14,Recently landed from DFW-LAX-SFO. On my initial flight from DFW to SFO most things in comparison were fine however the quality of first class compared to Virgin is excessively disappointing. There were a lot more passengers in the first class then ever the FA was running around endlessly and even forgot to give us a cookie or even a snack with our drink. On the return trip the service was much better but did not offer any pre-flight beverages. On the last leg they even failed to grab my coat and hang it up for us. Overall Virgin America still has true First Class seats the new AA first class are more like business class with amenities. The food is quote mediocre but better then before.,5american-airlines,03/01/14,AA hits a homerun with its new business class on the 777-300. They've entirely reinvented the AA business class experience with lie-flat seats in private pods. From JFK-LHR we experienced great food good service and restful sleep. It beats the business class of many quality European and Asian airlines - and is the best among US airlines. Nice to see AA investing in its product.,10american-airlines,02/01/14,Wanted to fly from ORD to CLE and decided to take AA for the first time after having had bad experiences with them a few years ago. Flight was canceled 1 min before departure without any information and now have been waiting for 7 hours to get my bag returned. The ground staff are rude and unhelpful if this is suppose to be the new American as they advertise it then I think they should over think their business model.,1american-airlines,31/12/13,I have read many negative reviews about American Airlines and was hesitant about booking my recent flight on them but due to the price of the ticket (flew first class) and the short notice of booking a flight over the holidays I chose them. Well I was very pleasantly surprised. All my flights (GNV-MIA-IAD) were on time. The flight attendants were friendly and very professional. The meals were good and the airplanes were modern and clean. I usually fly Delta but with such a pleasant experience on American I may reconsider who I book on future flights.,10american-airlines,30/12/13,As noted in previous posts the American Airlines of today is in the midst of a steady decline. The AA of the 70's and 80's is now just a distant memory. This week I had my 17 year old on a flight from from ORF to DFW then to SGF. Easy connection and my son knows DFW very well and can get around pretty easily. While tracking the flight it was diverted to Charlotte. Reason was weather in DFW. Delay after delay now became a mechanical issue. So arrive DFW 2 hrs late. Needless to say he missed the connection and with Christmas there are no other seats the rest of the day until 9am the following morning. If I had not acted quickly and did some pleading with AA I was able to get him to XNA 7 hours late. So all in all AA is just nothing but a band of misfits and poor maintained aircraft. My son made it to XNA where a relative picked him up and delivered to SGF 2 hours away. Picked up bag next morning in SGF.,2american-airlines,30/12/13,Cayman Islands to Las Vegas in December. Overall a good experience Flights on time and connection in Miami was quick. Service and food were both good. Individual entertainment at the seats will be a huge improvement over the clunky TV hanging from the cabin ceiling.,8american-airlines,30/12/13,AA1319 IND-LAX I'm an Executive Platinum with AA and they do treat me well. Flew out of IND on 12/26 on their fairly new non-stop to LAX in a Sky 737-800. Flight was packed. I was travelling with a small dog a Christmas gift for my in-laws. The crew was great and the FC Senior FA was especially pleasant. AA's FC seating is very comfortable for Domestic flights and the seat recline version is a favorite of mine. I had pre-selected my dinner choice on line it was provided hot and tasty. Was hoping for a sundae but freshly baked cookies were served. If they can transfer their outstanding level of customer to US Air they are going to have a mighty wonderful Domestic US carrier.,10american-airlines,29/12/13,ORD-LAS Return. My wife and I recently made this trip with some friends. The flight out to LAS was on an old livery S80. I was in seat 30D which meant the engines were right next to me and it was some extremely noisy 4 hours. The MD80 economy seat is not the most comfortable. ORD was under considerable snow that day and the de- icing truck broke down in front of our aircraft which delayed us going out. It was an extremely turbulent flight but the flight deck kept us in the loop the whole time. Flight back to ORD was on an old livery B738. Pushback was a few minutes ahead of schedule and overall a smooth flight until we got to ORD which was under snow again. This time we had a decent enough movie to watch and once again the flight deck was extremely interactive. Standard flight in terms of food and beverage. The FAs were smiling very welcoming warm and overall did a great job in taking care of the passengers.,8american-airlines,29/12/13,It is almost laughable that AA is a part of Oneworld when the service standards of AA are not even close to its alliance partners. I flew LAX-NRT yesterday - disinterested and poorly-dressed cabin crew small and uninspired meals and an entertainment system that could have been considered to be state of the art in 1990. Each time the fasten seat belt was on there were no safety announcements and passengers and crew wandering around the aircraft during turbulence. It was such a pleasure to board a Qantas aircraft for the remainder of my journey.,1american-airlines,23/12/13,"This airline continues to live up to their reputation that they have earned for being terrible. I arrived at my connecting flight 10 minutes early only to be greeting by the agent who says ""we gave your seat away because you were late"" then proceeds to close the door. I was 10 minutes before departure time! I am a Platinum customer! American knew I was coming. Being a customer much less one with status means nothing to American.",1american-airlines,23/12/13,Had reservations for San Francisco - Miami and later on Miami - New York La Guardia on my 3 weeks USA tour. The SFO-MIA flight started badly where all passengers were standing in a long line 5am in the morning with no open check in counters and self-check in unresponsive. Some passengers overheard AA staff state that the flight will be delayed however I saw that all was according to plan on all screens. Ground staff finally came and they denied any delays. Self check in either couldn't read the passport scans or simply loading into oblivion with an error message at the end. AA staff was more concerned only with payment for checked in baggage which for a non US passenger is considered unacceptable. Check in was chaotic to say the least and the First class counter looked even less organized. Only after everyone was checked in the flight jumped from 7am to 8am and in an hour the flight was delayed to 5.30pm! No explanation or apology. Only 1 agent handled the full flight rerouting people with onwards destinations but no interest in assisting any of the passengers who have Miami as their final stop. No apologies no assistance no accommodation no food for a 10 hours delay! The afternoon flight was boarded on time on an ancient B757 that seemed to still have technical problems as we learned from the crew. We stayed on the tarmac for another 90 minutes. Plane old and showing its age with interior from the 80s and an inaudible flickering screen leg room acceptable. Crew incredibly chatty amongst each other. Non visible cabin presence. Flight from Miami to New York as well an ageing 737-800. As they again charge for checked in bags all bring oversized bags onboard causing a less than civilized situation where there is NO space for all the bags thus delays in checking those bags and taking them out of the cabin. Again no food onboard for a long flight. Will never consider this airline.,1american-airlines,21/12/13,Will never fly with this airline again just dreadful. Manchester to JFK and back just one film each way overhead TVs in the aisles not seatback. Poor food terrible tea coffee not much better staff looked worn out and as if they wished they could be anywhere apart from working on those planes. Delayed 2 hours on the way back. Two hours sitting on the plane is no fun. Obviously no contingency plan there then! Next time I'll just fly to Heathrow and fly with Virgin.,1american-airlines,21/12/13,I have flown SFO-MIA-Ecuador and back 6 times the past 2 years. Although the staff can seem a little long in the tooth and sometimes just mean I do appreciate the pilots. They seem to be a cut above the rest of the industry with those 757's.,7american-airlines,19/12/13,Having just flown American Airlines for the first time from JFK to London Heathrow I can honestly say AA are a contender for the worlds worst airline. From the state of the plane to the poor quality of the food to a laughable 1970's entertainment system all compounded by a disinterested flight crew. As a regular intercontinental traveller used to flying airlines such as Emirates Singapore Qatar etc I was truly shocked by how bad AA really are. What made it funny was reading the CEO's editorial in the inflight magazine his goal of being the worlds best carrier is a long way off.,1american-airlines,17/12/13,My trip from Toronto to Bogota has not happened yet as the connecting flight from Toronto to Dallas was delayed due to mechanical problems based on what we were told and they did not allow us to board the flight. The AA reps had us wait in front of different counters for more than 5 hours without resolving anything to more than 20 people. In addition they had to handle the receiving flights. The staff was rude and not friendly at all. I gave up and agreed to have my trip delayed by one day losing one entire day in my vacation plans. I hope today it will be different. I will never use this company for my business trips.,1american-airlines,17/12/13,LHR-LAX-LAS-LAX-OGG-LAX-LHR Nov 28 to Dec 9. I had a 2-week trip to 3 destinations in America all on American Airlines. All 6 flights were punctual and flight attendants on all flights were polite and friendly especially the last 3 flights. The new business class seat in AA's 777-300ER is the most comfortable I've had. Slept very well on both flights between LHR and LAX. I was also satisfied with the unexpected angled flat bed business class seat on LAX-OGG-LAX flights in 767-300. Overall I was very happy with their service and products. If AA ground staff can also deliver the same good services then AA will become a true premium full service airline in America.,10american-airlines,17/12/13,My family and I traveled on AA from CDG (767-300) DFW (MD80) Sat 14 Dec and was completely satisfied. AA excel in two areas: 1) The super friendly hospitality of their Cabin Crew and 2) They provide meals that will fill you - their pizza prior to landing is sumptuous and most memorable. Their aircrafts are old and their IFE very ancient. So if price is a factor (especially when traveling with family) they will deliver satisfaction. The game changer is when their fleet is replaced with the latest in IFE offerings!,7american-airlines,16/12/13,To start with my departing flight to Dallas was canceled due to bad weather. The AA rep couldn't have been less helpful. In addition when she re-routed me the new flights had no first class seats. Therefore I expected a refund to fly coach. They refused because I supposedly got a special rate which was still more than double of the coach rate and I was not eligible for a refund. On my flight home the first class section had no TV or movie and had nowhere to plug in my headphones to listen to music. My best advice is to fly United.,4american-airlines,16/12/13,JFK (New York) to LAX (Los Angeles). We got at the airport went straight through security which was extremely easy then sat at the gate for a while. No delays. We were in seating group 2 which was extremely convenient. We got 2 seats next to each other. They let us use all electronic devices. The only in-flight entertainment was 12 radio stations and a couple of magazines but it was a great steady flight. The food was fine. They provided a breakfast sandwich with ham and cheese on a croissant. The staff were friendly and it was one of the best flying experiences I've had.,9american-airlines,16/12/13,Recently flew with American to and from Key West FL. It seems overly obvious that this 'old' airline is staffed with employees who are looking forward to retiring. Late flights unusual delays on the tarmac fake smiles and just the feeling of being on a cattle car. The days of friendly flight attendants is but a fond memory.,1american-airlines,14/12/13,AA 922 from La Paz (LPB) via Santa Cruz (VVI) to Miami. This flight is constantly delayed or even cancelled. Most of the time due to technical problems which means that airline politics put cost control above performance and well above customer satisfaction. Always try to find a LAN flight before travelling with AA.,1american-airlines,12/12/13,Thursday evening they cancelled my son's flight to DFW (due to weather) I held on the phone for 1.5 hours and even though he was flying as an unaccompanied minor and they could see I was on another flight to a foreign country at the time they wanted me to pick him up and take him back to the airport later. My friends husband came to the airport to take my son so he could then take him to his new 2pm flight. I waited in line at the airport I was flying out from for a gate agent to fill out the paperwork pay the extra fee etc. but no one was even at work at the gate. I have to fill out paperwork for my son pay and still get to my own flight and through security. My son was put on a flight for that afternoon then makes it to Dallas. Today I come back to the country and when attempting to board my flight from MIA to DFW I am told I can't take my bag on that has already been on 4 American Flights since Friday. They called final boarding. She proceeded to tell me now I wouldn't be getting on that flight. The supervisor eventually put me on a standby flight for 6.50 am since I missed the 8.35 pm flight I was supposed to be on the night before. They told me I was welcome to sleep in the terminal. At this point I don't know if I'll get on the flight in the morning since I'm standby and they wouldn't assure me a seat.,1american-airlines,11/12/13,Flew ORD-MIA last week onboard AA1252. First remark: I got a reward ticket using my AAdvantage points and I must say that contrary to what happens with many other carriers a free ticket with AA is really a free ticket as I paid only 2USD for taxes and that's something I really appreciate. Flying AA is a very basic experience though: plane was a B767-300 freshly re-painted but about 20 years old even if the seat comfort is okay for a 3hour flight. No entertainment just scattered small screens and no meal provided for free just drinks. Having to pay USD 25 for checking your bag is something I really do not understand but it is a general policy of US carriers. Crew professional and quite friendly and a very talkative captain. Left and arrived on time with no mechanical problems happened as in the 50% of the AA flights I had flown in the past (total-10) so no complaints at all this time and I will consider to fly with them again for domestic flights in the future.,6american-airlines,10/12/13,"I am appalled by AA's ticket and baggage agents! Today my 76 year old Grandmother flew on an international flight from JFK to POS through MIA and from check-in to arrival was treated extremely poorly. This is a trip we have given her every year for the past 10+ years. But from check-in at JFK - the AA agents were rude and gave the impression as if we weren't worth the time. The trip began at 3am since her flight was scheduled to depart at 5.40am - I personally booked her round trip ticket and re-confirmed the requests for wheelchair service an aisle seat and extra legroom days in advance. None of these requests were listed on her reservation and when we asked the agent if she could try to accommodate in any way we were give very abrupt and snide no's. The wheelchair took 20 minutes to come. Baggage clerks - instead of checking her bags and placing them on the conveyor we were told that she had to carry them to the gate and place them on the conveyor herself as ""they aren't paid to do so"". Her transfer in MIA was exactly the same - no wheelchair assistance listed on the system and in order to make her connecting flight my Grandma had to walk a distance - from her arrival gate to the departure gate. Never again.",3american-airlines,09/12/13,Chicago - Toronto - Miami - Las Vegas - Chicago Every flight we took left on time. All flights were full except for the Vegas -Chicago flight which was mostly empty making for a great flight. The service was as expected and the planes were all in good condition some were in fact very new. The in flight magazine is particularly good on this airline. I was very concerned about selecting this airline as there are so many bad reviews about delays but honestly I can say we had a wonderful experience flying with them.,9american-airlines,09/12/13,ORD_DUS-FLR on AA/Air Berlin - 11/27 DUS-ORD on 12/8. Biz class full in both directions - I hope that continues as flying through DUS is a breeze compared to connecting at Heathrow. ORD-DUS 767-300 - the flight attendant was the only let-down: she was friendly but wasn't too attentive and talked with other passengers about how she didn't like flying long haul and was at her tolerance limit after a 7-hour flight. If you don't like long-haul then don't work it - ridiculous. Food was good - I pre-ordered it online and that worked well. Purser was very friendly. Arrived 45 min ahead of schedule and did the easy connection to Air Berlin Q-400 to Florence. Nice flight and on-time. DUS-ORD 767-300. Great flight attendant - friendly and attentive without being too in-your- face. Good food pre-ordered again online. Samsung Tablet is nice but again they don't put enough TV shows on it - you get one episode from the 1st season of a series. Overall I hope with the merger things keep getting better with FA attitudes. Good flights in general.,8american-airlines,09/12/13,Flew from Seattle on December 3rd. Arriving to Chicago we have found that our flight AA4250 to Hartford has been canceled. The AA representative has claimed that it is because of weather which was impossible to believe as practically all the flights to New England had been on time. We realized lately that they canceled it due to small amount of passengers. This is how American makes its money: they lure people with low price and convenient time and then cancel the flight when there is not enough passengers shifting the cost of the night stay transportation and the rest to the customers. Shameful practice. Ultimately unreliable.,1american-airlines,07/12/13,Traveled one-way moving back home from Miami to Rio. They use the same ancient Boeing 767-300 that I used to fly 20 years ago on this route. There is still no individual screens in economy. Dinner was acceptable and the flight attendant even offered a repeat entree-without my asking! Breakfast before landing was a small albeit a hot croissant with coffee and orange juice. Although we departed on-time the arrival in Rio was late by almost 30 minutes-with no explanation from the crew. All in all AA is not a bad airline: I just believe it has defined itself as a mediocre carrier. If it's cheap I'd fly it again.,5american-airlines,06/12/13,I would never have booked a flight with American Airlines had I known what a pain they are and how much they lack in customer service. I ended up taking the loss and canceling my flight to book with United Airlines. They don't have ridiculous change fees (200$ - more than my ticket cost) and they have people who actually care to help you and listen to what you say on the phone. American Airlines needs a serious makeover and judging from the hundreds of reviews previously posted saying similar things and not recommending the airline as well I am not the only one who thinks this.,1american-airlines,05/12/13,"Had to cancel my trip because of American's multiple delays. They called awakening me at 3am advising my flight was delayed until 12pm from its original time of 7.15 am. I arrived at the airport to self check in for my boarding pass because I couldn't print online due to the change. There was one person servicing people for ""self- check in"" in one line. So if people needed to check bags they were in the same line as those who did not need to check bags and only needed to get to the kiosk to obtain the boarding pass. An American employee should have been there to redirect people who needed only boarding passes and have separate lines. I stood in line for 30 minutes to get to the kiosk and obtain my boarding pass with no bags to check. Service attendant appeared incompetent to other customers ahead of me. The service was very slow with no pleasant smiling faces. Further I learned when I got to the gate that Flight 1202 again delayed another hour for 1 pm. Then I receive a voicemail that the flight again delayed until 5 pm and that I would arrive in Dallas 10.10 pm not to arrive in CT until Thursday at 12 noon. That was also not guaranteed. I needed to be in Hartford CT by 8 am. Hence why I scheduled the flight for early morning departure the day before. While I received a refund I didn't make my conference. They offered no alternatives to get me to CT in time on Wednesday. They only offered me an overnight stay at DFW airport red eye at 1.25 am with no sleep for arrival at my conference at 12 noon more than 4 hours late for the conference. Every time I deal with American there is always something. I will not fly American again.",1american-airlines,04/12/13,Flight that we were boarding in Denver arrived late we only had 53 minutes of layover time before our next flight in Phoenix. The flight attendants at the gates were informed we 4 along with 16 other passengers were going to miss our connecting flight due to the late arrival. 16 people. When we arrived in Phoenix to my surprise our connecting flight departed on-time we arrived 20 minutes late. 16 people late due to a late plane arrival/departure nothing any one of us passengers could have prevented. Naturally we proceeded to the customer service desk. I received a 100$ voucher for a flight costing more than 500$ no food or drink? 16 of us disgruntled passengers slept in the airport. I will never fly them again.,1american-airlines,02/12/13,I flew to New York City last Monday and I sat in the front row of coach. I got a lot of legroom and felt like I was in first class. The staff were nice on this 738. The plane was delayed 1 hour due to a winter storm. The entertainment did not work so I used my tablet. I got to have a nice breakfast with dessert and I got free baggage because of the Advantage card from AA.,7comair,22/07/15,"I recently took four Comair (British Airways) flights in Zimbabwe and South Africa. While the aircraft appeared a little tired, I was impressed with the business class cabin service, catering was good for the series of short flights undertaken and seemed on a par with short-haul Qantas 737-800 international service. If requesting a seat during the booking process, I recommend selecting 1 D E or F. While there are three seats on this side of the aircraft rarely is the middle seat used. These seats are exit row and can, depending on the aircraft configuration, have up to almost a metre of legroom. All Business seats behind row 1 appear only to have legroom akin to economy class (which begs the question why pay so much extra for no more legroom). I fly business class regularly and would happily fly Comair again when next in Africa, and BA when travelling in Europe.",7comair,14/07/15,"This airline flies under the banner of British Airways. I thought the planes looked old and tired. The customer service onboard was OK, although slighly abrupt. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes. My flight with the same airline to Durban a few days earlier was also delayed for about an hour. When I asked for a customer service feedback form, they seemed shocked that I should want to offer feedback. Needless to say there was no way to leave feedback with the airline. I won't be flying with them again. Luckily there is now quite a bit of choice in South Africa.",2comair,11/06/15,"My flight Durban to Jo'burg on 10 May under the BA banner was supposed to connect with QR to Doha and then Singapore but left a little late. Although my baggage was booked right through to Singapore, I was refused check-in by QR at Jo'burg because it was said to be too late even though it was an hour before departure time. Whilst QR rescheduled flights to Singapore at no extra charge' (I should hope so)! I lost considerable time and money (had to pay for a replacement flight to Jakarta that I missed because of Comair's delay), neither QR nor Comair accepted any sort of responsibility or liability for this uncoordinated chaos. Then my luggage took over two hours to find at Jo'burg Airport. Definitely an airline to avoid.",1comair,28/04/15,I flew from Jo'burg to Cape Town flight 6427 on 23rd April 2014 at 16h00. My travel agent due to being diabetic always books me an aisle seat so I can get up and move for circulation. I also recently had a hand operation and this aisle seat helped me to keep my hand away from other passengers. I checked in and got the seat my agent booked. As I boarded I was told I was moved to a middle seat. When I queried this I was greeted with a bad attitude and was told they needed my seat for a disabled person. When I explained my medical condition and my operation I was told I could wait for another flight if I did not want to take the middle seat. When I got on the plane the person in my seat was not even disabled. When I approached the stewards my complaints was brushed aside. Poor attitude by staff.,1comair,19/01/15,Johannesburg to Cape Town Business class. Aircraft non operational so 2 hour delay whilst replacement aircraft prepared. Aircraft old and poor condition of seat and toilets. Speaking to ground staff its apparent that delays are frequent due to mechanical issues with old aircraft. Return flight also delayed by 1 hour. According to pilot the aircraft in JNB also non operational and requiring replacement. As before old aircraft tatty condition. Poor reliability.,2comair,01/10/14,Flew from Jo'burg to Victoria Falls in Zim. BA check in was very smooth and efficient. Turns out the BA lounge is not open during the day and we were directed to a third party lounge which was very nice indeed (better that the Galleries lounge that BA operate). We had to take a bus to get to our plane which was fine and efficiently done. The plane was an old BA badged 737-400 I suspect a reject from European operations. But plane was clean and well presented. We were given a choice of hot meals which I have to say was very tasty and well presented on the outbound leg. The inbound was not quite as nice but still acceptable. Both flights were packed to rafters with not a seat spare but staff coped very well. It would be good to see Comair get some new planes as the old cast offs from BA are really showing their age now.,8comair,28/08/14,BA 6275 1 August 2014 JNB-Windhoek. BA 6274 15 August 2014 Windhoek-JNB. We recently flew Comair franchise flights between Johannesburg and Windhoek the livery was BA excellent service clean and comfortable 737 on schedule hot meal served with choice of wines.,9comair,26/05/14,JNB to PLZ. Very good service on this lunch-time flight. Stewardess handled the issue of removing an under-age passenger from the exit row behind us with perfect tact. Tasty hot meal served efficiently (in contrast to SAA which is just a sandwich) and very fast baggage delivery.,9comair,29/03/14,My husband is blind and we therefore request special assistance on all flights. Flying from Durban to Johannesburg March 26th 2014 and checking in early we were allocated seats in row 21. I asked for seats nearer the front of the aircraft but was told that assisted passengers are always seated near the rear. The 3 assisted passengers on our flight were not embarked until about 20 minutes before departure and once onboard had to struggle through a nearly full aircraft to their seats. The stewardess on duty in that area was as unhelpful as she could be. We fly long haul regularly. BA always embarks assisted passengers first allowing them space to settle down before the crowd arrives. The stewardess in our cabin on our later flight to LHR couldn't have been more helpful. Why does Comair make life even more difficult for the disadvantaged?,5comair,01/09/13,Another trip from Johannesburg to Harare- 737s both ways and all on time. Crew were good kept us informed particularly on return flight when there were very strong winds and mine dump dust at Jo'burg. Outward meal was a hot meal return meal was the whole grain roll-this seems to be standard. No complaints at all and plenty of leg room in these old planes.,8comair,19/05/13,Johannesburg to Harare return. Outward flight on time - rather old 737-but clean. Cabin crew efficient lunch time flight so we were offered chicken or alternative lunch which was acceptable. Return flight left Harare on time 737 again and a light snack with drinks. Again cabin crew efficient and information from the flight deck along the route. Arrived on time-good experience overall.,8comair,28/04/13,"DUR-CPT BA6310 2 April. As late morning flight arriving lunchtime I expected a bit of a meal. What I was offered was either a chicken roll or salad roll. I chose the salad roll - multi-grain smothered in margarine with 2 slices of cucumber! That's it! That's Comair's ""salad"" roll? Even QF do better on their bad domestic days! Why did SAA give up on that route?",4comair,17/04/13,Economy class JNB-CPT and CPT-JNB. Take off and landing in time. Baggage arrived to carousel even before passengers. Inflight staff very friendly and helpful. Meals are good also for 2 hr flight only (we had a complete lunch/dinner warm meal).,10comair,19/03/13,Flew PLZ-JNB as part of a BA ticket to LHR. Simply put check in was a nightmare. A bag of 25kg that had travelled with us from LHR at the same weight was rejected as overweight even though the original baggage tag (with weight clearly marked) was still attached. We spent 30 minutes at Club check in unpacking and re- packing our bags on the dirty airport floor with all our possessions spread out. Highly embarrassing until I turned around to see someone at every other counter doing the same. The manager explained that as a franchise of BA - a fact not made clear during booking nor even at the airport - BA insisted they adhere to strict baggage limits for international flights even when they could see that we were executive Gold and Bronze and had flown over with bags the same weight. For this I blame BA but the local staff could have tried to appear less pedantic and could also have found someone with a far more pleasant demeanour for the Club desk. I booked with BA for the service but on this leg was sorely disappointed.,3comair,20/03/12,Recently flew British Airways from Johannesburg to Cape Town. Found the plane to be very dirty and the service mediocre. Most disappointing was when the flight attendant handed me an envelope with a generic note stating that the special child meal I had requested was unavailable.,1comair,22/11/11,JNB-PLZ-JNB. Offers consistently good service on this route. Pleasant and attentive cabin crew decent food for a shortish commuter flight and an excellent lounge in JNB for BA Exec card members.,8comair,25/08/11,Windhoek-Johannesburg on a Boeing 737-300 with British Airways flag operated by Comair. Very good service and ample legroom. Aircraft clean and departure before scheduled time. A very good flight and pleasant experience.,8comair,30/06/11,I fly to and from NYC each week. I was doing PIT-LGA legs but the cost of the PIT-EWR flights (Continental Express operated by Comair) were significantly cheaper over the past few months. I now understand why. The 6:00PM Thurs evening flights have been cancelled for the past 4 of 5 weeks (with the 5th being delayed 2 hrs). I understand how weather and ATC can affect things but seems to be an operational issue. 4 cancellations in 5 weeks is unacceptable. I will obviously go back to the LGA-PIT legs on US Air.,comair,26/02/11,Johannesburg - Port Elizabeth - Johannesburg. Outbound Friendly check-in. Superb SLOW lounge at JNB with excellent buffet breakfast. No priority boarding. Rather old 737-300 with tatty interior. Economy-type seating. FAs attentive. Breakfast served at 11.45 am and rejected after two previous breakfasts (one on Virgin flight the other in lounge). Plane seemed to have a pressurisation problem so a rather painful descent. Inbound Speedy check-in and through passport control in 5 minutes. Reasonable Premiere lounge. Old 737-400 with ashtray in toilet. Attentive FAs and better than usual lunch. Baggage handling quick. Overall good flights and better than Club Europe.,7comair,04/08/10,Cape Town-Johannesburg. The service was extremely attentive and catering outstanding. The cabin and seating of BA Comair aircraft mean they fall short of the likes of SAA. B737-300 was worn inside - rather dingy and dirty looking and the Business Class cabin was the same as the economy cabin save empty B and E seats. This resulted in a rather uncomfortable journey. I don't think I'll choose another Comair flight in Business Class until their fleet is renewed and material product offering improved.,7continental-airlines,07/06/12,Mumbai to Newark on Business first. Worst service with FA's full of attitude. Mid flight snacks very poor and just kept in the galley. No service as I saw most of the passengers to go up to the galley asking for water and tea. It was like a self service. Not a service you expect in business class.,2comair,22/04/10,Johannesburg to Cape Town on an early departure (0605). The seats are comfortable and Breakfast was tasty. The crew were professional and friendly. Arrived on time and no problems experienced.,8continental-airlines,30/05/12,Flew from Manchester UK to Newark USA with continental (now owned by United). Staff seemed a bit miserable but they did their job well and were very attentive. The inflight entertainment system was excellent and full of entertainment and the meals were what you would expect from economy class. All the flights were on time and went without any issues. overall I am happy with my experience on Continental Airlines.,7continental-airlines,16/05/12,Travelled from Glasgow to Newark return. Excellent service both ways with good food and ample drinks provided. Paid extra for extra legroom so seated in emergency doors. A good choice. Lots of room. The return flight had very courteous and helpful staff. They displayed lots of humour and are an asset to the company. Inflight entertainment was excellent easy to use and free. Will definitely fly with them again.,9continental-airlines,07/05/12,My partner had booked 4 flights to USA and within the US over 3 weeks. We flew from Heathrow to Washington to Las Vegas to Newark to Heathrow. Overall we were happy with the service provided. Checking in was quick and easy no long queues and staff helpful. Flights were on time and their system of grading boarders was good. Leg room was ample on 3 of 4 flights. We had onboard entertainment with latest films not charged extra and no technical hitches. Food given on 2 of the flights only - usual standard airline food - hot and edible. Downside was that onboard staff were unfriendly and only did the bare minimum. Some of the planes were dated. I would use this airline again but feel they need to address their cabin crews attitude as they are at the forefront of this business and people like to be greeted by friendly faces.,7continental-airlines,11/04/12,Travelled 4 legs inside and to/from US with Continental. As a family of 5 with 3 children we never got our reserved seats we where put in 5 different locations on the plane on all 4 legs. When we asked to sit with our children we were met with rude personnel. Booking tickets several months in advance and checking in many hours in advance made no difference. When a delay from US to Europe made us miss the connecting flight no one would help us.,1continental-airlines,30/03/12,"TXL-EWR-CLE-EWR-TXL. Had to board a full flight manually as systems had crashed I missed the connection in EWR. Onboard attentive FA's nice food and IFE. In EWR they only managed to get me an Economy seat despite the First/Business tickets only to find at the gate they were happily upgrading frequent flyers. On return flight on one seat the IFE was broken the next the lap table didn't work so I ended up in the first row ""happily"" being kept awake by chatting FA's. Food was good they just forgot to get me dessert. Luggage arrived late and of course all the priority bags came in almost last. Both flights no flat beds just ones where you slide down.",4continental-airlines,06/03/12,Economy BFS-EWR-PTY return. BFS-EWR on 757-200 - did not bother with seatback entertainment. Crew pleasant food average but plenty of drinks rounds. Was travelling with my wife but we had been unable to get seats together. EWR-PTY - rep at gate sorted out two together. Flight to PTY (737-900) was unremarkable - the entertainment you pay for by swiping your CC. Return flight PTY-EWR: Cabin crew seemed uptight answering questions in a very unhelpful way. Request for 'trash' was like a command. EWR- BFS was marred by fact that my seat would not recline - however flight was just under 6 hours and middle seat was unoccupied. Overall a poor service with the only benefit that it was the easiest way to get to PTY from BFS.,4continental-airlines,05/03/12,LHR-EWR-MCO-IAD-LHR on 757/737s. Very pleased with attentive staff who were only too happy to help with any questions. Full flights all round with good food for economy. Better than BA or Virgin on similar routes staff are certainly more attentive and put customer service first. I have to say that CO/UA certainly are very reasonable for times and service of flights.,9continental-airlines,01/03/12,I am a disabled veteran and require a wheelchair. I don't think I have ever been ignored by anyone to this extent. I arrived in Edmonton was left sitting outside the aircraft until all passengers and crew were out. I finally wheeled myself up the three levels of ramps to customs. There was no personnel available to help me or my wife. This was on top of missing my connection on the way down.,2continental-airlines,28/02/12,Miami to Cleveland continuing to Syracuse NY. Plane was 15 minutes from SYR and returned to Cleveland. Eventual cancellation of SYR flight full plane. Sent to customer service line for 4 hour wait told no flights to Syracuse for 5 days. Would give us 1 night of hotel then we were on our own. Ended up having to spend $320 on car rental to drive to Syracuse. I was travelling with disabled husband and young daughter. Customer service (if you can call it that) was rude and nasty. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how I paid to fly then how it cost me an extra $320 to get home with a 7 hour drive. More than half the customers gave up on customer service line and left went directly to car rental.,3continental-airlines,24/02/12,My partner and I flew 4 flights in 1 week: London Heathrow-Houston-New Orleans and New Orleans-Newark- London Heathrow. 3 of the 4 flights were practically empty so legroom was made larger due to the extra seat. The entertainment on was good but we were asked to pay for the use of the TV on the flight to Newark with seemed a little bizarre. Overall the flights and food were great but awful staff attitude let them down. We didn't get one smile or pleasant exchange from the cabin crew on any of the flights. It doesn't cost anything to give someone a smile.,5continental-airlines,23/02/12,Managua Nicaragua to Houston. No leg room between seats. All exit aisle seats were empty as the airline now charges extra for them. Prohibited from moving to one. The video screens are right in front of your nose and are accidentally activated by resting your arm on the armrest. FA's are forced to hawk overpriced merchandise during the flight. There must be a more comfortable way to fly.,1continental-airlines,20/02/12,Flew round-trip LAX-Newark in the Business First section. Legroom was so small that when the seat in front of me was reclined fully I could not get out of my seat without holding on to his. The food was good but the experience certainly not worth the extra price over Economy. Continental messed up our reservations so we had to spend an hour with the airport agent to finally get 2 business seats not next to each other. Luckily other passengers were willing to switch so my husband and I could sit together.,2continental-airlines,16/02/12,Roundtrip Richmond to Vail Co. Reg jet from RIC to EWR was great. Excellent inflight service. EWR was awful. Gate agent was yelling at customers during boarding process. All EGE employees were great. They helped minimize the cost of luggage and assisted with every aspect of the process. Sat in first class on DIA to EWR leg and cabin crew could not have been more indifferent to the service. It was as if we were bothering them. On return flight skis were lost and did not arrive RIC. Overall very poor experience.,3continental-airlines,13/02/12,LHR-IAH-MSY. LHR-IAH brand new 777-200ER on time only half full had complete row to myself. Cabin staff friendly and attentive and when my ICE froze it was re-booted within minutes. Very easy journey. Food was bland and uninteresting. IAH-MSY busy flight on time with good service. Got the feeling that there is some rivalry between the United and Continental crews with the Continental folk wanting to do a bit more.,9continental-airlines,08/02/12,BOS-EWR-MSN. B737-700. Mid-morning flight Monday so mostly business flyers. Half-empty. 2 for every 3 seats closer to front. Full row to myself at the back. Decent sized seatback IFE. Flipped through the channels during the free preview and they have a good selection however $5.99 for 2hr or less or $7.99 2hr or more is steep. Landed Term C at EWR but need to hop on bus shuttle to Term A for regionals. Term A is awful; one way overpriced sit-down sandwich place coffee Jamba Juice and newsagent. EWR-MSN on ERJ-145 regional provider. Little overhead even with rollerboards ramp-checked.,7continental-airlines,06/02/12,BusinessFirst from Paris-Newark on a 757. The Star Alliance Lounge at CDG was nice enough. I feel the 757 is a small plane for that route. The Flat bed seating was nice but is was a little short for me since I am 6'3. Their AVOD is excellent and they had a great choice of movies. The food was very good and the flight attendants professional and attentive. The flight got in 30 minutes early. As a Star Alliance Gold Member I would choose United/Continental over Lufthansa because Lufthansa does not have flat bed Business Class Seating. For a US airline I feel Continental has a really good product and I hope that expands into the New United.,8continental-airlines,04/02/12,DFW-IAH-LHR return. Decent flight on small jet (operated by Colgan Air) to IAH. Got to board early with the United credit card which was great. IAH-LHR was on a new B-777 still in Continental livery. Clean and comfortable and no one next to me so I got two seats for the price of one! LHR-IAH was on a United B-777 and it was just as good. Only complaint was a lot of young children but another empty seat next to me. Food was pretty abysmal on the way back but it's a legacy American carrier so sort of expected. Basically 1.5 meals total each way. Overall what I expected for the price that I paid.,7continental-airlines,03/02/12,"Flew my family of five to Nigeria - Houston-Lagos. Flight attendant was very rude food was terrible. My 9 year old vomited onboard I turned the call light 3 times to get some assistance attendant repeatedly turn it off from her rest area. When she finally decided to make rounds I asked her why no one came she rudely replied "" I reset it because many people were calling"". After learning my son vomited she said she would come to us last which she did 1 hour later. On our flight from Lagos to Houston my son got up to go to restroom the male attendant serving water/juice blocking the aisle told my son he has to finish serving the passengers before my son could go. I will reconsider flying Continental in the near future.",1continental-airlines,01/02/12,LHR-EWR in 777 economy. Was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience as was expecting something a lot worse! Plane spotlessly clean and well maintained. Relatively low load so had 3 seats between 2 of us so a bit of extra room. Service was reasonable; crew performed what they had to do but not a lot more. Food ok and drinks priced as you would expect for alcohol. Inbound was pretty much the same; very low load so had whole row to myself. IFE was good. Food was good. Crew again performed what they had to do but American based crew really don't want to go out of their way unless they have to. Overall I was pleased with the flights and would consider them again for a trip to the US.,7continental-airlines,31/01/12,EWR to AMS in economy on B757. Value for money was good and on the flight from AMS the cabin crew was nice and polite. On this flight the cabin crew was less friendly and polite. My kids didn't get drinks and they forgot to give me part of the meal. Furthermore they let us wait onboard at the ramp in order to get in to AMS after 07.00 hours. The flight was already 20 minutes delayed. I am not happy with this type of aircraft on a long flight. We made the same trip in 09 and flew the B676 and also A330. That was much better. For the next flight I will certainly not use the B757. Perhaps United will change this.,7continental-airlines,30/01/12,Flight from Buffalo to Ft Lauderdale return was a complete nightmare. Tickets that had been ordered months ahead weren't on the system so it took an hour to check-in at Buffalo. Due to late takeoff we almost missed our connection in Newark. On the way back same story about overbooked flight only seats for 3 out of our party of 4. High stress for hours until the last minute when they found the 4th seat. Delay in Newark to Buffalo almost 7 hours with no explanation. Will never fly again on that airline.,4continental-airlines,28/01/12,Portland-Houston-Tegucigalpa returning two weeks later. Plane cabins were ragged FA's were rude on the flight to Tegucigalpa better on the way back. Refused to hold plane less than ten minutes so a group could clear security. (TSA and customs were the real culprits though). Food? That wasn't food!,4continental-airlines,26/01/12,ORD-FLL-ORD. I hold United's Premium Economy so when I made the reservation I was automatically given a seat choice in the front row of the economy section where the seats have extra leg room due to the bulkhead. On the down side there was no free audio. Instead there was Direct TV which included audio but for that I would have had to pay $7.99 for the three-hour trip.,5continental-airlines,24/01/12,My recent First class flight from EWR to SAT was an economy flight with wide seats. The food is bad cafeteria quality at best. The flight was delayed for equipment problems after we boarded. When we asked for a bag of nuts we were warned that we were using up our one bag quota per flight. Our return flight was delayed for 4 hours due to weather. We proceeded to enter the United Club and was told that it was only available to club members or international first class only As domestic first class travelers we could buy a one day pass for $50.00 per person. I guess it wasn't enough that we paid for a full fare first class ticket. Overall a very poor experience.,4continental-airlines,17/01/12,Flew Belfast to New York. Husbands seat wouldn't stay in upright position on return leg and male flight attendant wouldn't listen to him - kept telling him off for reclining his seat. FA rude during food service very abrupt and openly complained to her colleague when an elderly passenger didn't hear her abrupt offer of a drink. Also husband had to check-in his hand luggage as they ran out of room in the overhead lockers (mine had to go under my seat) because they don't stop people taking on multiple bags. Would have no complaints if flight attendants were less rude.,4continental-airlines,17/01/12,EWR-HNL. Flight delayed by 1 hr and 25 mins on departure due to late arrival of the aircraft from HNL and then a maintenance issue. Communication from both ground grew and captain was frequent. This flight was operated with a Micronesia division plane one of four in the fleet with the smaller BusinessFirst cabin. The 767-400 is a great airplane. Feels large and airy. This plane was in good shape. Cabin crew were pleasant efficient and helpful. Mostly an older crew as this is a senior route within the system. Sat in 10K. Great legroom but the reviews are true. It does get cold in the forward Economy cabin. Food for purchase only. Will be interesting to see if HA will steal some traffic from CO on this route when they start the JFK run in June 2012. Overall a good flight but pre-merger CO's on board product is looking dated and unspectacular.,8continental-airlines,13/01/12,GVA-EWR-BOS and BOS-EWR-GVA a week later. Old aircraft's old-fashioned entertainment (5 channels available only in two languages). Disgusting food. You have to pay for alcohol when all other non-American major airlines provide it for free. Lazy and unfriendly crew not willing to help at any time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I travel four times a year to the US and as far as I am concerned it's the last time with Continental.,3continental-airlines,05/01/12,"Cozumel to Houston - uneventful. Houston to Seattle - terrible. The temperature in the cabin was at least 90 degrees they did not announce any failure of the air conditioning it came on a few minutes prior to landing and cooled the plane slightly. Came through twice with beverage cart on a 4 hour flight. When leaving the plane I complained to a flight assistant that the temperature was too hot she responded with ""oh I know"". Baggage claim was announced to go to Carousel 14 and was eventually delivered to #9. Our bags were found standing in the middle of the floor on Carousel 9 and our 6th bag found on carousel 8.",3continental-airlines,02/01/12,San Diego to Houston. Overall I found both flight crews to be professional. Pilots took time to describe trip/weather conditions and flight attendants were nice. On the return leg of the trip there was a medical emergency on board and the crew handled it well. Check-in and boarding were easy. Seating was comfortable. Paying for checked baggage was a check against them but this is minor IMHO.,8continental-airlines,01/01/12,I will not use this service again. Cabin seats felt like they were broken on the 3 planes I flew on seats creaked and wobbled. Food was average as was the service. Had to reschedule my return flight due to family emergency. Instead of changing/adjusting the flight and cost I had to purchase a new ticket costing me another $1000 to return. I contacted customer service and have been ignored. In Houston the gates were changed but not updated on the boards had to sprint a half mile to catch my plane (E gates to C gates). Flying is bad enough I almost expect cattle prods the next time I fly.,3continental-airlines,23/12/11,SAN-IAH-LHR AMS-IAH-SAN return. Domestic segments on B737-900 transatlantic segments on B777-200ER to LHR and B767-400ER from AMS. Planes clean food above average service friendly and professional flights on time and my baggage arrived with me. Enjoyed DirectTV on domestic flights and audio-video on demand on international portions. Lie-flat seat in BusinessFirst very nice.,9continental-airlines,22/12/11,EWR-PBI return both on the 757. Everything went smoothly at EWR and Terminal C is the best terminal at the airport. The 757 had the New United Economy Plus seats with PTV's that has AVOD. Being 6'4 the Economy Plus seat was comfortable and is up there with Jet Blue's seat ( A very positive feature to the United merger). The AVOD was great with a long list of movies and I prefer it to the Direct TV option. The Crew on both legs were professional and attentive. I will fly Continental more often.,8continental-airlines,22/12/11,"LHR-IAH-LAX. The only real redeeming feature was the price. Inflight service was everything I expected. One flight attendant brushed off my attempt to hand him a used cup while his colleague nonchalantly kicked my bag into position beneath the seat in front of me for landing. That bag only there because there was no space left in the overhead bins - the result of lax enforcement of cabin bag size rules. Meals were half- decent even if presentation ought to be improved. Entertainment was almost monolingual and the range of audio programmes narrow. Most crucially late departure from LHR meant I missed my connection. The same thing happened with my United IAD-FRA-LHR trip in August. As the wording on the coffee cups suggests ""different name same values"". I've probably learnt my lesson and will stick to European airlines for my next journey.",3continental-airlines,21/12/11,LHR to IAH an enjoyable experience and I'll use again. Seat was comfortable but I made a mistake of giving up my aisle seat so a couple could sit together and found it hard to get past my neighbour from the window seat. Food and IFE were good with a choice of films and a system that was easy to use. Attendants were professional. Not quite the same for the onward internal CO connection (2 hours). Tired seats and cold meal only.,9continental-airlines,19/12/11,AMS-LAD-BOS. Smooth check-in at the airport because the flight was not fully booked they changed seats for us so we had the middle seat free. We flew the good old 757 seat was ok. Food nowadays on those intercontinental flights is below average. Crew were friendly and attentive. IE system average with enough movies to watch. We arrived 20 minutes early. On the leg to BOS everything went smoothly. We arrived a couple of minutes early and for the money paid I would do it again.,7continental-airlines,19/12/11,"PDX-ATL round trip. Very uncomfortable seats poor food offered flight attendants acted like they were doing passengers a favor. Had to wait forever to use to toilet. Since Continental merged with United they have sunk to an all time low. In the past they allowed upgrades for a reasonable fee - not anymore! They let premium seats go empty even when the plane was on its last segment and airborne the flight attendants would not let anyone sit in an area with more leg room. They said it was ""reserved"". I simply refused to upgrade to first class for $619 and they had empty seats there also. In the past before they merged with United I could upgrade for around $100 if seats were available. I simply don't understand the cost/benefit ratio of letting seats go empty instead of making them affordable or allowing someone to use coach class seats with more leg room once the aircraft is in flight. My ticket wasn't cheap to start with and the service I got was terrible from start to finish. This merger was not for the better!",1continental-airlines,16/12/11,Minneapolis-Chicago-Houston-Bogota. The booking appeared as United but in reality the flights Chicago- Houston-Bogota are Continental. When in Bogota I called the Continental line to check about possibility of return date change. The Customer Service rep said my flights were book through United so I would have to contact them for any changes. The problem is they do not operate in Colombia so did not know how to contact them. Aircraft's covering this route are uncomfortable 737-800 for a 4.5 hr international flight the return flight did not have TV or music options. I was used to AA broad body aircraft's for international travel which are more appropriate. I guess for the fare paid I could not ask much but I would not repeat the trip.,7continental-airlines,12/12/11,Flew non-stop from San Francisco to Newark NJ. My complaint concerns insufficient overhead luggage space. As you know the passengers board from the back of the plane. I was in aisle #23 about mid-way on the plane. Yet by the time I boarded all the overhead space was taken. This is due to the incompetence of airline personnel who routinely allow people to take luggage on the plane that clearly exceeds the size limits. I flagged down a flight attendant and insisted that she find room for my luggage. Of course the airline is ultimately to blame for charging people to check luggage the first piece should be free.,2continental-airlines,07/12/11,Dulles to Houston and the crew did a great job. Regional jets are not comfortable for flying half way across the country there is very little room for carry on luggage mine had to go in the cargo area. For the prices we pay for flights the airline needs to at least provide a sandwich for an early morning trip. I have flown many times in the past and am getting to the point that I would rather drive.,3continental-airlines,06/12/11,"Heathrow to Newark. Check-in was impersonal and the few people that were available to help when my passport would not scan were ill informed and were unable to answer questions. Outbound flight was acceptable although food was cold. Our return flight which was a night flight was atrocious! As we had not reserved seats on our outbound flight we were advised to reserve them 24 hours prior to departure for our flight home. We duly did this and foolishly moved seats from those that had been allocated for us. The seats that we booked were in row 14 and we were unaware until we boarded the plane that these were non- reclining seats. Had the online booking system made this clear we would never have booked these seats. My husband is 6'2"" and had to attempt to be comfortable in his seat with the seat in front reclined on top of him and his TV screen about 10"" from his face. Flight attendants were extremely apologetic and said that we could move seats but that we would have to sit separately. Once again my food was cold and this time inedible. We also struggled to put our 'carry-on' luggage into the overhead storage as many people had stowed suitcases. Whilst we cannot fault the flight attendants for their service my husband was knocked by one or the other of the ladies each time they came past him. Overall our experience of Continental Airlines was very poor and we will not use them again. It is all very well to provide cheap flights but value for money should also imply customer satisfaction.",1continental-airlines,04/12/11,EWR to BOM return. The flight attendants seemed rude and apathetic to passengers' needs. Instead of trying to make the 15 hr flight tolerable they tended to add to the stress level of passengers. In fact soon after boarding I remember the flight attendants screaming at passengers to sit down. They seemed annoyed when requested for even minor help like requesting an extra blanket and looked at you with disdain if you dared to ask whether they carried a certain newspaper.,1continental-airlines,01/12/11,"We just completed a so-called Business/First Class trip to and from India and the only thing ""first class"" about it were the new bed seats. For the most part flight attendants seem 'tired' of their jobs - when I asked to be shown how to use the lighting the stewardess replied that she was not familiar enough with it to be of help. In previous years food service was exceptional this time there was no liquor cart and you had to ask for a drink. Breakfast was thrown at us in the last 45 mins of the trip. The overall quality of the food was very poor overcooked and not very well presented. Continental used to do a lot better. Hopefully their merger with United will help put them back on track.",1continental-airlines,01/12/11,LHR-EWR-PHX Business 1st. Check-in at LHR T4 was ok at best. Not a huge line but not tightly run. Will say they were informative about lounge and gate area. Same person that checked me in came on the plane to address each 1st pax. Seats comfortable and well appointed. IFE was good managed to keep my attention but not the most up to date. Food was very good. Have to say service was spotty depending on who was serving. FA forgot drinks / what was ordered throughout flight but noticed the FA for the other aisle was spot on. Appetizer cart then main. Followed by ice cream dessert. EWR-PHX leg in 1st - again comfortable. Direct TV was nice to have but nothing to watch! Have to say again meal was very good. Having transited to Europe on another carrier CO will be merging with hope the level of service and quality skews to CO as they offered a better product.,10continental-airlines,30/11/11,We upgraded to First Class and had to fight for everything we wanted. The flight attendant started by offering us either water or orange juice. The food offered was the same as the food in Economy and when asked for more they told us one package per person and no washroom for just First Class. The First Class flight attendant assigned to take care of 6 people helped more with Economy class and even ignored our repeated calls for service. We finally arrived at Toronto International Airport in a rain storm and were told to get off the plane and walk. We will never fly Continental or United Airlines again.,4continental-airlines,25/11/11,SDQ-EWR. The arrogance of the Continental crew is only surpassed by their lack of competence. No individual entertainment system despite this being a 4 hr flight and the choice of movie was inappropriate for children. The food was awful.,1continental-airlines,25/11/11,MCO-EWR-LHR. Very poor service and I've flown with many airlines over the past 7 years. 757-200 MCO-EWR was just about acceptable however the overnight service from EWR-LHR was dreadful. No priority boarding for Star Alliance Gold Members or Business Class pax 7 hrs on what appeared a very old 757-200. Food was appalling and inedible FA's totally disinterested I don't expect much in economy but other airlines manage so why not CO. I wont be using them again after 7 years of Gold membership I'm very much thinking of switching my loyalty to another alliance/airline if this is the best United/Continental can offer.,1continental-airlines,23/11/11,London-Newark and Newark-Costa Rica. The international leg was fine. The outward trip to CR was just awful. No entertainment system unless you wanted to pay one drink and one snack no blanket or pillow. The staff just seemed to disappear. The return leg was better. More drinks and two snacks but still no free entertainment system. I would not choose to use Continental again unless I had no choice.,3continental-airlines,18/11/11,The food in the forward cabin from Liberia Costa Rica to Houston Texas was virtually inedible. The passengers in economy were told there was only one choice rather than several available for purchase which is inexcusable on a flight of more than 3 hours. The connecting flight to Denver already delayed for an hour without explanation from the crew. the purser and 3 other flight attendants stood talking in the forward galley without offering a glass of water or other beverage to the first class passengers for more than 30 mins. When service was given it was grudging save for one attendant. The merger despite corporate ads to the contrary have done nothing for customer service. We would choose to fly almost any other airline overseas and certainly Frontier rather than the new United domestically.,4continental-airlines,17/11/11,NRT-EWR flight. Perpetually uncooperative and tired crew. Not interested in smiling. Unbelievably poor quality breads. Crew not interested in coming round for a second time to serve despite being in the business cabin.,1continental-airlines,16/11/11,Manchester to Newark. Flight was on time and staff were friendly and provided an excellent service providing drinks throughout as well as trolley services. The return journey was a little late leaving due to problems with air traffic control but the Captain kept passengers informed about the delay. My seat pitch was sufficient but I wish airlines would deter passengers from reclining their seats when there is limited space available especially when tables are down for eating/drinking.,8continental-airlines,09/11/11,SEA-EWR-BOS-IAH-SEA. On all flights staff were indifferent or just plain rude. Seat comfort nice until I boarded final leg of my journey. I expected 737-900 to be modern and comfortable as 3 previous aircraft's but looking at the interior it seemed to be too old for 737-900. Seat pitch tiny and seats narrowest I have seen. Continental has become substandard at par with US Airways. Beverages offered - cup of ice with splash of soda or juice. Only SEA-EWR had entertainment system working as for others it didn't exist or was broken. Service was just awful.,2continental-airlines,03/11/11,Birmingham-Newark. Excellent service. Only grumble - I had reserved seats for both ways (Row 10ABC). Fine going out coming in after automatic check in at Newark found ourselves on Row 38ABC - disappointing. Cabin Crew on both segments were on hand if needed.,8continental-airlines,02/11/11,LAX-IAH-EZE in Business First. LAX Presidents Club fine. Initial domestic leg was good with an older but friendly crew. Day time food good and wine OK. Attentive throughout the flight. Second segment was on a 777-300 where we weren't able to be seated together. A passenger overhearing the request kindly offered to move. The level of service continued to be poor the food and wine was also below standard. The amenity kit was good. The crew gave the impression they were just going through the motions.,3continental-airlines,24/10/11,TPA-IAH-PHX in coach. Exit row seat TPA-IAH regular coach seat IAH-PHX. Big difference in room and comfort! Full planes on both segments but even with all that carry on both flights on time. Still amazes me how everyone crams near the gate at the beginning of boarding and are turned away due to them trying to board early. Kudos to the gate agents for controlling that. Power source nice to have to stay charged. Direct TV available if you are willing to pay if not you are on your own.,8continental-airlines,20/10/11,"On a recent flight DEN-LAS we were charged $75.00 each as we flew on a flight standby earlier than our scheduled fight. Three other people we knew travelling the same flight also earlier (Standby) were not charged the $75 fee. We currently (my wife and I) have over 60000 miles with Continental although we are not Elite status. None of the three other people we knew on the flight were ""Elite"" status either although they were not charged? I've written a formal complaint to Continental Airlines and have not heard back from them it's been two weeks now since the written complaint.",4continental-airlines,19/10/11,While traveling to Orlando from Belfast my family (my husband and 2 sons who were 3yrs 9 months and myself) stopped over in Newark. The flight was late and we had a short connection. We would not have made it if it had not been for our angel a Continental Employee who helped us out so much. She was amazing and because of her we not only made the flight but had time to spare. I can not thank her enough. Traveling with small kids was nightmare and she made our experience in the airport a dream. 6 months later and we still appreciate the wonderful help.,7continental-airlines,17/10/11,Newark to London Heathrow. Overhead lockers jammed packed full with oversize luggage which none of the ground or flight attendants seemed to pay any attention to albeit that their was a luggage guide frame at the boarding desk. This in turn led to chaotic passenger boarding! Surely there is a limit to the size and amount of cabin stored luggage? Footway aisles in the rows were grossly overloaded with excess baggage. Surely a safety issue let alone an inconvenience to passengers who are prepared to have luggage put in the hold.,5continental-airlines,09/10/11,NY to Cleveland for business. The experience was good and I felt comfortable - I bought extra leg room for a small amount of money. I wouldn't say that it's necessarily worth it for the short flights but I can see how it can make a difference in longer flights. I also found out that I can add the miles to my miles & more account.,7continental-airlines,09/10/11,LFT-IAH-EWR-PWM. CO Express ERJ 145 regional LFT-IAH with nice onboard service. We used the Presidents Club at IAH and wonderful service at the bar. B767-400ER IAH-EWR were told champagne was no longer available on domestic first class flights. Excellent cabin service with a nice lunch. BusinessFirst sleeper seats were comfortable on this relatively short domestic leg. Used the Presidents Club at EWR and it was fine. CO Connection Dash 8-Q400 EWR to PWM although this was a new aircraft there is no escaping the fact that a turboprop is slower with a much noisier cabin than a regional jet. On board service was lackluster. Bags although priority tagged took a long time to arrive at the baggage claim.,8continental-airlines,04/10/11,Birmingham to Newark and onto Cincinnati return. I felt I got good value. Flights were on time slightly delayed but only due to air traffic control. I paid for the extra leg room seats as I am tall. The inflight entertainment was good own screen with a library of films and programs/music to choose from. Flight attendants from BHX to EWR were nice and the only 'not so nice' one was on my return from Cincinnati but it hardly ruined my experience. Only issue was the food - I ordered an Asian Vegetarian meal and got curry (both ways) fine but not at 11 am. And as my 'snack' I got a carrot roll. Awful. Eat before you go.,8continental-airlines,03/10/11,LAX-IAH-BOG outbound in First/Business PTY-IAH-LAX return in Economy. Redeye to Bogota. LAX-IAH flight was cancelled was proactively booked on an earlier flight to make my connection to Bogota and was grateful for the forward thinking. Food limited in the Presidents Club - just cheese and crackers but good wine and they kept the shower open for me for my midnight departure. IAH-BOG flight attendants extremely rude. Seemed hurried and unable to cope. Food ok and the 737 Y seats had limited recline. Return flight PTY-IAH comfortable in coach. IAH-LAX you could tell that it was an EWR crew as they were ruder and less polished. Uncomfortable flight but all in all a good experience.,7continental-airlines,03/10/11,MIA-EWR 737-700 (Business) upgrade. CO terminal at MIA outdated compared to AA's. Ground personnel were sufficiently attentive to direct you to where you needed to go. Aircraft needed some cleaning and sitting at the bulkhead was painful given the limited legroom. Business Class breakfast and frequent refreshments were welcomed. Glad to fly them again next week to Mexico on their 777-200 between Newark and Houston.,8continental-airlines,30/09/11,I was returning from Frankfurt. The flight was late arriving and I missed my connection to Los Angles. At this point I did not know what to do I went to the Continental desk and explained my dilemma. The counter attendant and her supervisor treated me with disdain and I was embarrassed by their behaviour. Needless to say I was given a hotel room and left the next day. I will be very hesitant to fly Continental again.,2continental-airlines,25/09/11,We chose Continental for our flight to Hong Kong because it was cheap. Arrived at the airport 2.5 hrs early we were told our chosen flight was late and we would miss our connecting flight if we were to take it. We ended up sprinting across the airport to make a different flight and barely made it. An hour into our connecting flight after our layover we were told there were technical problems so they had to turn back the plane. On arrival back to the US we sat onboard for 5-6 hrs. They only explained to us how long it would take and we were only given a bag of peanuts and a drink. I begged an attendant for an extra bag of peanuts and eventually she gave it to me.,2continental-airlines,25/09/11,Newark to Seattle. The plane was full however I could not believe how little room the seat provided in Economy Class. I am 5 ft 10 190 lbs and I felt extremely uncomfortable. On my return flight I took United which operated an Airbus rather than the 737. I also opted to spend $69 for more leg room but I did feel the width of the seat was wider than the Continental flight. I understand the two airlines are merging and I hope United does not 'shrink' the seats as a result. The whole experience from paying for the one piece of luggage I had to paying for a meal if I desired makes me long for the 'good old days'.,2continental-airlines,24/09/11,IAH-BWI. B737-900. Inflight entertainment was good. They have Direct TV installed and stream live programs. Its costly though. Food and drinks were pretty much standard. Flight took off and landed on time.,9continental-airlines,18/09/11,Pittsburgh to Chicago. Overall the flight was nice the aircraft clean and the staff friendly. I really like the Direct TV added to the seats however the price was ridiculous to say the least. $5.99 for flights 2 hrs or less and $7.99 for longer flights. IMHO regular commercial TV should be free and $5.99/$7.99 should be for premium commercial free content like movies HBO Showtime and Sports. I didn't see anyone using it past the free preview on the entire flight once the blue pop-up came up I opened my laptop and watched a DVD. Another thing that gets me is the Boarding. There is no advantage to preferred boarding anymore everyone is some kind of club member airline branded credit card holder or something special that gets to board early. If you are flying with infants the overheads are filled before you get on the aircraft and it is a pain to have herd your family over a bunch of pre- boarders giving you dirty looks as you try to carry a baby and 4 bags and manage a child as you inch down the plane. I thought that I had preferred boarding on my last flight and two groups in addition to the military disabled and first-class boarding before me.,6continental-airlines,15/09/11,Edinburgh to Newark return to Edinburgh. Both flights left early and arrived an hour before scheduled landing. Legroom room better than any charter flight and no worse than a budget airline which Continental is. Food was what it is you can't expect 5 star cuisine. Cabin crew friendly and worked hard. I read so many negative reviews I was dreading the flight but it was great. I'm just glad I can fly direct from Edinburgh to New York and don't have to go to London to change and 7 hr flight time isn't that long. I feel I got what I paid for.,9continental-airlines,14/09/11,I am a frequent flyer with Elite status. I loved Continental service in the past but since the merger with United the flying experience has become at times miserable. United has pretty awful customer service. They do not communicate at the gate leaving passengers wondering what is going on when things are running late which is often. Then when they load the plane it is absolute chaos. Twice in the last month I've been on a flight to Chicago and no announcement at all was made to board. They simply opened the door and people started pushing toward it. I prefer not to pay over $500 per ticket to be treated this way. Lack of communication. I recently flew US Air and was pleasantly surprised.,2continental-airlines,12/09/11,Edinburgh to Newark. Newark to Orlando. The only good things about this flight was the legroom and punctuality of all flight sectors even with storms in New York we were not delayed. Food was awful and not enough for a long haul flight with only a croissant for breakfast. Your own TV did not have a great choice of movies. I would class Continental as a budget airline and not a great one at that. Improve food and movie choice and they would be better. Do not choose row 14 in their 757s or 737s seats don't recline.,4continental-airlines,12/09/11,Newark-Dublin tickets booked 7 months ahead only to be assigned the last 2 seats in the last row of the plane - row 40 E/F. Having to sit with a queue of passengers waiting for the toilet standing in our faces for over 4 hrs of a 6 hr flight. This was intrusive uncomfortable and most upsetting for us. Furthermore we were unable to recline our seats for a bit of comfort seeing that our seats were right up against the bulkhead furthermore a tall passenger sitting in front of my husband's seat had reclined her seat to the maximum with her long legs sticking up over the seat in front. We felt trapped and I was unable to get out of my seat to use the toilet or stretch my back during the whole 6 hr flight. Obviously if we could afford to fly Business class we would but seeing that we can't all it would have taken was a little kindly observant thoughtfulness and consideration.,continental-airlines,11/09/11,Newark to Heathrow. The flight was scheduled for 9.10 pm but was delayed. We finally took off at 10 pm. Very small cramped plane the staff whilst not rude were tired looking and not helpful. I will not fly Continental again. The planes are small little leg room and the staff not as professional as those with other carriers.,2continental-airlines,10/09/11,Sadly I was caught up in Hurricane Irene I was stuck in the US for an extra 6 days with no clear sign of when I would get home as CA phone lines were jammed and when I did get in the on-hold queue I was disconnected after 2 hrs. This happened 5/6 times. I held for a total of 22.5 hours before speaking to someone 4 days after my original flight home had been cancelled. The flight home via Newark was on a small almost domestic sized planes which allowed no real room for comfort or sleep. Other passengers taller than myself didn't cope quite as well. Overall not a good experience for me due to poor CA updates and the lack of being able to talk to someone. However I will say that the CA advisor I did eventually speak with was apologetic sympathetic and a good ambassador for CA.,1continental-airlines,01/09/11,Arrived at the airport 3 hrs ahead of time only to be faced with long line up because several agents were dealing with people who came to the airport late. 40 mins prior to our flight we were pulled out of line requesting that we immediately check-in. We did this only to be told that no seats were assigned so onboard we asked the attendant if our family could be seated together. The attendants response was that we catch the next flight out. Her tone of voice and response was out of line and rude.,continental-airlines,30/08/11,"Birmingham-Cancun via Newark. Seat space tight and I am only 5'3"". Food was poor I had the vegetarian option which wasn't so appealing. Inflight entertainment ok on Birmingham-Newark leg however headphones had to be purchased for Newark to Cancun leg of the journey. On the return trip flight was cancelled due to snow this in itself wasn't the issue but the attitude of the staff made this minor issue an awful experience. I was diverted via Houston with a short connection time this flight was delayed resulting in me missing my connection. Inflight cabin crew had no idea about flight schedules and didn't help us to disembark the plane first. Spent the night at Houston to get the flight the next day rude and dismissive staff no attempt to help or even be polite to people in a difficult position.",continental-airlines,29/08/11,Staff were rude and impatient and passengers seemed to be a bother to them. The seats hardly reclined and my 5 hr trip became quite uncomfortable. While the price was right I would pay a little more for a quality flight.,continental-airlines,27/08/11,Glasgow to Newark. Most flight attendants were unable to smile. Check-in on return was awful self check-in is confusing. A staff member approached as I was unsure what to do and started barking instructions at me.,4continental-airlines,27/08/11,I had booked my parents tickets PA to Mumbai via Newark. On arrival at the airport we were taken to one side and told our flight to Newark had been cancelled. In a rude manner we were told we had 2 options to take the train to Newark and fly from there or change the journey date. My parents age are over 65 years old plus my mother needs a wheelchair and cant walk the train was impossible with bags and check-in at Newark. Our tickets were changed however they failed to notify us. Finally after much trouble my parents boarded a flight to Mumbai from Newark.,continental-airlines,26/08/11,EWR to BRU return. Seats were uncomfortable with little cushion and there was a metal box underneath the seat in front on both flights so I couldn't stretch my legs. Food was poor quality and they charged for alcoholic beverages. Crew were friendly and the individual seatback screens were nice with lots of entertainment. I would not recommend Continental for international flights.,5continental-airlines,26/08/11,EWR-LIM. Adequate at best. Flight departed on time but the cabin was worn out and the food was nasty. There were also brown burn stains on the outside of the tray. The only saving grace was the excellent video on demand entertainment. The food was awful though.,6continental-airlines,24/08/11,EWR to YYZ. Flight delayed 4.5 hrs due to bad weather. Passengers were required to wait 4.5 hrs for the arrival of a pilot. The flight took off over 9 hrs late airport staff would not give any answers to questions and seemed to be avoiding them. No compensation offered.,continental-airlines,21/08/11,IAD to SFO. Despite booking seats next to each other our seats were changed and we were 10 rows apart. Other couples faced the same problem despite the bookings being on the same eticket. Our previous Continental flight was 4 hrs late with no apology from ground cabin or flight deck staff. Service was very poor.,continental-airlines,20/08/11,CDG-IAD in Business First on a 757-200. The Lie-Flat Business First seat is very comfortable. Flight on time and the crew friendly and professional. The only negative were the rude Continental employees who conduct the US immigration/security checks prior to entering the check-in area.,7continental-airlines,18/08/11,Round the World trip from Brisbane. We boarded United Airlines (operated by Continental) from Boston to Edinburgh. We boarded late due to weather the plane had not been properly cleaned (candy wrappers used tissues in seat pocket. Charged $6 for small lite beer only to be told they did not accept cash. Food provided was the most poorly presented we have ever had. We have been Star Alliance customers for many years and have flown with most of the Alliance Airlines but without doubt this Flight was the worst.,continental-airlines,18/08/11,BOS-EWR in Economy on 12.59pm out of Boston. Normally a 1 hr trip this time 6 hrs. After numerous excuses over a 70 mins period flight cancelled completely. Two incompetent gate agents trying to re-route very long line of frustrated passengers with connections out of Newark. After waiting over 1 hr for agents to process 4 passengers ahead of us and having missed the next flight to Newark we were put on the 4.30pm with assurances our luggage would follow us. Needless to say it did not make it to Newark with us on our or the next flight.,continental-airlines,14/08/11,EWR-BRU in Elite First. Pleasantly surprised professional cabin crew 4 staff for the first section of the Business cabin on the new B777. Food good quality for a US carrier. Seats comfortable allowing a couple of hours of sleep. Entertainment system was very good with a selection of movies and TV series. Arrived in Brussels well ahead of schedule.,9continental-airlines,11/08/11,We were very worried about flying Continental I have to say they were very good. We were a party of 5 and nothing was to much trouble. Flying from Birmingham to New York the plane was clean and tidy a good selection on the entertainment system and the food was hot and filling.,10continental-airlines,10/08/11,I flew from Chicago-Houston at 3 am. The plane was an old and dirty 737-800 the seats were hard and staff were rude. They were advertising some TV shows they would be showing but were nowhere to be found.,1continental-airlines,09/08/11,Booked to fly Virgin LHR-New York codeshare meant I flew back with Continental. Excellent service comfortable 3-3-3 Boeing 777 layout. Tasty dinner and breakfast and professional crew.,10continental-airlines,09/08/11,Our outbound fight to Edinburgh from Newark was okay except there is very little leg-room. I could not recline my seat properly. Alcoholic drinks were not free. On the return they asked for volunteers to get bumped I volunteered. They told me to board so I did only to be told to leave the plane and collect a voucher I was just about to leave the terminal when I was told to re-board. After 2 hours the flight is cancelled. Staff rude and hostile no information provided. Given ticket on BMI to LHR. Delayed flight but at least BMI gave its passengers access to the Business Class lounge. Arrive at Newark 30 hours later than planned.,continental-airlines,03/08/11,Alexandria LA to Houston TX return. Houston to Alexandria flights were very uncomfortable. The smaller aircraft Saab SF 340A/B very warm and never cooled down during the 45 min flight. The cabins exhibit a lot of wear/tear and are very dusty/dirty. Noticed some deep gashes in the overhead carry-on compartments and several areas where the pieces of steel broken from where the seats are secured. Magazine bags dirty with threads hanging from them. Returning from Houston I was assigned seat 3A but someone had already been given this seat. The attendant moved me to a seat by the door unfortunately this was awkward for myself having muscular deficits so once everyone had boarded the FA moved me.,3continental-airlines,02/08/11,PHL to Houston to Cancun but left PHL late since they had to replenish the oxygen. We kept being told we would arrive on time into Houston however we had lost our take-off slot. In Houston the doors opened 15 mins before the Cancun flight was supposed to take off. Being at the back of the plane it took some time to get out Ran through the airport to be told our seats had been given to standby passengers. We were given hotel and food vouchers but then they came up with the idea to fly us to Corzumel. Were told our luggage would be on that flight but it did not arrive and has still not be traced according to their website. Continental offered money for clothes but it far from ideal.,2continental-airlines,02/08/11,FLL-EYW on Beechcraft operated by Gulfstream International Airlines. Aircraft was OK taking into account it's 19-seater staff could be better both on ground and on board (first officer seemed like he didn't want people on board). There is no service since it's only 50 mins long flight and there are no flight attendants. Not bad but could be better.,7continental-airlines,01/08/11,A direct flight from Newark to Phoenix. Arrived at the airport 5:30AM. Checked in and booked baggage day before. All we had to do at Newark Airport was give them our luggage. The Continental employee told us to go to the outside skycap for checking baggage. It was a long line. We waited so long we were locked out of our flight. No one cared. We finally got baggage put through inside (after much stress). We raced to the flight and missed it by a minute. Customer Service did book us on a later flight but did it unwillingly. Everyone at Continental was rude. We missed a whole day of vacation. I will never fly Continental again.,continental-airlines,01/08/11,The flight to France was delayed for 6 hrs at Newark airport. There were no satisfying explanation given to passengers. The $6 food voucher came 3 hrs later when most restaurants were about to close. We needed a wheel chair that never showed up. We were denied pillow and blankets for my elderly diabetic mother after waiting in the airport for 7 hrs. The staff left the desk unattended to avoid answering the passengers. The list goes on and on.,continental-airlines,31/07/11,BRU-EWR-BRU was fairly good in-flight entertainment was nice. Plane looked new and clean legroom was sufficient food was ok although cabin crew seemed to be a little indifferent.,7continental-airlines,30/07/11,"San Jose-Anchorage-Vancouver-San Jose. To get to ANC I had to connect on Denver that flight after being delayed for more than 4 hrs without any explanation was cancelled the Gate Attendant only told that us your flight was cancelled this is the phone number for all of you to call Reservations Dpt. When I called Reservations they offered me a flight that departed DEN 2 days after. I had to buy a new ticket with a different airline at that time only First Class was available so I paid more for that portion of the trip than I had paid for the rest of my itinerary. As I didn't use the rebooked flight they cancelled the rest of my reservation so the day that I was coming home was a total headache to get seats. Again without any notice they decided to change the aircraft and this new one didn't have the ""C"" seat position in Economy class therefore it departed with more than 1 hr of delay while the Gate Attendants manually found seats for the passengers that originally had seats on that position.",continental-airlines,26/06/11,This was our first time and our last time flying Continental. We had planned this vacation for 4 months and was very excited until the nightmare begin with continental airlines. We left first flight on time then arrived at our connecting flight in 3 hrs instead of the 2 hrs as schedule. Missing our connecting flight due to flight being longer. Continental never tried to offer us another flight to final destination on the same day-but did say we could fly out 1 day later. We stayed in the Houston airport for 8 hrs on standby flights with 25+ others with no assistance from continental going from gate to gate with no direction . Until finally we demanded that we be confirmed on some flight or a refund. The customers service was not helpful/friendly at all. After being confirmed all our times had changed for arrival back home. Coming back they cancel our fight so we spent another 8 hrs waiting until continental put us on another airlines - we flew out of way and waited again. The fill in airlines treated us much better than Continental. We lost 1 day of our planned vacation - 1 day from work due to not be able to arrive as schedule. We were very dissatisfied with continental service. Actually we were treated better by the Continental foreign country airlines customer services than the USA customer service.,1continental-airlines,26/06/11,Houston-Sao Paulo-Houston. Fully loaded planes (767-300) with on time departure and arrival but extremely bad service. Flight attendants disappeared after serving dinner never to be seen again. If you want water you have to get up and get it. I pushed the flight attendant button so many times that I gave up. Breakfast: 4 pieces of fruit a soggy croissant jam and coffee that tasted like dishwashing water.,3continental-airlines,25/06/11,It was another miserable experience with Continental. We arrived at the Cozumel airport 2 hrs early then stood a line in the lobby for 1.5 hrs as 2 or 3 Con people checked in an airplane full of international travellers. We arrived at Bush International 5 mins late then sat on the runway for 20 mins waiting for a gate to open. We rushed to the gate only to find the times continually pushed back so that the plane ultimately took off at midnight rather than 19.30. It had been held in El Paso because the temperature was 107-the Embraer was rated to take off at 104 or less.,continental-airlines,13/06/11,"EWR-DUB CDG-EWR. Check in at Newark with ong lines. Dinner after take off wasn't too bad they had to reset the AVOD twice making my movie restart to the beginning. Light breakfast before landing. Trip home from CDG as good drinks and pretzels after take off then meal which was very good. Staff came around with drinks throughout flight. Landed on time and customs quick at EWR. Baggage was left in CDG due to security reason"" and was sent to my house the next day. Overall service was great but the price was a little high compared to our other options.",8continental-airlines,01/06/11,Trip to Las Vegas from Indianapolis. Had a stop-over in Cleveland Ohio. On the trip home our flight out of Cleveland was cancelled and we were told we could not get a flight until Sunday. This was Indy 500 weekend so we figure they sold our seats for $. We were sent home by a 5hr hour bus ride. Onboard seats are small and leg room so little that even though we are both slender we were very uncomfortable. We won't choose this airline again nor will we recommend it to others.,2continental-airlines,01/06/11,On the flight from LA to Houston no one checked hand carry luggage. Some bags should have been checked and stored in baggage compartment - the number of hand carried items were excessive leading to no storage space overhead in your selected seats. When I asked for help staff was not interested.,2continental-airlines,31/05/11,Rudest staff ever encountered on an airline - staff were surly sarcastic and very unfriendly. I was ignored by one of the hostesses when I requested a newspaper from her trolley as she was in so much of a rush to get up the aisle due to the fact that they were late boarding the plane. Food tasted like the sort of food you got on planes 20 years ago - inedible pasta a limp salad and a stale bread roll does not make an appetizing meal.,1continental-airlines,28/05/11,"The in-flight service on Lima - Newark flight was dismal. Our row was overlooked when the meal was served. When I went to ask for our meal there was no apology and I was left with the feeling that I had inconvenienced the flight attendants. When I went to queue for the lavatory I also informed the flight attendant that the mother sitting alongside us would like some milk for her child. A hand emerged from behind the curtain with a cup of milk for ME to take to the mother. I didn't mind taking the milk but it's surely part of the flight attendant's duties to see to passengers' needs. We had one and a half hours to make our connecting flight to Heathrow. We didn't make it. Why does Continental put passengers under this kind of pressure knowing that you now have to wait for your luggage  go through immigration and check in your luggage again? The booking of a later flight (9hrs later) was dealt with in a disorganized and indifferent manner. When I asked if food vouchers would be given the supervisor at first said ""No"" then a grudging ""Give them $8"". The flight attendants on the Newark - Heathrow leg were friendly and efficient. Wish there were more like them!",4continental-airlines,24/05/11,PHX-IAH-MSY economy. Both flights completely full and both on time. Seating tight but managed ok. Very little leg room thankfully seats have limited recline. FAs made frequent drink runs. All in all decent trip.,8continental-airlines,23/05/11,EWR-HKG on B-777. New airplane IFE really good. Crew polite and helpful. Food was nowhere to compare with most Asian or European carrier.,8continental-airlines,22/05/11,London-Houston on B777. Crew were great half full cabin. Aircraft was clean lie flat seat very comfortable food tasty. Large PTV. An added bonus was that in Houston I did not have to collect my bag for the onward flight to Panama and there was a special immigration queue for connecting passengers which meant I was back airside within 15 minutes of landing.,10continental-airlines,21/05/11,Manchester-Newark-Grand Rapids. Online check-in did not work. B757-200 old noisy airplane for long haul. Inefficient scruffy looking rude staff. Alcoholic drinks charged for. Horrible sub-standard meals. US immigration staff at Newark airport nice. Flight from Newark to Grand Rapids delayed due to tech fault. Only soft drinks served on 2 hour flight. Overall terrible experience.,2continental-airlines,18/05/11,Delayed and stranded! First we it was going to be 6pm so we arrived at SFO at 4pm to learn that flight was delayed 40 min. The second delay notice came as 7.40pm. We were exhausted after a 5 hour long drive and finally relieved when boarding started somewhere around 7pm. But then there was a problem with the pilot. We were inside what was a smelly and hot aircraft for nearly an hour until the pilot came and started the engine. Then it began to cool down but had to wait another half an hour to start the trip. Finally it was 2am when we arrived at Houston. Was a lot of waste of time for a four plus hour trip. The only good thing was the cabin crew.,2continental-airlines,17/05/11,Horrible experience yesterday at Newark! Our flight was moved four times to a different gate and then cancelled - no explanation. Customer service was appalling and abrasive and I was even threatened with the Port Authority Police when I demanded to know the reason for the cancellation. At the end I had to sleep at the airport after a long international trip. Please save yourself the aggravation and book your next flight with a real airline!,continental-airlines,16/05/11,EWR-BOG-EWR flight used to be on a 757-200. The 5 hours flight was comfortable enough. Within years it all went down. No Business first then no B757. Now the B737-500 to 800 are cramped small and not convenient for such international flight.,4continental-airlines,16/05/11,"I missed a flight because my first flight was delayed - they couldn't book me till the next day and didn't pay for any hotel accommodation. They had 2 representatives to take care of a line of about 40 people all who had missed flights. One of the representatives was designated to ""elite members"" but then the other worker began taking elite members only too. This left no one for the other 40 of us!",continental-airlines,16/05/11,Extremely poor customer service for Newark-Mumbai flight. The flight was heavily overbooked and instead of helping the customers with other available options the attendants were screaming at them. Even on volunteering to go by an alternate route I was not given a boarding pass on time for the alternate flight. The attendants were rude and refused to answer my queries.,1continental-airlines,14/05/11,TPA-EWR-LHR. Check in a joke. Not obvious what was what. Self checkin was confusing and required help from someone who didn't look like they were employed at the airport but were still behind the desk. At the gate they had part-timers who were not very good at crowd control. Flight delayed due to bad weather in Newark and we were getting updates every 30 minutes until about 2 hours then nothing for another 2 hours until departure announcement by that point most passengers had rescheduled including me. Staff at the desk to reschedule were fantastic and had a good chat. They put me on the one the next morning which was full and had drinks but not much else. EWR-LHR was on a 757 tiny plane fully booked and every seat had a power adaptor in the footwell so uncomfortable. Only managed about 30 minutes of sleep from the collection of trays to the lights being turned back on. They also hadn't seated a young daughter with her father so required a voluntary seat change I don't see how that situation even arose?,5continental-airlines,08/05/11,MAN-EWR. Incredibly slow check in (took over 1 hour) - about 4 open desks 1 of which was for Business. When this early in the morning you don't want to be waiting for more than an hour in a line! Onboard all was good meals average but the aircraft was quite clean tidy and with personal AVOD system.,8continental-airlines,01/05/11,LHR-EWR EWR-MSY and MSY via IAD to LHR. Most flights on time. Onboard IFE was very good for a US carrier. Food not brilliant but our expectations were low in the first place. FA efficient and friendly enough.,7continental-airlines,27/04/11,EWR-HNL-EWR. Continental no longer gives out complimentary food on this 10 hour+ flight from Newark to Hawaii. And to make matters worse my original ticket said that meals were included but I was never contacted about the changed policy. I ended up having just a small snack before boarding and was shocked to see only food for purchase offered (which they ran out of). Pretty disgraceful for a long-haul flight!,4continental-airlines,26/04/11,Heathrow to Houston with Continental. Found the flight attendants rude and they appeared to be put out when you asked them a question. Although I had booked a vegetarian meal there was no vegetarian option for one of the meals - only a meat sandwich. The flight attendant did not care and I was denied a meal. On the return I asked at check in to confirm my vegetarian meal had been ordered. The reply was along the lines that if there wasn't a vegetarian meal onboard then I should make do with what there was available - eg. remove the meat from the meal. I did receive my vegetarian meal this time but it was frozen and by the time it had defrosted I discovered it wasn't worth the wait. We were left with the trays on our tables for 45mins before flight attendants came around to remove the rubbish. If at all possible the flight attendants were even more rude on the return journey and incredibly inefficient. They are by far and away the worst airline I have ever had.,1continental-airlines,25/04/11,Over inflated flight attendants think they have all the power in the universe one decided to eject a MM+ Platinum from the aircraft because she wanted the seat (up front near the door). Will never again fly this airline - after 15+ years of loyalty I'm done.,continental-airlines,18/04/11,TPA-EWR-FRA. B737 ex TPA was 90 minutes late due to mechanics in EWR. Enough time to change in EWR however the airport was a chaos with permanent changing gates and Presidents Club being more than full and unpleasant. B777 to FRA great lie-flat seat good IFE and crew helpful & friendly. Food was ok nothing special.,9continental-airlines,17/04/11,Newark to Frankfurt. Poor service and poor food compared with other airlines on the same route. They charge high prices for drinks of any kind and everything is served in the same time around. Frankfurt to Newark used Lufthansa - same price but what a difference in service and quality. At Lufthansa the food was good and we were served repeatedly. And no payment for anything. No wonder the Lufthansa flight was fully booked while in the Continental flight had many empty seats.,3continental-airlines,17/04/11,LHR-EWR-LHR. Cabin Crew okay food except breakfast okay breakfast - 5 pieces of fruit plus croissant. Both flights on time baggage arrived operated by B757-200 with PTV screen to watch films.,8continental-airlines,17/04/11,LHR-IAH-GRK rtn. LHR-IAH on B777-200 and IAH-GRK Saab340 (Colgan Air). All flights on time. Airport and ground staff helpful and friendly used online check-in and very efficient bag drop at LHR Terminal 4 - took less than 5 minutes to clearing security and getting airside. Seated in 44B both flights on B777 and found seats to comfortable and good value for money. AVOD worked superbly and a huge choice. Cabin crew were OK and did plenty of beverage service. Didn't get a choice of meal but sitting in the back is a quieter and less crowded cabin. There was no noise or inconvenience from the rear lavs or galley. Continental Connection (Colgan) flights on the little Saab were fine too.,9continental-airlines,03/04/11,Flew Continental from Houston to Guadalajara. Flight was cancelled due to no flight crew. Had a 4+ hour delay. Is this any way to run a company? I think not. Will continue to use this airline as they are only non-stop service but can't wait until Southwest has direct service thru Volaris.,3continental-airlines,02/04/11,We had a 48 hour delay in a 3rd rate hotel in Puerto Plata Dominican Republic. The subsequent equivalent Continental flights on 03/28/11 and 03/29/11 left on time while the passengers from the 03/27/11 flight remained on the ground. Obviously an alternate airplane was sent for those flights yet no such arrangement nor other arrangement was made for us. Two days represents a considerable expense and lost time to individual passengers as well as to our employers expecting our return to work. Another airplane should have been sent since ours had a mechanical failure. Our seats cost $1100 each because we booked only a month in advance (I have flown much further for much less and arrived on time). The closest thing we got to compensation was a $12 food voucher for use at Newark Airport! I think this experience proves that Continental is uninterested in their passenger's needs. I will do my best to avoid flying Continental again.,continental-airlines,27/03/11,LFT-IAH-MCO. The LFT-IAH flight operated by a Continental Express ERJ-145 was delayed 2.5 hours due to weather. This meant had only 12 minutes to change terminals at IAH and connect to our flight to MCO. Fortunately Continental held our connecting flight so I made it just barely. IAH-MCO on B757-300 in first class. Dinner quite good as was red wine selection. Seats comfortable and service great. My checked bag actually made it as well so I was quite pleased in view of the earlier delay due to weather.,9continental-airlines,27/03/11,"Continental is the most egregious of all airlines when it comes to adding hundreds of dollars in fees for items that used to be free and every time I fly the fees keep going up. Thank goodness my company pays for travel but $120 RT for baggage $188 RT for exit row seats $18 RT for meals - all of which used to be free - is simply egregious. As others said the crew is never very nice and you feel like they are merely trying to tolerate the passengers. I say if they don't like people they shouldn't be in the service industry. I am writing this while on hold with their customer service. First I was on hold for 15 minutes someone picked up by saying ""hello"" and nothing else. I asked for a receipt for the extra legroom and she said ""Let me transfer you to the correct department"" and now I'm back on hold for 10 minutes already. Maybe I'll be on hold for another 15 minutes which will make 35 minutes total to get a receipt sent to me. I checked online and a receipt for extra legroom is not available. Continental has a virtual monopoly on Newark Airport in NJ and they take full advantage of it.",4continental-airlines,24/03/11,Flew with them for the first time from Dublin to New York. Plane out was delayed by 3 and a half hours because the cover for one of the emergency exit lights was missing! We were told for 1 hour that the delay was due to the ongoing servicing of the plane then they finally admitted what the problem was. It took over an hour for a new plastic cover to be sourced and a further hour to get the cover and get us onboard. Then on the way back we were 2 hours delayed because the plane we were getting had been sitting in a different terminal all day and had to be brought over to our gate. God forbid they might plan ahead and get the plane over earlier so that we actually took off on time!,2continental-airlines,20/03/11,SAN-IAH-AMS BRU-EWR-IAH-SAN return. Domestic segments on B737-800. IAH-AMS on B767-400ER. BRU-EWR on B777-200ER. Planes clean and in good repair service professional and friendly food above average and baggage arrived with me. DirectTV on domestic flights a plus older IFE on B767 adequate AVOD on B777 excellent. New lie-flat seats on B777 very comfortable.,9continental-airlines,16/03/11,Continental has gone to the dogs. They publish rules for one pass members but don't follow them. Today I tried to book a flight for February 2012. I called at exactly 1 minute after midnite Houston time. I was put on hold for 1 hour and 50 minutes. I used other phones to call other continental numbers and got recordings saying that their call volume was too high and they could not take my call. At 3am I finally got a real person who said there were no seats on February 15 16 or 17 for One Pass members. I could call back in a few days. This was on the heels of having cancelled one cruise because Continental could get me to Buenos Aires but they could not get me home. It is obvious that they purposely ignore their own rules so that you cannot use acquired miles.,continental-airlines,15/03/11,Just taken a return flight from UK to Newark USA. We paid extra for return flights with extra legroom. We thought this well worthwhile (757 row 21). We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of room and felt the box underneath the seat in front was not a real problem. My gripe with Continental on both outward and return (and you will see this in lots of comments on this site) is our dissatisfaction with cabin crew. They are discourteous arrogant to a very high level and so full of their own importance that is almost incredulous. I for one will never use this airline again.,5continental-airlines,14/03/11,"The worst airline I have used. Flew return UK to Mexico via USA. Cabin crew are the rudest I have met unable to answer questions politely. Found a passenger sitting in one of our seats on inbound flight - crew refused to remove that person so we were forced to sit apart and called ""pathetic"" for wanting to sit in our allocated seats. Told by another crew member they didn't have time to tell us what the drinks options were when we asked. Really poor service all round.",continental-airlines,06/03/11,BHX-EWR-PTY return SJO-EWR-BHX - best and cheapest way of doing this routing. Booking this multi leg and class trip on web site was easy with seat selection at booking no problem - much better than almost all others for odd routes and fare very competitive. Smooth trip both ways with 3 seats for two of us. Also booking business on one leg gets lounge access and early boarding for the other leg - as long as both trips are international. Seats OK AVOD excellent (if a bit American biased) on transatlantic sectors and service routine and efficient rather than warm. All flights on time.,8delta-air-lines,01/08/15,"Coming from Paris to Newark, the plane I was on had 2 out of 3 generators fail, so we had to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Newfoundland. We had to stay on the aircraft from 3pm until 11pm with malfunctioning air-conditioning and toilets. During this time we received one small cheese sandwich and a chocolate bar. The Delta Hub in Atlanta said they would send a plane, then after 3 hours of waiting, the pilot received word that it had not even taken off. When the 'rescue plane' finally arrived after everyone (260 approx) being in the plane for 8 hours, we sat on the rescue plane for another 50 minutes until we finally took off at 12.10am. I arrived at Newark to find my bag had been sent to Atlanta. Because of all of this I missed a connecting flight. I write this from Newark airport, still not reaching my destination of LA. This is not the first time I have had an issue with Delta.",1continental-airlines,05/03/11,EWR-BCN Boeing 757 crew did adequate job. However beware the seating in economy. Many of the economy seats on B757 have extremely limited legroom due to some sort of electronics/media box under the seat in front of you. You can barely put one foot under the seat let alone two. Extremely uncomfortable on a long flight!,6continental-airlines,25/02/11,This is the worst airline I have encountered other than a few dodgy African internal flights where just arriving at your destination is considered a good flight experience. Cabin staff not very friendly at all. The food from Newark to UK was hot on the outside but almost frozen in the middle - they changed it for a different one but it's an uncomfortable feeling having just had a mouthful of undercooked chicken. The seat was the most uncomfortable I have sat in with a hard bar right at the base of my back. We paid more for the extra leg room but with electrical equipment under the seat in front it wasn't as roomy as billed. The entertainment package was good but the headphone socket was in the wrong place and it fell out every time I moved a muscle. The luggage was quick off the plane as was disembarkation. The movies we pretty good and the eventual hot meal was quite tasty.,2delta-air-lines,31/07/15,"Had to connect at Detroit to Boston. Flight landed at Detroit around 2.55, for a 3.20 connection. Talked to the flight attendent, who assured us multiple times that we would be able to make it to our connection. We ended up being excessively late. I normally wouldn't be upset about something like this, but I have been on several flights where they let off people that needed to reach a connection quickly. There was an available solution and the employee failed to use it.",1delta-air-lines,31/07/15,"We arrived at JFK, checked in and promptly went through to the departure lounge. Bought our Duty/Tax free shopping, to be told we couldn't purchase it from that particular shop as we needed to go to a different terminal via bus.
After a fiasco trying to find the lounge (building works going on and no clear notices), we'd walked the full length of the terminal to find our lounge had no Tim Horton's. Well it did, but it was in the domestic flight section, separated by a rope and we weren't allowed to duck under to get coffee so had to go all the way back to the far end of the terminal to get a coffee from Starbucks. That done, we went to find Duty/Tax free shop. When we asked a member of staff where the Duty free shop was, she smirked at us and said there wasn't one. Had I known this I'd have made my purchases prior to my flight to the States. Then we boarded our flight. The seats were ancient and everywhere appeared dirty. I'm 5'1 but was squashed into my seat which was lumpy and not comfortable at all. Dinner smelt like a cheap microwave meal and looked very unappealing. The staff weren't particularly helpful. My husband had medication to take, it took 3 attempts after requesting water for a glass to be brought to him. ",1delta-air-lines,31/07/15,"We had an early morning departure from Boseman Montana, we were a large family and we got a very helpful Delta Airlines check in staff. The flight in itself was nice, both legs were short but I was more comfortable with the older 757-200 seats from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas but they were quite similar, since they were both short flights. There was no meal service but a choice of pretzels or nuts or biscuits and the attendants were allowing us to have more than one thing. All bags came through without issue and on time.",8continental-airlines,21/02/11,"I used Internet to purchase extra leg-room seats. It is a negatively misleading system as it leads you to believe all seats are taken when they are not. When I accessed the web page few days in advance to reserve seats it showed full plane. I paid extra for aisle which is already ridiculous only to find out after boarding the plane that it was half empty and had plenty of aisle seats available at no cost for users. In total I paid U$256 dollars for the premium seats which where everything but vpremium just because the system is set up so you only have the option of paying if you want to seat in any isle location. And this is after paying U$1330 for the round trip (Bogota-San Diego-Bogota). I believe this is an abuse against customers as we can't preview the real seat assignment for a flight on Internet just what Continental wants us to see. On top of all system was down in the segment San Diego-Houston and we were obliged to take whatever seat we could find. The employee at the boarding gate just told me my receipt of payment was not good to prove I had paid ""preferential seats"" and would not accept any argument about it. I finally got refunded (big deal!) for the trouble. Still the whole system and process stinks.",continental-airlines,21/02/11,BUF-EWR-MIA First leg was nice and smooth on a DH Q400 with nice flight attendants. Newark to Miami on a 737-900 if you wanted to watch something you had to pay for it unlike JetBlue and Air Canada where it's free. Service was nice they treated the elderly with respect having a wheelchair for each one.,7delta-air-lines,31/07/15,"The original reservation was SJCâ€“ATLâ€“BCN. Delta later modified my outbound flight and added a SEA stop between SJC and ATL, which added several hours to an already long trip, and this is the low point of my experience. SEA-ATL flight was delayed by 3 hours, and gate agents got us pizza and soft drinks, and alcohol was free during that delayed flight (delays happen, and these gate agents and FA's looked after us very well). Home-bound, ATL-SJC flight arrived 25 mins late. The other 3 flights were on time and uneventful. The check-in, gate, and onboard staff were friendly and efficient. I was surprised to be offered 3 choices for dinner on transatlantic flights, as well as a small mid-flight snack on BCNâ€“ATL flight in economy class. Flight attendants were present through the flight. Seat-back screens provided great options for individual entertainment. The extra leg-room, boarding priority, and premium drink, are well worth the cost of a Comfort+ seat. I wish seats were wider but this is true of every airline I've flown in economy class. Luggage arrived on time. I will recommend this airline for international flights. I'm a former frequent flyer of United and American airlines, who never handled their flight delays nearly as reasonably and promptly as Delta did.",8delta-air-lines,27/07/15,"Great airline! I booked with Virgin, but it turned out to be a codeshare. The IFE is considerably better than Virgin although the food wasn't as nice. I would gladly do it again.",9delta-air-lines,26/07/15,"Excellent and friendly service with a smile from FA's. The Boeing 767 is the most comfortable aircraft flown by Delta as the seating is 2-3-2.

Reasonable economy class service on B757 MAD-EWR and upgraded to F on the domestic 737 which is excellent product. IFE on the transatlantic works well and a good selection of entertainment. Continental could do a better job with announcements no reference or apology made for the 2 hour delay out of Madrid even though it was obvious that the cause was weather conditions in New York. The breakfast on the return is inadequate a croissant with jam - thats it.,8continental-airlines,09/02/11,IAH-MSY-IAH economy. Both flights on time. Very short flights so only water and refreshments on offer but crew worked very efficiently. They did not charge for the bags on the return flight and I had two bags to check in with total of about 12kg overweight!,8delta-air-lines,24/07/15,"This is my first flight with Delta. It will also be my last. The cost of the tickets was outrageous for a 2 hr flight but it was a present for my daughters so I reluctantly paid it because it had desirable departure times and no layovers. The flight was to leave at 9.35 am. They texted at 5 am to say the flight was delayed until 11.11. Just as I was walking out the door I noticed another text saying it was now going out at 12.15. As long as I had time I decided to check in online. There I was informed that my flight had been cancelled but 'don't worry, we've rebooked you on a different flight. Yes, one that leaves at 5.03 pm, lays over in Cleveland and doesn't arrive in NY until 10.00 pm.

The only thing that could be improved are the snacks in economy.",10delta-air-lines,23/07/15,I fly a lot with Delta ans was always happy but this is the first time I need to deal with customer service and I'm super disappointed. I ask a question and keep getting a standard response which you can see is taken from a general sheet 'how to answer questions' which does not fit my question at all. And I can't seem to get one contact and one email from anyone to answer. It's now going back and forth since 14 emails and 2 calls and I have not received a response as per why they did what they did. Very disappointing. ,3continental-airlines,08/02/11,Continental flight from Ixtapa Mexico to Houston cancelled Feb2011. No other flights for 4 days on Continental. Continually lied to by Continental personnel in Mexico about available alternate flights on American Airlines which we eventually booked ourselves for next morning. A feud between AA and Continental about booking software means Continental will not offer AA flights as an alternate. Told to sleep on floor in Ixtapa airport for 4 days! Offered no food vouchers no ground transport vouchers. Brutally bad service and treatment by this foul and primitive airline. Don't fly it you'll be sorry.,continental-airlines,22/01/11,MAN-EWR-MAN - ten years since I flew Continental and its not as good as I remember. Check in at Manchester was OK but a bit slow. 757 was comfortable and good seat pitch. IFE was good. Cabin crew average we were served Chicken or Beef on a 9am flight then cabin crew disappeared after drinks service. Also had to pay for alcoholic drinks which I thought was poor for long haul. Had to call cabin crew for water during flight. Seems they serve for an hour have five hours off then serve a snack 1hr before landing. Same on return leg. Food was average. No hot towels in the morning for overnight return leg Check in at EWR was quite efficient although no one spoke just directed to a check in machine and did everything else myself. Seems to be becoming a no frills airline but without the no frills price !,7continental-airlines,22/01/11,Three weeks ago we booked seats for my elderly parents to Florida from Las Vegas. We had to call an agent so they could sit together on the second leg to Ft. Myers. The only seats available together were extra legroom seats so I paid the extra cost. When we checked seat assignments today (thank goodness) we found that they had charged for extra legroom on the first leg of the trip but the seat assignment was in the economy seats and that they did not have a seat assignment on the second leg! We called Continental and they were totally unhelpful even though it was clearly their error. We ended up paying another extra 40$ so my parents can sit together because they gave us no other choice. Next time we will get them to Florida on Jet Blue. I will not use Continental again.,4delta-air-lines,21/07/15,"Got delayed from PAP, missed the connection and rerouted via MIA then ATL back to AMS. Delta agent in PAP was very helpful and put me on the flight I asked for, then Delta bumped me up to Business (Delta One). The new Delta BC with lie flat seat is really good. Window seats are even isolated (no passenger on the side). It is surrounded by the next seat which makes it a rather personal space. Having typically a low expectation of American carriers, the upgraded Delta BC is surprisingly good. Dinner is simple and well presented, service is quick and just what you need for a 7-8 hours flight. Connecting flight was slightly delayed but transit in ATL, is actually relatively easy and straight forward (from flight A to B in less than 15 min). I know it's no Asian carrier quality, but it is definitely changing my perception of US carrier and Delta seems on the right track to lift up its service. Will probably fly them again. Only negative point is arriving late in MIA there are hardly any Delta agents around (It's an AA airport!), so rebooking and hotel accommodation was tricky to figure. The Lost Luggage staff were very nice in fixing this quickly",8delta-air-lines,21/07/15,"This is not an acceptable C class. The seats feel short, the pitch is tight and you really can't recline much if you want to somewhat respectful of the person behind you. Service is basic, no cocktails, no nuts, a plate of just about edible dinner with a glass of undrinkable wine right after take off. Engine noise is deafening. Hard to believe that Delta is able to deliver credible premium service on other routes. On the plus side, the FAs were personable, the southbound itinerary is convenient and the flight ran on time.",3continental-airlines,20/01/11,NRT-EWR. Food was tasty but modest in portion. AVOD decent touch screen on-demand with a decent selection. Cocktails cost $7.00 so budget accordingly. Seat pitch is horrible - a very uncomfortable 12+ hour trip. Flight attendants a mixed bag but typical of US carriers. How US carriers manage to survive against their Asian competitors is beyond me my trip back to Asia in March is on Singapore Airlines.,4delta-air-lines,21/07/15,"We'd already flown Delta NYC to Nashville and were happy with it for shorter flights. However we were unhappy with business class Atlanta to London. It was either stiflingly hot or freezing cold. The seats were meant to lie flat and the advertising shows a woman lying on her side on the flattened seat. Interestingly she is a petite woman as anyone of average size would only be able to lie on their back when the seats are reclined as the legs are enclosed by the seat in front. My husband (who luckily likes to sleep on his back) and I swapped seats half way through as my seat was faulty and would not recline at all but I was still unable to sleep because of the seat configuration. I am a woman of average size. When my husband took it over he fiddled to see if he could get it a bit better and succeeded in releasing the leg rest which then became stuck so he spent the rest of the flight bolt upright with semi-raised legs even for landing! The two younger female flight attendants were pleasant and tried to help but the older chief stewardess for Business was curt and initially asked me what I had done to the seat! As there were no spare seats in business and no first class section she was unable to re-seat me. They tried manually fixing it and re-setting the seat, remotely, electronically but didn't return to see if it had worked - I had to call them again - and and finally (after 30 minutes of wrangling with it) the head stewardess said the magic words ""sorry about this"" (the one and only apology). Really she couldn't have cared less and when she handed out mints at the end of the flight she didn't ask how it had gone or apologise again. The food was very poor for business class (compared to BA for instance) and my husband's gluten free food was functional mainly consisting of fruit especially melon though his chicken main course was actually better than my standard meal. Breakfast consisted of granola (so sweet it was horrible) or eggs and he got a dry bread roll which was unheated (most gluten free bread is only palatable when heated) and a very poor quality gf sausage. There is such a huge range of gluten free foods now that it seems as if the airline's caterers are just not trying. Food was certainly no better than economy and fell short of Virgin Premium Economy which we flew out with. We chose Delta and the route because it had the best connections but next time we'll avoid Delta long haul.",3delta-air-lines,20/07/15,"I was warmly greeted on entering the aircraft. The service was excellent, always with a smile. However, the cabin was very warm and noisy (we were seated over the engines). My wife had a window seat while I had a middle seat. EC is worth the money. I purchased a snack box which was just enough to keep away hunger pains, but nothing to brag about. The WI FI did not function until 2 hours into flight. However, Delta is certainly better than their competitors.",8continental-airlines,14/01/11,If you enjoy flying from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States with the Fasten Seat belt sign on all of the time this is your airline. Flying from LAX to Houston was a very smooth flight and the flight attendants were efficient bring beverages by several times. After reaching cruising range (about 25 minutes) the pilot announced that he would be keeping the fasten seatbelt sign on and he never turned it off. Houston to Orlando saw major turbulence but the flight attendants stayed on their feet servicing the passengers - even when requested to sit down by the pilot. In short service is excellent but I felt like I was treated like a little kid.,6continental-airlines,14/01/11,FRA-IAH. A mixed experience. My flight had been booked through Lufthansa Continental's code share partner - as a result the check-in at Frankfurt took 30 minutes as my reservation was difficult to locate. Because Continental's plane arrived late in Frankfurt we lost our takeoff slot so that our departure was delayed by about 2.5 hours. Disingenuously a flight attendant blamed the delay on German inefficiency! Plane was only half full so I had two seats for myself - good as there was no audio in one of the seats. Food quite poor; I would honestly say barely edible. There were no hot towels or free drinks. When we arrived I had missed my connecting flight and had to stand in a long line to wait for my rebooking. Continental did offer everyone hotel and meal vouchers. Bottom line: a bearable experience. I'm not sure I would book Continental again between the US and Europe.,5continental-airlines,14/01/11,MNL-GUM-HNL-IAH-EWR flights to GUM and HNL operated by Continental Micronesia. All flights on-time friendly flight attendants and food above average. PTVs in each seats except for the MNL-GUM leg.,9delta-air-lines,19/07/15,"Delta is running a scam by calling this cabin first class. The seats, although slightly wider than in coach, do not recline, have no footrests, no phone or computer chargers. The leg room is only about 5 inches more than in coach. On my outbound flight, I had to pay for watching movies or television-any kind of television. The food is inedible. I've flown premium economy on other airlines (BA, Virgin Atlantic) that was much better than this.",1delta-air-lines,18/07/15,"This the first time I have flown on Delta in 15 years, it was a short flight about three hours an early morning departure 6.50 am we arrived ahead of schedule, a very smooth flight with a very smooth landing. Our pre-order Muslim meal was delivered and it was a very filling and flavorful vegetarian sandwich. The cabin crew were very friendly and the entertainment system was very good. The seats left a lot to desire, a business class seat on flydubai was more comfortable which is a low cost airline, Delta need to look on upgrading these seats on their new orders from Airbus.",8continental-airlines,14/01/11,EWR-MIA B737-500. Flight arrived on time clean and updated cabin. FAs did a very good job friendly and offered two rounds of drinks. Unfortunately Continental doesn't serve any complimentary food anymore on domestic flights and on this nearly 3.5 hours flight nothing else than crisps and peanuts could be purchased for breakfast. Self check-in in Newark quite inefficient as it requires a staff member to pick up the luggage in the end and takes longer than the normal procedure like in Europe.,7delta-air-lines,16/07/15,"Got to the gate 2 hours early, while changing my seat number with the Delta rep she frivolously pointed out that the plane wasn't there yet and she had no idea why. Long story short our plane was scheduled for a routine engine change on account of reaching so many miles. No one in the tower or the boarding team was aware of this. No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't. Eventually they got a a new plane and it left 2.5 hours late. I had a connection flight that I missed as a result.",1delta-air-lines,16/07/15,"The Delta staff at Savannah Airport were so disgruntled, and the weather delays only caused the gate staff more confusion. Thanks to Delta, my wife and I have to sleep in a really nasty hotel room somewhere in nowhere Detroit because they were unwilling to help put us up for the night. Their advice was to take the Sky Miles packs and spend the night in the airport. Thanks for the toothbrush. Help with my luggage? Nope! We don't recommend trying to get your luggage off whatever belt it may have been diverted too. Help with a room? Nope. Take your travel kits and be on your way! Make a phone call to try to obtain help? Nope! Person on the other end of the line can't really speak very good English. $1200 got me stuck in Detroit on my way to Kansas City, in the nastiest room ever, without mine and my wife's medication because Delta take your money, but don't provide any quality of service.",1delta-air-lines,14/07/15,"BOS-CDG, overnight flight on the 11th July and code-shared with Air France. Check-in was done via the Fly Delta app and was simple enough, paid an extra Â£50 for exit row seats which I am conflicted about. On the one hand, a good investment to have some comfort (nobody thrusting their seat into your lap on a red eye) and it's good to be able to stake a claim to those seats without relying on luck, on the other hand they were right next to the bathroom so had to deal with people standing between my seat and the wall all night and there was also nowhere to store my bag. Boarding took a little longer than expected due to a group of very excitable French children coming home from a summer camp. They were very loud, boisterous and actually downright rude but the excellent crew put a quick stop to their antics once they were on the plane. Otherwise there were no delays. The flight itself was exemplary, the staff were attentive and wonderful. The entertainment system is well-stocked and of good quality, I also loved the genuinely entertaining and funny safety video. The food was adequate, although I wasn't a fan of the meagre breakfast. No complementary alcohol on a long-haul also struck me as a little stingy. Overall I'm pleased with my experience and would recommend Delta to others.",8continental-airlines,11/01/11,Boeing 757 Newark-Manchester. Extremely poor check-in process our party of 4 persons arrived at Newark Airport 2hrs 40mins before our flight to discover the only seats available were 11F 12A 16B & 16E. Having booked our tickets together we expected to be seated at least next to our partners! Upon arrival at the terminal we were advised by Continental representatives that we should have pre-booked our seats online 24hrs prior to the flight should we have wished to be seated next to our partners? Interestingly Continental had 5 seats available together with extra leg room for an additional $109.00 each - upon enquiry I was advised that even though the flight was fully checked-in it is Continentals policy not to release these seats unless the upgrade price is paid! Boarding the aircraft I made a further request to the cabin crew to be seated next to my partner in the empty seats which was flatly refused. Only later in the flight when I asked a senior member of the cabin crew to confirm Continentals seating policy in writing was I advised that if I sat in the empty seats with my partner they would not ask me to move back! The seats in question were extra leg room emergency exit seats over the wing. I noted the emergency seating row in front was occupied by a teenager sleeping across all three seats and wondered if it was company policy to allow this? Other than my seating problems the flight was good and economy seats had plenty of leg room - just don't expect Continental staff to be helpful and assist with seating requests apparently it is company policy not to upgrade customers into empty seats even if this means you will be seated away from your partner & next to strangers.,1delta-air-lines,14/07/15,"Booked Delta via UK agent over 3 months in advance, despite early booking we had no choice of seating, sat near back of plane, Delta customer service re moving forward no response until day of flight then lip service, leaking air valve overhead and uncomfortable hard seats. Same for return flight via JFK, worse still Delta charge for checked baggage for internal flight (rip-off) as paid in full for complete journey, over a $1000 each for economy. One lady only doing everything on both sides of plane, so long waits. Ear phones useless for films. Will book elsewhere in future. ",2delta-air-lines,14/07/15,Delta suprised us-we selected this airline because of the width of the seats. We flew Sydney to Calgary via LAX and Seattle on the first leg and then coming home LAX to Sydney. Check-in staff (queues moved quickly) and customer service was excellent at all airports. Cabin staff were efficient and friendly - meals were reasonable. Entertainment system was okay - enough to keep us occupied on the long flights. Only issue we had was when one of our bags didn't arrive in Calgary - spoke to service desk and staff assured us that it would be found.

As a result I am a Platinum member. Before the United/Continental merger being Elite status was beneficial due to my upgrades to first class. However now that the merger has begun I am no longer upgraded. I am trying to figure out why it is beneficial to be Platinum/Elite on Continental these days. Very few perks - so I am considering starting to build my mileage on a different airline since being a Platinum is irrelevant to Continental since the United/CO merger. On my last trip I sat in the exit row (oh yea that's a perk-I don't have to pay to be available to save lives in the event of an emergency) with 2 other Platinum members - all of us have decided there is no longer a need to have an allegiance to Continental - no upgrades and no real perks to speak of for the allegiance of spending our money to fly this airline. I have experienced United airlines and Continental patrons are in for a very rough go of i. This complete disregard for upgrading Platinum members is just the beginning. When I was Silver and Gold I was upgraded close to 100% of the time - no longer! The United/Continental merger is a disaster for Continental passengers who enjoyed the perks and usually passable service to its elite members.,3continental-airlines,09/01/11,IAHâ€“LGA on a relatively modern 737-800. FAs were quite polite and hospitable. Even though this is a 2.5/3 hour flight and we got onboard was a dinner-snack.

Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay.  We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members. They went to the customer service desk in the private Skyclub to try to get something in the way of a comp. No satisfaction. They asked for a supervisor, who refused to even come to the service desk.

Within one click of the app, I was offered alternate flights, even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good, on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old, the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly. Entertainment options excellent, with entire seasons of my favorite TV shows. WiFi was fast, although I recommend buying the 24-hour pass on the DL website or app as it's much more expensive onboard.

We were never told that our plane would not come nor be late. We checked the website on our own and it said that they were waiting on crew to fly the plane to Houston. When a plane (not our original one) finally arrived the reason stated now was weather. The plane was loaded and we had to wait for 40 minutes for refuelling. We missed our connection to Denver by 10 minutes. We were put on standby for the next morning and finally got to Denver 12 hours late. We were not given compensation for missing our connection. Coming home not much better. When we got to Houston we were waiting at the gate noted on our tickets and listed on the monitors. All of a sudden we realized our flight was not listed any more.

Our flight was supposed to leave on June 24 at 6.05am with a connection in JFK at 9.10am. Our first flight was delayed due to the weather from the previous night.

We were told that the plane was supposed to arrive to Philly airport around 8am, making its departure to JFK at 8.40am.

Original flight scheduled depart Cleveland December 18 at 0630 with quick layover in Newark to arrive Antigua 1430. We were approximately 2 hours late for whatever reason but that wasn't the worst. We were scheduled to leave Antigua flying into Newark with a layover for night then home December 28. Due to the east coast storm our flight leaving Antigua was cancelled. Understandable and thank you for looking out for our safety. However having to pay $1400 to be on hold with Continental for 5 hours only to be told that we couldn't get on a plane departing Antigua until January 4 was unacceptable. After hearing that we would be required to spend another $3500 for accomodation in Antigua to stay another 8 days plus miss work with unpaid leave I began looking for another airline. American Airlines had opened seats so we chose to pay $1200 to fly home on December 29 rather than spend so much just waiting for Continental to be able to get us home - to our surprise Continental was selling tickets to new passengers and was able to get new passengers on a flight out the following day from when ours was cancelled but they were making us stay another 8 days to be able to use our original ticket.,delta-air-lines,09/07/15,"AUS-LAX-SEA.

It was also nice to be offered a pre flight beverage, chose white wine served in a plastic cup. The first class bulkhead seats we had were spacious. Embraer 175s do not have ovens so lunch was a cold chicken orzo salad with an appetizer and desert served all at once. Many reviews indicate that crew was either rude or inattentive but my experience wasn't like that. The drinks were kept filled during the flight, food ample and tasty and the flight attendants were upbeat and social. Boarding in LAX was a mess as the gate was in the corner and no one listens when they tell you they board by zone. Once on board a pre flight beverage was offered and after take off they served dinner. On the LAX to SEA route, Delta has partnered with Luvo as part of upgrading food service in first class.

Good thing we only had to be there for an hour. The SEA to MSP leg was on an older 767 with upgraded interior. This was the domestic version so first class was billed as business and the seats was packed in a bit tight. In any case, once again, we had a great experience. Pre-flight drinks and lunch were served. My companion and I had the cheese burger with dill potato salad, sliced cheese with fruit and a piece of raspberry cheese cake all served at once. For a lunch, it was rather hearty and was very filling. The flight attendant was a bit stuffy but she kept the drinks coming and was still attentive. Gin and tonics I had were strong so I limited myself to two and then switched to white wine. The MSP to AUS was just as pleasant. My companion had the ginger beef and I had rice with shrimp and sausage. Again a slightly stuffy attendant but nothing to get into a fuss about. Seats had ample space and the aircraft, though a bit old but was clean. One negative thing that was consistent on both the AUS-LAX-SEA and SEA-MSP-AUS flight was trash in the seat pockets.

One thing that can be said is Delta is trying to improve its service and the fact that they still offer some type of snack with your drink is better than what you get from American and United.",9delta-air-lines,02/07/15,"The flight was delayed. The boarding process was unorganized and a complete mess. We were the last ones to board and by the time we got to the entrance, my bag was automatically taken to be sent with the rest of the cargo because the flight was full and there was no space. When I check the cabins inside, I saw spaces available. The crew/staff didn't even check to see if there was space which proves how unprofessional this airline is. I paid for my ticket and only brought this bag. The crew were also unprofessional and tried to argue the fact that once the bag is checked that there was nothing for them to do and that's how things are. I guess poor food and delayed flights are not the only things that best described the service and reputation of Delta.",1delta-air-lines,02/07/15,"Many people have had negative reviews about Delta domestic flights. I had no problem with them. Compared to International airlines I've flown they don't come close. But for domestic they were superb. Great FA's, clean plane, and on time service. The seats aren't too bad, and the inflight entertainment system was pretty good. Overall a nice flight and I would choose them again if I had the chance.",8delta-air-lines,02/07/15,"I often read negative reviews of Delta. I for one have found them to be by far the best of the legacy carriers. I always find the staff helpful and pleasant, both ground and cabin staff. My recent flight had a routing DSM/MSP/JFK/LHR. On arrival at MSP I realized that my connecting flight to JFK was delayed, making the JFK connection impossible. When I explained my dilemma to a very helpful Delta employee in the Delta Club room she immediately worked on getting both me and my luggage onto the MSP/LHR service. An ontime boarding took place and I was greeted with a smile by the cabin services manager. Once airborne dinner was served (a very reasonable meal) promptly allowing the maximum time for sleep. We arrived into LHR on time and I cleared immigration and customs in a little over 30 minutes from touchdown. Delta had done for me exactly what I had asked from them, a safe, pleasant, on time journey. All the staff that I encountered during this trip were friendly and responded positively to my needs. What more could I have asked for?",9delta-air-lines,02/07/15,"San Diego to ATL on June 30. Started with the airline offering free pizza in the gate area. Boarded the 737-900 and flight crews standing throughout the plane welcomed passengers with a pleasant greeting. Economy comfort seat was great with the extra legroom, would not have wanted to be in a regular economy seat for the 4 hour flight. Took off on time, good games, movies, TV shows on the large seatback screens. Flight crew stayed busy the whole time serving snacks and drinks with 2 or 3 runs at least. Landed in Atlanta on time in spite of the not so great weather. No complaints, I would recommend!",10delta-air-lines,30/06/15,"After purchasing a ticket for my 14 year old son months in advance, I was very upset after arriving at Orlando International Airport at 4am to be told there would be am additional $150 fee for him. No where when I purchased the ticket did it tell me I'd be charged at the airport, wouldn't you think they would have charged me upfront when I paid for the ticket? If that wasn't bad enough I was told that because of the short period if time before the aircraft was due to depart, 1 hr, if he didn't make the flight there would be an additional $50 fee to get him on the next flight. We were at the airport at 3.30am, not my fault that Delta's counters don't open until 4am. It's bad enough that Delta is one of the more expensive airlines that doesn't offer free WiFi, but the agents at the counter were rude and unsympathetic.",5delta-air-lines,29/06/15,"I flew from YYC-ATL, with a stop in Salt Lake City. Check in was very slow and the person behind the desk was very rude. Our flight to Salt Lake City was 2 hours late. The seats were very uncomfortable, they were very hard and had little cushioning. The flight attendants were all rude and glared at you every time you had a request. The bathrooms were some of the filthiest I have experienced. Salt Lake City Airport was dirty and confusing, we had 55 minutes to make our connecting flight and nearly missed it because of the long time it took to change terminals. The flight from Salt Lake City to Atlanta was the same. ",1delta-air-lines,29/06/15,"We started out in Boston. Our flight was delayed an hour which was no ones fault. It was because of weather. However after we boarded the plane the isles was full of passengers with carry on's and no room in overhead bins. Flight Attendant created confusion trying to rush us in our seats. They took all 4 of my family's bags and rudely told us they would arrive in SLC our final destination. A diff Attendant handed me 2 baggage labels. I started to ask why 2 instead of 4 and ignored me and rushed up the isle. Because of delay we missed our connection. The Delta staff at JFK were horrible! Very short and acted annoyed that they had to give us directions to catch the new later connection. We arrived at the new gate to more Very rude Delta staff. Our tickets said not assigned so I stood in line at the gate to find out our new seats. When I approached the Delta staff I was told to sit down she was working on assigning seats (several passengers missed the connection). I tried to request that seats together because we were traveling with children on a 5 hour flight. She firmly told me to sit down. I felt like an idiot. They put us on the very back row with seats that partially reclined. Let's just say it was a long 5hours. After arriving in SLC 3hours later at midnight, only 3 out of the 4 bags that the rushing flight attendant took from us in the aisle arrived. Went to bag help and another employee who said he could only take a report because they didn't have record that they checked 4 bags only 2 -  Delta did give us a 1888 number to call.

On the way out they bumped us from Comfort to Economy with no notice and put me in a middle seat when we had requested 2 aisles. A nice customer service person went into our reservation and could see that we had been bumped but had no idea why. On the way back Delta had no record of our reservation but since we had proof they managed to squeeze us onto the plane after trying to get us to take one 2 hours later. Needless to say we didn't get Comfort on that leg. We were told we would get a refund on our credit card but so far nothing. Luckily we saved everything and have printed tickets, not an eticket.",3delta-air-lines,28/06/15,"On June 23rd Delta cancelled our layover flight home to Calgary. They gave 1 hour notice and could only rebook our flight 20 hrs later. Our flight was marked as mechanical problems and Delta advised customers that we had to provide our own hotel room since they ""ran out of hotels due to multiple flights cancelled that day"". After being on the phone with several agents and talking to associates at the airport we were advised to find our own hotel and submit it to Delta for possible reimbursement. The next day I spoke to a supervisor and she informed me that Delta airlines does not issue reimbursements and she could only give it in a form of a travel voucher for our next flight. I then phoned their customer care team and they told me the same thing only instead they could offer me an iTunes gift card. ",1delta-air-lines,28/06/15,Aircraft a bit old but cabin crew were friendly and extremely helpful. A pleasant trip following a long haul from Sydney. The pre-flight safety brief was hilarious and a great attention grabber. Wish more airlines were as imaginative. Had heard some differing views about this airline but we were very pleasantly surprised.,8delta-air-lines,26/06/15,"DCA-MSP flight went smoothly. Smooth connection at MSP. MSP-NRT flight has many pros and cons. The seat was very comforatable compared to other airlines combined with a satisfactory IFE. The food could be much much better. I had chicken teriyaki for my supper and that was acceptable, but breakfast was horrible. The appearance was bad enough, the egg looking like a wet sponge without any air pockets and the sausage was burnt. But the taste was even worse. The fruit was acceptable. To end on a good note, the arrival at NRT went very well and smoothly.",4delta-air-lines,25/06/15,"I made a reservation with Delta airlines in April 2015 for travel in July. I am a single father traveling with two small children (ages 6 and 10) and booked far in advance and in First class so that I could sit with my children. I was informed 24 hours ago that our seats had been changed and that I would not be seated with my children. When I called Delta to inquire (and after waiting more than 2 hours to speak to a representative) I was told there was nothing that they could do and that my children would have to sit by themselves. Despite the obvious safety concerns, there is no way that I can assist my children with beverages or bathroom breaks if needed. If you are a single parent, do not fly Delta. Not family friendly.",1delta-air-lines,22/06/15,"Had a pretty good experience with Delta. Had 5 persons in my party, 2 of which with lap children. We were in basic economy on the way to Tampa.

More leg room, better snacks and free alcohol. The flight crew was cheery and up beat making the flight easier.",7delta-air-lines,19/06/15,"Left Minneapolis RT to San Jose in June. First Class RT paid ticket. On the flight out we were served a full breakfast. The food was actually not bad. Flight attendant was very attentive and quiet busy checking on all passengers. Did not disappear after the meal service. The flight back to Minneapolis was also excellent. Boarding was orderly in both directions. Lunch was a large salad. However, only one choice. It was a Salmon Salad. Quite a few of passengers turned it down, including me. I was surprised there were not at least 2 choices. Once again First class FA was great. Waiting to board in both directions, the checked baggage and the number of carry on is being abused. in both directions. People were checking bags that were huge. Not sure how they got past TSA. Gate Agents need to enforce bag sizes and the number of bags people try to drag on.",9delta-air-lines,18/06/15,"I took my second trip with Delta and I must say I was definitely not disappointed. I flew with Delta last year and felt there was no need to change to a different airline. I flew from Indy to Phoenix via Minneapolis. The crews both at the gate and during the flight were professional and respectful.  The big two thumbs I want to give is on my luggage in Phoenix. No sooner had I walked off the plane and down to the baggage claim carousel was I greeted by my bag arriving. Only thing I found average was the seat comfort, but granted I have never really cared about seat comfort.",10delta-air-lines,17/06/15,"For a short haul flight like this one (7-8 hours each way), I try and save money by not booking business class, rather ""economy comfort"" on Delta. As usual, the service is perfunctory, the food not bad in and out of Narita, the seat fairly comfortable, and the entertainment of good quality with lots of choices. No drama on either flight. My only complaint that has never been addressed properly with Delta over the years is the horrible state of the lavatories. They are always left to fester for entire flights. I have never once seen an FA go in one to clean one. Delta is not ""special"" compared to other international carriers, but it's adequate and they have treated me well in the Skymiles program so far.",8delta-air-lines,14/06/15,"Check in procedure was ok but slow.

Unable to check in online, then checked in at airport but without assigned seat. Result: sitting separate from my boyfriend while I am afraid to fly. At check in counter not very helpful, lady (though friendly) said she couldn't do anything and that we had to wait until boarding. At gate itself they're trying to get us to sit next to each other but difficulties since flight is fully booked. Not impressed with customer service and we were not informed by email, when booking, or at check-in that there were paid seats as an option and that the free seats were given away and that is why we were assigned no seat number. ",3delta-air-lines,06/06/15,Delta will always be my first choice across the Atlantic and I have found them to be always even better than either BA or Virgin (who have themselves always provided excellent service). My latest flights were no exception. This is the second time I've flown from Heathrow to LAX in four months and both times the service has been great. Without doubt the friendliest cabin crew I have met the in-flight entertainment was good the food was okay and plentiful and the drinks and snacks kept coming. My first choice every time and whilst not the cheapest carrier it's certainly been the most reliable and pleasant to fly with.,10delta-air-lines,06/06/15,5/28/15 PVD-ATL-CAE 6/1/15 CAE-ATL-PVD. Flight was on time departing PVD. Had booked Economy+ and was lucky enough to have an empty middle seat. Got a free cocktail in Economy+. Unfortunately passengers ignore the signs that say bin space over those seats is reserved for Economy+ because when I boarded I had to use a bin 4 rows back which is annoying when deplaning. Got delayed about 25 minutes by weather before landing at ATL. Had to go straight to the gate for the next flight. Staff was very pleasant. ATL to CAE is less than 30 mins so there is no beverage service. Arrived at CAE about 50 mins before my scheduled flight from CAE to LGA. Got a text saying it was delayed 45 mins. I knew I would never make the connection to BOS. There was a flight boarding to ATL and I asked if they could get me there faster. They said they couldn't get me to BOS earlier but they could get me to PVD. They gave me a seat (and happily changed it when I asked for an aisle). No beverage service. CAE to ATL is killer at 7am! No Starbucks in Terminal C at ATL. Flight to PVD arrived 20 mins early and flight attendants were very pleasant.,10delta-air-lines,04/06/15,JFK to LAX. We were apprehensive about flying Delta but got a good price on this mid afternoon flight. Bought Delta comfort to see if this improved the experience. Flight left on time.

Overall an ok experience.,5delta-air-lines,01/06/15,$600 for the less than 2 hour flight 1377 (PHL-RDW) booked 2 weeks in advance was daylight robbery. The 30 minute line at the baggage drop caused entirely by staff shortage added insult to injury. But never mind the flight was delayed by over an hour anyway.,3delta-air-lines,01/06/15,I have chosen Delta for years because of it was the best one but lately it's service has been so terrible that I will never fly with them again. Twice now I have flown out of Detroit and there have been problems that have delayed the flight to our next location (I understand that problems happen) but while we were on our flight I was very thirsty and asked the stewardess for a glass of water and she said the cart would be by shortly - the cart skipped our whole section and when I tried to stop the flight attendant again I was ignored - I didn't see the attendants for the rest of the flight. When we arrived at Atlanta to switch to our next flight we had missed our flight. The first time no one would help me - I must have talked to at least 10 people before finding someone that rudely told me to go to a certain gate and wait and that I might make it onto that flight. This time I went to the gate and they told us the plane had just left (the plane was not suppose to leave Atlanta until 12.50 I was at the gate at 12.40) and when I asked where do I go to get another flight I was ignored and they walked away. I then went to the information and was told to go to a gate that had no one at it - no one! I then went back and was rudely sent to another gate where I was told they didn't know if they had a seat available for me. After an hour I was able to get a flight home. I could not believe the rudeness that I was treated with.,delta-air-lines,31/05/15,My wife and I were booked on Delta flight 7 leaving Dubai at 9.45 pm. There was a mechanical problem with the plane these things happen. We were advised to go wait in a nearby Business Class lounge and wait for an announcement which never occurred. I walked back to the gate only to then discover that the flight had been cancelled and no announcement had been made the gate agent even admitted this. The rebooking was a nightmare we finally left Dubai two days later and had to endure the same rude gate agents who were more concerned with talking on their cell phones and playing around than taking care of the customers. Most of the agents did not speak even a small amount of English they were not organized and clearly not professionals. I have flown with Delta for over 11 years this is the worst experience I have ever had.,1delta-air-lines,31/05/15,Worst airline I have ever flown. We are frequent flyers and this was a trip from hell. We will never fly Delta again. We were traveling from LAX to Dublin with a change of planes in N.Y. We sat in the plane on the ground for 2 hours at L.A.X. because of mechanical problems. Because of this we missed our connection to Dublin so had to spend the night in N.Y. From N.Y. They flew us to Atlanta the next day. Again there was airplane problems. We waited for two hours at the airport for them to find a plane that worked. It took us two days to get to Dublin. On the way home we flew from Dublin to N.Y. again sat on ground for 2 hours and 15 minutes on the Tarmac. Once we arrived back at LAX waited another hour in baggage claim only to find that our one bag was put on another flight.,delta-air-lines,29/05/15,We booked first class seating for the midnight to dawn flight from LAX (USA) to (SJO) San Jose Costa Rica so we would have lay flat seats and a good LAX lounge to use while we waited for our midnight flight. The seats did not lay flat. Delta cabin staff explained that lay flat seats are only available on First Class international flights over water. Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket. There was no inflight magazine for my seat. Upon requesting one I was handed a creased and folded one by a surly female cabin attendant. The Delta lounge in LAX was dirty and unkempt. Complementary drinks were limited to Bud Beer or a house white/red - anything else had to be paid for. Food was mixed nuts or pretzels. Undoubtedly the second worst flight I had the displeasure to undertake. The worst flight was the return from SJO to LAX. It compromised all the above plus the following. Upon taking our seat we were offered a glass of sparkling wine. Take off was delayed for 40min while a seat was repaired. We asked for a second glass of wine to while away the tarmac delay and was told that they only had one bottle for the flight and they had already used it. Classy eh? On arrival at LAX our priority First Class luggage was one of the last off - so much for the priority tag. I can only wonder how well Delta aircraft are maintained if this is their penny pinching standard in First Class. My view is that one should avoid Delta at all costs.,2delta-air-lines,29/05/15,LAX-SJO DL1388 1 May 2015. SJO-LAX DL1396 11 May 2015.

Obviously Delta executives do not regard a 5 hour overnight flight to another country as an international flight even though some of it was across the Pacific Ocean. The safety briefing was a screen based childish cartoon. Flight safety is serious business. A safety briefing by a cabin attendant reinforces that. Downplay it with a cartoon gives the impression that its all one big joke. The First Class cabin was old and tired. There was an unfinished soft drink bottle in my seat pocket.

No IFE on the inbound flights but because I had a tablet I just connected to their wifi (without paying) and go to Delta Studio allowing me to stream movies for free. On the return flight the B737-800 was newly refurbished and had IFE with some good choice of videos. Snacks (to be purchased) are as usual awful.

No delays on all segments.,7delta-air-lines,28/05/15,Looked forward to Delta Comfort on recent flight from DFW to Minn. Delta changed planes so there was no Delta Comfort. I was relegated to a window seat. Delta could not get their act together on reassigning seats so the boarding process was terribly slow and disorganized. I fly Delta to Minn because I have to not because I want to. I don't think American's customer service or organization is great but it's better than this. If you can use another airline.,3delta-air-lines,25/05/15,Honolulu - Narita Business. A very pleasant experience.

Flight similar to the ones I took on 5/4/15. Economy comfort is better than economy but not by much. Its main advantage is priority boarding which allows me to avoid the inevitable rush and scramble for overhead bin space. Rated food as 1 because I didn't buy any entertainment also as 1 because there wasn't any. I don't look forward to flying with Delta even in economy comfort.,6delta-air-lines,20/05/15,5/4/15 MSP-PHL MD 90. Rated food as a 1 because the inflight offerings do not appeal to me. When I've tried to purchase food items on previous flights the FAs have run out of the items I would have ordered. So I brought my own sandwich. I also brought my own beverage because FAs on a previous flight refused to sell me a bottle of wine for dinner told me to wait for the beverage cart's second round. Rated entertainment as 1 because there was none. The FAs were competent the aircraft clean and on time.,6delta-air-lines,20/05/15,5/4/15 SMF-MSP Airbus A320 Economy Comfort legroom adequate service competent. Complaint: Delta does not post economy comfort fares on its website but as separate upgrades for each flight segment. Value for money rated at 1 because I traveled on an award ticket entertainment rated as 1 because the flight didn't have any. Legroom was slightly better than on previous Economy Comfort flights but recline was still minimal. Food for purchase was unappealing but the complimentary snacks and beverages were acceptable. I wouldn't recommend Delta because it seems to focus more on nickel and diming its passengers than in providing quality service.,6delta-air-lines,20/05/15,A simple flight from BWI to NYC turned into a 3 hour wait on flight 3371. With very little communication between the staff/pilot and the passengers. On a bright sunny day in MD and only mild rain and overcast in NYC the pilot said it was weather related. After waiting for the plane to arrive for 2.5 hours. When we get on the flight we had to wait another 30 minutes on the plane for more ridiculous reasons - they claim the baggage door was not shut properly. So someone comes to shut it and then we go out to runway. Then we have to wait another 13 minutes. Not able to rebook me for reasons that were also very vague. The flight was overpriced and didn't event accomplish it's intended purpose to get people where they need to be on time. As a business traveller this is absolutely unacceptable. I cannot get business done if I can't get to my destination.,delta-air-lines,20/05/15,5/9/15 SLC-SMF Airbus A320. My spouse let me sit in her first class seat. It was a disappointment: legroom not much better than Economy Comfort although the seat was wider and had more recline. The food was also disappointing same snacks as the ones given to Economy Comfort passengers. On the positive side the FA brought me a glass of wine when requested unlike my main cabin experiences in which FAs will not bring me a small bottle for wine (even if purchased) until the beverage cart makes its rounds. I didn't pay for this first class travel but if I had I would have been even more disappointed. My trip satisfaction is less than it was for my Economy Comfort flights because first class failed to meet my expectations. I rated entertainment as 1 because there wasn't any.,2delta-air-lines,20/05/15,LAX-JFK-KEF return Comfort + on all four segments. The Sky Priority boarding and extra legroom were a real plus but the DL Comfort + seating does not compare to BA Premium Economy. The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX. The ancient 767 on the final JFK-LAX leg was too warm had poor ventilation and the VOD lacked the live Dish TV option. Boarding for JFK-LAX was chaotic.,7delta-air-lines,18/05/15,Flew DL1162 LAX-JFK on 05/11. We were booked on this flight after missing connecting QF flight from MEL. I was seated in an aisle seat next to the emergency exit plenty of legroom possibly the most comfortable seat I've been on (having only flown economy). The snacks and drinks were fine the cabin crew were attentive. However it is simply wrong that you cannot use the entertainment system during take-off and landing. Overall quite average service nothing particularly bad however I still would prefer QF if I had the choice.,5delta-air-lines,12/05/15,On 28 April 2015 my friend and I travelled from Fort Lauderdale Florida to Atlanta Georgia for our connecting flight to Manchester England UK. Due to storms in Florida our flight was delayed by an hour. Despite the pilot's best efforts we arrived at Atlanta B24 35 mins before our flight to England was due to take off. After running as fast as we could we arrived at the check-in desk 10 mins before the Virgin plane was due to depart (the airline was aware of the Florida delay). Despite the best efforts of all the personnel on duty they were unable to get us on the plane. Nevertheless not only did the staff stay with us to locate our baggage at B24 but tried and succeeded to get us on another plane to depart that night. Staff not only located our baggage but ensured it would be put on the new flight. To the lady who got us two seats on the Delta flight to Manchester via Amsterdam and the staff member accompanied us to E30 to make sure we were checked in and on our way home.,9delta-air-lines,02/05/15,Milwaukee WI to Atlanta GA - Panama City FL return.

We were met at every plane with the wheelchair and a very courteous staff member.,8delta-air-lines,26/04/15,Great service on this fight. YYZ-LGA LGA-ATL. Snack choices were nuts cookies or pretzels and a drink. On time flight both ways.,10delta-air-lines,23/04/15,Travelled from DUB-ATL-RSW on 22nd April 2015. Very good service from any Delta employee either check in or flight crew we had contact with. My wife and myself travel from DUB 3 or 4 times a year always with Delta to enjoy the Florida sunshine. We do on occasions treat ourselves to a trip up front and to a degree we are looking forward to the trip already booked for the end of Sept when we are using some of my wife's miles to upgrade. Everybody today worked well and provided a very good service on both flights and I would have no problem at all about saying that the Delta workers represented their company very well.,10delta-air-lines,22/04/15,"We flew to Phoenix from Montreal with a Detroit connection and cannot believe what is passing for a decent airline experience in the US these days (the return on American Airlines was just as bad). The least passengers should expect from an airline is a seat that is not torn and filthy a plane that leaves on time and that arrives on one piece. Fine the flight did those things but are we supposed to be impressed? The plane was packed and tiny. No room for hand luggage for many passengers. Old plane - I mean really old. No movies or Ipads. Somewhat encouraged by the Wifi on board until we discovered you had to pay for it and it did not work well anyway. Business class looked like economy class five to seven years ago. Seats were small and do not get me started on the pitch. Dilapidated and depressing two other words starting with ""D"". Delta needs a makeover. I have new insight into why Air Canada is rated the best airline in North America. The bar is so very low.",3delta-air-lines,20/04/15,Travelled from London Heathrow to Los Angeles in early April 2015. From the time of check-in the Delta staff were nothing but extremely helpful and obliging making the process super quick and easy. The flight itself was fantastic - unlimited drinks/alcohol (I had three very generous servings of red wine) and ample food. Hot towels were handed out at the beginning and end of the service while two meals were served during the 11-hour flight. If we required more drinks or food the staff were more than happy to oblige. The in-flight entertainment was also top notch - wonderfully wide selection of television shows and films. All in all a very pleasant experience - can't say the same for the subsequent LA > Vegas leg of the journey so will be sticking with Delta for intercontinental flights!,9delta-air-lines,20/04/15,DL 449 BOG-JFK business class. Awful Avianca lounge in BOG crowded and rude staffed. The aircraft was a 1980- vintage B757 unbelievable! Flight left 35 minutes late with no explanations. Although skypriority boarding was smooth the welcome sparkling wine was warm. No peanuts not even a napkin. Refills were offered by the rather friendly and respectful crew. Nice two course dinner with fair wine offer. Overall a nice experience which was ruined on the return JFK-BOG leg.,7delta-air-lines,20/04/15,Return flight JFK-BOG business class. Awful dirty DL Skyclub at terminal 4 wherein all drinks and food have to be paid for except for mediocre house wines warm domestic beers and yes popcorn. Flight left 30 minutes late. Rude disinterested crew barely greeted the boarding passengers. Same ancient 757 with fairly comfortable lie flat seating. Were served an awful breakfast at midnight instead of dinner with no explanations. Then crew gathered in the front galley screaming and laughing bothering paying J class passengers that were trying to sleep. One of the pilots occupied seat 1A beside me without even saying hello. Unbelievable. Finally the crew forgot customs forms to entry BOG they didn't even knew they existed so we had to get them upon arrival. Luggage arrived one hour after arrival. Never again.,1delta-air-lines,19/04/15,Shanghai Pudong-Tokyo Narita on old B767-300ER return on A330-300 both on time check-in/boarding very efficient lounge at Pudong Airport run by China Eastern which is always bad nothing to eat and over-crowded. Inflight food and drinks good considering it's a 2hr regional flight crew very polite and friendly. AVOD is amazing with lots latest movies.,8delta-air-lines,14/04/15,First time with Delta and very pleased with the result. Seat on the 767 worked fine if slowly and the flat bed was comfortable. This was enhanced by the excellent Westin pillow and duvet. The most comfortable pillow of any airline I have flown with. Food was excellent well presented and flavourful. Cabin crew were pleasant attentive and polite. The only bad thing I can report was the IFE system. It took five or maybe six attempts to make it work and the selection of movies was extremely limited. The small screen was not of great quality either. Flight was on time.,8delta-air-lines,14/04/15,I flew Business on an international flight aboard 767-300. The experience in the Business class is probably one of the worst due to the layout of the cabin. The Galley is in the front and in order for the flight attendants to service the plane down to the middle of the standard economy class they must go through the Business class cabin to reach the areas to the back. On other airlines such as ANA they have an extra Galley behind the Business and Premium Economy class seats so that there may be a separation in service and noise. The design of the seating arrangement in the Business class is much tighter in the Delta with its bulky boxy full-flat system that the flight attendants' hard foot steps with their high-heels can be felt bouncing through the walls of the full-flat system. What kind of flooring did they use in the aisle? Why do the horrible footsteps and cart sounds transmit so much to the boxy seat system? I could not rest quietly or comfortably as the massive loud obnoxious footsteps of passengers and flight attendants alike can be felt all throughout the flight. No courtesy there obviously no company policy there obviously to make the flight attendants wear something more quiet on their feet or to be more considerate when running down the aisle! The temperature control of the full-flat system is lacking. The seats themselves feel fine but they become very hot after a while and there is no air around the seat or your feet so there is no way to cool down. The attitude of the flight attendants is about what you would expect from a classless American transport company fairly lacking in manners and they treat you as if you're on a flying bus (as they have always done). The Flight Safety video is a joke as they intended it to be but it certainly doesn't make anybody feel safe as nobody remembers the actual safety bits but remembers the comedy bits! A total waste of time and energy and most certainly conveys what I said earlier about the attitude of the airline. It feels like a cheap low-class flying commuter bus service and they'll treat you like that.,2delta-air-lines,14/04/15,"My wife and I returned to Boston on Saturday from my son's wedding in New Orleans. I had booked Delta to and from New Orleans changing at Atlanta. On the way down a problem emerged. My wife generally signs everything Patti instead of Patricia. I had made the reservation for her for Patti as I always do. A TSA guy decided to make an issue of the difference between Patti (on the boarding pass) and Patricia (on her license) and sent her back to the Delta counter. They changed the boarding pass and all was well. We reached the airport in plenty of time Saturday morning in NO and tried to get everything done at curbside check-in. I got my boarding pass but the machine refused to give out hers. The guy checked the bag and turned us over to a Delta guy walking the floor inside. He put us in a large line for ""special problems."" Since at this time there was about an hour before boarding we weren't worried. However Delta was woefully understaffed the line moved with glacial speed. With about 20 minutes to departure my wife told me to board to make sure at least one of us got home and I did. Meanwhile I was in touch with my wife via cell she had finally reached the end of the line. They told her she was too late to make the plane. They told her she would be on the next flight to Atlanta and there was 20 minutes between its landing and our Boston flight departing so she might make it. Her seat of course had been given away. It turned out the name confusion was an issue again. I will never fly Delta again if I can possibly avoid it.",delta-air-lines,12/04/15,JFK-NRT-SIN And back. Sky club at JFK was nice but wish food didn't need to be paid for. First flight was largely uneventful the seats were what I expected food was nothing special and IFE was great. The lounge in NRT though needs an upgrade in terms of F&B. A lot of other airlines have more than just small bowls of whatever they're serving. (At least there were showers). NRT-SIN was normal and like the previous flight. The return was similar aside from the fact that Delta actually listened to customer feedback and pushed the departure time from 6 to 7am. Not too thrilled that the arrival into JFK is when a bunch of others come in and result in a 2 hour wait at immigration.,7delta-air-lines,12/04/15,I arrived at the airport around 8.50 for a 10.15 flight. I was on military orders. They delayed my flight and/or switched my flight 10 times. Put me on Standby on 3 different flights. They gave no preference or concern. I called to talk to customer service and they did nothing. During my flight from Jacksonville to Atlanta they didn't even serve food or drinks because they said they ran out of time. I could have driven from Jacksonville to Norfolk faster. I was in the airport for 14 hours. That is unacceptable and the staff won't tell you if you made standby or not so you have to wait there instead of getting food or leave the area.,delta-air-lines,12/04/15,JFK to LHR possibly the worst flight and service I have experienced. The cabin crew made it clear that passengers were especially economy were a real inconvenience - the customer service was awful food and beverages dumped on trays and very little interest in the passengers. There was no excuse everyone was polite to the cabin staff and if anything had kicked off it would have been as a result of their rudeness and failure to pay attention. Economy doesn't mean cheap had I been travelling alone I would have travel business but as I was with a group I stayed with them. Compared to Virgin Atlantic and BA Delta is a waste of money will always change the flight or choose another carrier in future once was too much.,1delta-air-lines,12/04/15,Flew DL from Brussels to Sacramento CA. It turned out to be a really good trip. All flights were on time and connections went smooth. Both ground and inflight staff were very professional and friendly. The special meal I ordered was fine. I would definitely recommend this airline!,8delta-air-lines,12/04/15,I flew from BNA-ATL-EYW round trip for spring break. Full planes no upgrades available. Its nice to take a full size plane into Key West. All four flight segments were nice clean comfortable. Seat was tight but its coach and no flight was over 1.5 hours. Flight attendants were competent and pleasant on all legs. Loved the gate crew at Key West campy and competent. Made everyone laugh. Easiest way to Key West in my opinion. It wasn't cheap and my Frequent Flyer miles were no good for a First Class upgrade but I didn't mind a single bit.,8delta-air-lines,06/04/15,LHR-JFK 29th March 2015 - B767-400 - Boarding was slow at Heathrow but very organised we had a basic economy seat on our outbound sector and I've never seen Seats so small my partner is 6ft 6 and could not fit in the seats and although everyone is entitled to someone even had the audacity to recline their seat in front of him knowing he couldn't fit. Flight was full but the services offered were very good and efficient we were offered a complimentary meal and a snack during the flight along with beverages. Flight attendants were very nice and polite however a couple of them were miserable and rude and towards the end of flight they lost interest and almost threw the coffee at us. We were happy to get off the flight it was very uncomfortable. JFK-LHR B767-300 - Our inbound sector was much better we paid to upgrade into economy comfort with exits seats which also meant priority boarding. Seats were not the greatest but legroom was huge and better for my partner. Flight was a night flight and it was very quiet and almost empty flight attendants polite and services offered again were very good. Both aircraft each way were ageing but at least they got us to our destination. I noticed Call bells were not answered and were left for hours. In flight entertainment was good new films offered for free along with games and TV shows. I would recommend Delta but next time would definitely pay to upgrade both ways due to the seat pitch in basic economy.,8delta-air-lines,06/04/15,Economy Nice CÃ´te d'Azur to JFK 4th April 2015. Flight was about an hour delayed to leave Nice airport but Delta gave all passengers complimentary pizza and drinks as an apology for the wait (even though I had received an email about the delay several hours before). Boarding took forever as the mandatory checks have become very long and tedious (my carry on bags were opened for a second time right before I boarded the plane although this was randomized from what I understand). The plane floors and loos were quite dirty as if a thorough cleaning had not been done in a while. Very limited food choices although staff helpful with snacks. Other than above (oh and the horrendous immigration queues at JFK) everything else was great.,9delta-air-lines,28/03/15,"DL28 Atlanta-Heathrow 16/3/15. Party of 4. Paid $99 upgrade to premium economy (drinks and seating package). We were offered 2 drinks and noticed all economy passengers were offered same FOC. There was little or no discernible difference between our seats and other seats in economy cabin. We were given the wrong food which was awful. The video equipment failed and it took almost 1 hr. to effect a reset. Hostess never did respond to call had to walk up the plane to report video and food issues. Generally a ""could not be bothered"" attitude.",1delta-air-lines,28/03/15,Flew Business from BOS to AMS in late February. The newly configured Business cabin on the A330 is now my favorite on any airline or any plane. Very comfortable seat/lie flat bed and personal space. I was traveling with my husband and unlike many other configurations the two middle seats allow two passengers traveling together to actually be together. The food and wine are excellent as usual and the IFE is industry leading. Let me not forget to praise the huge monitor for the IFE. Much larger than other airline's. Delta Business is my preferred airline for international travel. The only areas where they fall a bit short are in the crew professionalism at times. For instance on this flight I was never referred to by name which is just lazy. I just have one other comment and that is I wish they didn't serve a bag of spiced nuts with the first cocktail and instead served something like hot nuts or chips in a dish instead of a bag. Just a little thing but the only are a that isn't top-notch.,9delta-air-lines,26/03/15,BOS-LAX 738. Boarding was fairly efficient. They boarded basically by two zones after all the preferred boarding for the first/frequent flyer/credit card holders etc. I'm not a fan of the zones as you're always stuck behind someone but at least they turned back people who tried boarding out of their group. They advertise the flight with seatback entertainment on their site but I noticed after booking they often switch to a plane with dropdown monitors. On this flight it switched to an aircraft with dropdowns which actually was not as bad as I thought but not thrilled with how they do that. The overhead monitor showed the latest 'Hunger Games' movie and then the 'Minions' movie which is as good as I would have got with Live TV on the seatbacks. The monitors seem to be every 3/4 rows. They gave nuts/pretzels out twice during the flight which is not bad for legacy carrier and drinks twice. Price was comparable/just below other offerings and at the most convenient times. It arrived early to LAX and had no wait on takeoff due to mid-morning time slot. Middle seat of my row was empty with aided in comfort. 8/10.,8delta-air-lines,25/03/15,"Flying from LaGuardia to Dallas the flight was cancelled without the airline letting us know then they had no flights for 10 hours from NYC to Dallas. Really? Not even a connection out of their home town of Atlanta. No apologies no sympathy just the typical ""welcome to New York"" chuckle. You would think the airline could have tried to help my family and me for at least 10 minutes without a sarcastic ""sorry but it could be worse!""",delta-air-lines,25/03/15,Generally I like Delta airlines however they need to have the staff designing connection between small and large airports try to make those flights when the weather isn't perfect. I have had numerous bad experiences connecting between Madison WI and Detroit MI on my way to Boston. I have had to run from one end of DTW to the other end change terminals i.e. run from B to A. I am a Medallion level passenger. Delta needs to work with the Detroit Metro Airport to get connecting flights closer together.,5delta-air-lines,23/03/15,I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly. I will never fly Delta again as long as they operate this way.,2delta-air-lines,20/03/15,Never again with Delta. My wife and I experienced delays after delays yesterday March 18 at JFK after our flight to Montreal got delayed several times. It took us from 11.30 to 00.30 the next day to get from Fort Lauderdale to Montreal with a connection at JFK.,delta-air-lines,20/03/15,6th April KL6149 Schiphol to JFK. Very poor service on a transatlantic flight. Plane was loaded when staff knew there was a technical problem which resulted in us being sat on the tarmac for 2 hours. Inflight entertainment was poor (some of it was chargeable). Food provided was poor quality and tasteless. Staff were not very pleasant or personable. This was a very poor experience which I will not be repeating!,delta-air-lines,19/03/15,I will never book with them again. I am currently stranded in Seattle with my 3 children who I had booked to fly as unaccompanied minors. We called to book their flights and were assured that everything was in order. After a 5 hour drive to the airport today we were told that they could not go on their flight because it was the last flight of the day out of their connecting city. Even after calling twice to confirm everything before we left! We were offered nothing more than an insincere apology. It's like they didn't even care. What pathetic customer service. Will never fly with this airline.,delta-air-lines,17/03/15,I was aboard a 767 from MSP to LAS (economy class) and a 757 from LAS to MSP (first class). Flight attendants were friendly and planes were clean and seemed well maintained. On time departures with easy and smooth landings and take offs.,9delta-air-lines,17/03/15,YWG-MSP-PHX. Flew YWG-MSP on a CRJ-900. I was on the 1 seat side rather than the 2 seat side so I had both a window and an aisle seat. Flight attendant was friendly and frequently came by with snacks and refills. MSP-PHX was on an A320. A little disappointing that the A320's don't have seatback TV's seat was comfortable and on par with every other airlines First Class on A320's. Flight attendant was also friendly and efficient. Food was fine (I had soup sandwich and chips). Same as the first flight she was came by frequently with snacks and refills. For some reason on the YWG-PHX route Delta's First Class is only $75 more than Economy. Delta is now my preferred airline out of Winnipeg and in my opinion is better than Westjet which I flew home.,8delta-air-lines,17/03/15,"Flew DC to Albuquerque with connection through Atlanta. Arrived in Atlanta followed display boards for departing gate. Got to the gate 90 minutes before departure confirmed gate location was correct and sat down. Sat 10' from the counter the whole time and looked out the window. Thought it was strange the plane hadn't arrived yet and they hadn't made any announcements. Gate Agents were busy issuing Delta Dollars to a bunch of passengers from last flight so the area was very busy. Turned around and happened to see on the reader board along the wall (not behind the gate) that there was a gate change. No announcement was ever made in that terminal that the gate had changed and there was no announcement with out names to go to the gate. It was moved from B28 to B3 literally as far apart as you could get from each other. By the time we got to B3 the door had closed. We found a ""red coat"" employee across the hall. She made it seem like we were idiots and there would have been announcements made. She put us on Stand By from Atlanta to Salt Lake City we had 3 shots to get on one of the flights. However it is spring break and Salt Lake is a huge destination point all flights were oversold and had 30+ people on standby for each flight. In the hustle to get from one location to the other and going to 3 different terminals we saw numerous reader boards that indicated gate changes and while sitting in those 3 different terminals we never heard one announcement for any gate change on a Delta flight. We finally had to buy tickets on Southwest so we could get home. While sitting in their terminal we heard announcements for gate changes over and over and they were paging passengers to check in at the gate. I will never fly Delta again.",delta-air-lines,17/03/15,CDG to ORD March 3 and one week later back both flights leaved on time plenty of food decent inflight entertainment with a great choice of international movies would fly them again.,9delta-air-lines,09/03/15,"This is my first experience flying with Delta and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was canceled over 20 hours in advance and I was automatically reassigned to a flight departing 13 hours later. While I appreciate a seat at some point their were 6 flights earlier that I could have been placed on and I was not given a choice. I called Delta and had an associate inform me that I was ""not a priority"" because other flights before mine had been canceled. She also told me my departure weather was the issue she was incorrect. She did absolutely nothing to help me on the phone and was unapologetic. My co-workers on other airlines all departed mostly on time and make it to the same destination I was heading just fine while Delta continued to tell me the weather was not ok. I arrived at the airport at 5am and proceeded to sit in standby flight after flight. As I sit and wait for these flights they are all overbooked by at least 15 seats and I have had several agents act that I am an annoyance when I asked to be put on standby. The attitudes of the agents are generally distasteful and rude. They are treating us as if we are creating the issues and I have offered no apologies on behalf of anyone.",delta-air-lines,09/03/15,On March 1 2015 my flight from Phoenix to JFK (1247) was delayed due to icy conditions in New York. My 2pm flight finally took off at 4pm. When we were an hour from our destination the pilot informed us that management was diverting our plane to Detroit. We were told that agents would be waiting for us at the arrival gate and would answer all our questions. The agents turned out to be one very disinterested agent who was talking on his cell phone when we arrived and only told us where to go for re-ticketing when prodded. He sent us to gate A53 that already had a line of 150 people when those of us in the back of our plane got there. There was a lone agent to answer all our questions and re-book each person individually. After 1 hour in line we hadn't moved at all. There were no announcements no accommodations no compassion or concern for your customers. No food no pillows no answers! Many of us had family back at JFK waiting for us and we had no information to give. That none of the 1200 people that were diverted lost it is a testament to OUR understanding and patience. Clearly the understanding was one-sided. No one blamed the inconvenience on the airline after all weather happens. What we objected to was the total ineptitude and lack of compassion of the Delta personnel. Eventually a fellow came around with one slice of pizza but I found out about that by roaming the gates looking for information. Most of us slept on the floor as there were no cots or sleeping bags given as an option. It is disappointing that Delta couldn't do better. Eventually some of us received a $100 voucher by insisting on some compensation for our discomfort. I don't imagine I will make much use of it as Delta will be a last choice of airline for me.,delta-air-lines,09/03/15,Delta recently on a finally two class plane from YWG-MSP (CRJ-900) I believe. Total trip was YWG-MSP-LAS. I despise the United ERJ-145's and similar small product that was on international routes from YWG previously. Thank you to Delta for slightly upgrading the size of your planes out to MSP. Solid 757-300 economy plus to Las Vegas. Solid crew everything was nice and smooth. The 757 had been refurbished had a great AVOD system. Flights on time crew very friendly. I cannot ask for more on this route. It seems to me Delta is making a large effort to improve their customer service and technology and overall experience. It is working wonders it is amazing how far ahead Delta is of United (my other carrier to Las Vegas through DEN). My preferred US carrier.,9delta-air-lines,04/03/15,Superb flight very helpful cabin crew who couldn't do enough for the passengers and were very friendly. Food good and plentiful as were the drinks. My first time flying with Delta and a very positive experience. Will be booking with them again rather than their partners Virgin who I found (unusually) a little disappointing on the flight home.,9delta-air-lines,04/03/15,I managed to get back home 43 hours after I left my hotel to get my flight from NY JFK to Dublin. Given no explanation left standing in several queues for hours with refreshments only given hours later. When people in the queue started giving out as nobody had given any information or updates a Delta employee got the police. I'll go via Aer Lingus in future as I know they would not treat people like that. The flight return was maybe 15 euros cheaper but what a mistake it was.,delta-air-lines,04/03/15,I will never fly Delta again. My wife and I were scheduled to fly out of Atlanta to Wilmington and were made to check our carry on bags at the ramp 15 minutes later we were deplaned. We had just waited 45 minutes in the terminal for a flight crew. They board us and tell us weather stopped the flight. Don't insult our intelligence. That plane sat in my view for 4 hours and we were refused our luggage. 24 hours later no one at Delta knows where our bags are. We re-routed to OAJ customer service in Atlanta assured us they where re-routed. This was totally avoidable.,delta-air-lines,04/03/15,In early August 2014 I booked a Business Elite ticket from STT to ATL for February 22 2015. My confirmation indicated my seat number and that a meal was included in my ticket. At check-in however I found that Delta had changed my status to Economy with a seat far back in the aircraft. When I called Delta to rectify the situation I and my Son-in-law were both treated rudely. We spent 2 hours on the phone with the result being that I should â€œ request to be upgraded at the airport. At the airport there was another 30 minute wait before I could talk to a Delta representative only to learn that I'd have to appeal at the boarding desk. A one hour wait ensued at the head of the line at the departure desk while the Delta representative ignored me waited on other people and fiddled with a computer terminal that wasn't working. The end result was the same rudeness and no help at all. I got neither the meal nor the priority baggage check-in that I had paid for. The flight was late arriving in ATL and I had to run to make my connecting flight to BOS. Delta had changed my seat assignment on this flight also. When I called to file a complaint the Delta Supervisor informed me that Delta changes aircraft seat assignments and passenger status without notifying passengers and confirmed that they had sold my assigned seats to more than one person and that these were normalâ€ùpractices for Delta. I can't imagine why anyone would want to fly with Delta Airlines. Once they have your money they treat you like dirt or worse. There are plenty of other carriers out there. Based on this experience I can't see myself ever flying Delta again. I know I am not alone as there were at least 20 people in line behind me with similar complaints.,delta-air-lines,04/03/15,Left at the airport in Jamaica for 7.5 hours only to be told the flight was cancelled. Now at 11pm we needed to find our luggage go through the process of finding hotel reservations along with 100 other passengers. The next direct flight home to NYC was in two days. The following morning Delta tells us that our flight leaves in 40 minutes. Now we need to pack and get to the airport fast. We flew business elite and it was so disturbing to find that the armrest was broken and that no wifi or TV. Our choice of meal was eggs or cereal? Should have gone coach. The flight was not cheap and expected more. Realizing now why Delta is not our normal choice of airlines.,delta-air-lines,24/02/15,SJU-JFK in Economy Comfort seats. Late night flight out of SJU. Crew were fine. Economy Comfort seats had adequate legroom - glad we paid for the extra room because regular coach seats looked like torture for tall people. In flight entertainment though was terrible. Tiny overhead movie screens. I thought Delta had all seat back video screens. I would have been really annoyed had I spent the money to sit in First - those seats were not so much better than Econ Comfort and the same tiny overhead movie screens every few rows. We were handed a tiny roll with some cheese and turkey and a Milky Way with the beverage service. It was not a memorable flight and on this route JetBlue still wins every time.,6delta-air-lines,24/02/15,Flew from baton Rouge to Orlando Florida via Atlanta. What a mistake! Delayed on our outbound flight to Orlando by more than 5 hours. Delayed on our I bound flight by more than 3 hours. I will never fly Delta again.,delta-air-lines,24/02/15,12 hour flight TLV-JFK was excellent because of the crew. Upbeat polite couldn't do enough. Economy seating was fine and 3-3-3 configuration on 777 aircraft is very liveable for that duration. Dinner followed by as many sandwiches peanuts and pretzels as you can eat and as much as many beverages as you like all served with a smile both on request and on cabin pass throughs. Crew on this trip had seniority (I asked) and these were folks who understood the profession of customer service. Video on demand is top in class. A grade. Minus 1 point for lavatories that could have been kept a bit tidier for this long of a flight.,9delta-air-lines,24/02/15,We were traveling with a 10 month old infant. We were connecting flights at St Paul Airport to Kansas City. Our flight was supposed to depart at 7.35 pm. When we got to the gate we were told the flight was delayed for 2 hours. What amazed me was that the plane was at gate. When we asked then why the delay we were told that because there was no pilot available. Now we are getting stuck with our baby girl in the airport for 2 hours when we had no baby food left. No more Delta for me!,delta-air-lines,18/02/15,MAN-AMS-EWR EWR-ATL-MAN. Flights all left on time. Nice FA's. Regular drink/bar service. Nice that you get a bottle of water each. Main issue was that seats were uncomfortable on the flights to NY and back from Atlanta. Flights on these were on old 25 year planes and you felt it.,8delta-air-lines,18/02/15,Flew NYC-CDG via DTW on Delta. The positive point is I was upgraded to First Class on the US journey but this isn't worth it you only can drink whatever alcohol you like. Seats were uncomfortable on the over-atlantic flight staff rather impolite and not caring at all. Arrived on time. Food was not satisfying not tasty. Entertainment is to my eyes the only interesting point on Delta. Too expensive for so low standards.,3delta-air-lines,18/02/15,NRT-PDX-NRT in Premium Economy. I'm a frequent flyer with Delta but usually fly in business class. Going to Portland the food was far superior to the food on the return I'm certain it is because of the high level of catering here at NRT. On the return the amount of food was not good either and there was no food available in the galley. I had to beg to get peanuts and it seemed like I was getting a big favor from the FA (hello 10-hour flight no snack besides ice cream). The seat has enough legroom has a recline that doesn't interfere with the person behind you too much except for making the AV angle uncomfortable to watch for the one behind. Great AVOD which is Delta's selling point in economy. FAs pleasant but not overly so-just doing their job. The toilets were not cleaned throughout the flight. They were stocked with paper products but never once cleaned and trash was overflowing. It was bearable but not enjoyable overall. Hard to come down from business class with a lie-flat seat and good food.,7delta-air-lines,11/02/15,I flew Delta from St. Louis to Las Vegas via Minneapolis. All four legs left and arrived about on time. The planes MD-90 and 757 we're clean and comfortable. All four of my flights had wifi. The flight attendants were friendly and offered a small snack on the longer legs. The pilots made announcements as appropriate. I will fly Delta again if given the choice.,9delta-air-lines,11/02/15,LCA-AMS-EWR and EWR-CDG-LCA. Flights on time overall good service. Food drinks and entertainment was good. On return flight was bit delayed because of snow and baggage arrived day after because of handling issues at the transit on French airport (CDG).,9delta-air-lines,11/02/15,Flew from BOS to DFW via CVG January 23rd. Very good experience small aircraft both legs but clean I was in Economy Comfort. Flight attendants very good with excellent customer service. From CVG to DFW the flight was delayed due maintenance but it was repaired and the flight went without any issues. Arriving in Dallas just some minutes late but the baggage service was very good and the bags were out quickly. My return flight was DFW to BOS via ATL January 29th also very good planes were full both legs. I didn't get economy comfort on DFW-ATL but paid $19 for a preferred seat I think it was not a good idea since got group 2 and almost didn't get space for my carry-on because group 1 passengers almost got it all. I think if you are paying something extra for a seat you should go on group 1 despite that the flight was very good and the flight attendants were ok. The leg from ATL- BOS was very nice I got Economy Comfort flight attendants very professional and cool both flights departed and arrived on time.,10delta-air-lines,11/02/15,LGA-BNA operated by Endeavour Air on Jan 30th. Aircraft - 2 week old CRJ900. Departed 2 hours late due to the plane arriving late and the crew attempting (unsuccessfully) to fix a broken overhead bin lock. Eventually they gave up and scotch-taped the bin cover so it wouldn't open during the flight. Otherwise the flight was uneventful and fairly comfortable. Snacks and soft drinks were distributed and the FA's were attentive. My return flight from BNA got cancelled due to LGA completely shutting down due to the winter storm on Feb 2nd so I got rerouted to JFK via ATL. The 40-minute flight from BNA to ATL was uneventful and was on a completely full 23.5 y.o. A320. No food or drink service on this short flight. The ATL-JFK eventually departed 3 hours late despite most other JFK-bound domestic flight cancelled. The MD88 was completely full which was understandable given that the three previous flights to JFK were cancelled that day. Despite its age the aircraft was comfortable and the flight smooth. Upon landing in JFK we had to wait another 1.5 hours on the taxiway for a gate to become available. Bottom line: Delta got me back home albeit 8 hours late but I think that's pretty good given the circumstances.,6delta-air-lines,11/02/15,Flew LAX-YVR with Delta. My first time with Delta and I was impressed. Took a 6am flight so I was at the airport at around 4am but the staff was present and was able to lift my mood even without my morning coffee. Barely a wait for security or bag check. When I got to my gate the flight crew was already there and chatting with travellers. Boarding was quick. Unfortunately there was a slight delay due to 'mechanical failure' but I still arrived on time. FA were excellent with 3 drink services (I think) and offering coffee and water in-between. I slept about 1.5 hrs out of the three hour flight comfortably due to the lovely headrests that adjust in multiple ways. Didn't try to recline my chair however.,10delta-air-lines,11/02/15,Suffering from a sinus/head cold I was not anticipating my return from LAX-JFK-BDA on a red eye. My flight was scheduled to depart LAX at 9.40pm and I checked in at Delta's Priority counter around 8:00pm and proceeded quite quickly thru security and found my way to a very crowded SkyClub. When we boarded the aircraft I was pleased to discover that this plane was a newly converted B-767 with the new Business Elite product-proceeding to my seat my coat was stowed and I was served champagne in a champagne glass (so unlike American who still give you those tacky plastic cups) for a pre-flight drink. The seat was 4A and quite comfortable and reclined to a full lie flat bed a nice pillow and quilted blanket as well as an amenity kit. As soon as we were air borne I changed into pajamas and slept most of the way to JFK. The crew were quite keen to help as were the nice ladies in JFK SkyClub during my transit time for BDA. The JFK-BDA flight was also very pleasant although I slept on that one also. All in all a very nice experience with Delta on this route especially with the new Biz Elite product between LAX and JFK-will look forward to doing it again.,10delta-air-lines,06/02/15,LAX-JFK-Zurich 24th Dec 2014. Return Jan 7th 2015. First leg of the flight came in late so we missed our connecting flight. They scheduled everyone who missed the connection on the same flight a few hours later ensuring it was busting to capacity. No seats unused. Even though I get airsick and need to be next to the window they refused to accommodate-even though I'd paid more for a window seat on the flight their delay made me miss. Then later delayed on the runway 4 hours-apparently because they were waiting for a manifest. The seats were just atrocious. I've flown economy all my life and never felt so uncomfortable. I will do anything to never have to fly this airline again.,delta-air-lines,28/01/15,Traveled home from New York to Heathrow on 18/1/15 on Delta Airlines at 7pm flight DL401 with my Husband and three friends and our complaint is that the Stewards and the Stewardesses were totally ignorant and only spoke when asking us what we wanted (food and drink). They did not interact with the passengers at all and the food was almost thrown at us this was our first flight with Delta and it will be our last.,delta-air-lines,28/01/15,My daughter just flew in from Miami they cancelled hundreds of flights because of the incoming storm however they chose not to cancel hers took off 1 hour 15 minutes late. Landed 2 hours 15 minutes late diverted from LaGuardia to JFK shuttle service to LaGuardia was cancelled due to weather and they literally left their customers stranded with no way to retrieve their vehicles to get home. My daughter is currently stranded. This flight should have been cancelled as were all other flights.,delta-air-lines,26/01/15,"Philly Atlanta Sarasota and back. Out was an MD88 and MD90. Had a bad ankle. Gate agents allowed early boarding on both flights. FAs all friendly. Basic service no complaints. All flights all on time aircraft clean and plenty of room at 5' 10"". Return was MD90 and a 757. Again friendly gate agents and FAs flights all on time and overall good service. As an AE platinum card holder got free checked bag each way.",9delta-air-lines,23/01/15,Flew SYD-DCA via JFK and return from DCA-SYD via LAX. Both flights were really good. Very friendly cabin crew and individual greetings by the captain. Food was average plane food with 3 meal services from the SYD to LAX and LAX to SYD. I would definitely fly Delta again great service good clean aircraft and also a wide range of inflight entertainment.,10delta-air-lines,23/01/15,Columbus (CMH) to Managua Nicaragua and back. Personally I felt that Delta delivered an enjoyable experience and I would gladly travel with them again. 1) My initial flight from CMH to Atlanta went well. We left and arrived on time. The plane itself was clean and neat and seats were surprisingly comfortable although my shoulders could have used a little more room. Flight staff were courteous and even though we were on a booked flight I felt comfortable. 2) We experienced over a one hour delay from Atlanta to Managua and had to wait in the plane for about 45 minutes because of traffic over Florida (not Delta's fault). This plane was not nearly as nice as the first (no seat dividers) but the staff were friendly and the flight was still enjoyable. I flied in the Economy class upon my arriving flight. On the way from Managua to Columbus: 1) I flew in the business class cabin and was immediately greeted by friendly staff who were eager to give me whatever drink I desired. The seats were very comfortable and a delicious meal was served. The flight both left and arrived on time. 2) After arriving back in Atlanta we were greeted by an insanely long line to pass through customs. I don't know how much influence Delta had but I had a two hour lay over and just barely made it to my next flight. For the flight from Atlanta to Columbus I flew in the first class cabin which was surprisingly less comfortable than the business class one that I had been in previously. I slept for the majority of the time but was still given good customer service and the flight both left and arrived on time. After this experience I would recommend Delta but would suggest that you have at least a two hour layover to prevent any problems with connecting to another flight.,8delta-air-lines,21/01/15,I booked two round trip flights from Houston to Lagos Nigeria. The first leg of the first flight was in October 2014. On this leg I flew business class and the flight was comfortable and very pleasant. The return trips to Houston 2014 in December and to Lagos in January 2015 were a totally different story. I flew economy on these flights. The seats were terribly uncomfortable (even though I was in economy comfort) and the conditions were deplorable. By the end of the flight bathrooms were indescribable! There was all sorts of trash and food in the aisles were the passengers had apparently not taken the time to throw their refuse away. I have never had such a miserable experience.,delta-air-lines,19/01/15,We flew TUS-ATL-EVV on the way EVV-DTW-ATL-TUS on the way back. We have two kids and traveling is not always easy. But Delta did a fine job of making things smoother for us by letting us board early and treating our kids very well. (They seem to be the only airline that still gives kids their wings). We were delayed getting out of DTW and the pilots openly made an effort to get us to ATL on time recognizing that people had connections to make. They were true to their word taking a shortcut and flying at a higher speed and we arrived in ATL 10 minutes later rather than the 30-40 we expected. The MD-90 we flew between TUS and ATL was brand-new inside and we were impressed by the service we received from the crew. The fact that you get a drink and a snack is nice I know people that fly Delta just for the Biscoff cookies. The planes are for the most in great condition though the Airbus 320 we flew had a few loose tray tables and could stand to be updated. I've been pretty dissatisfied with American airlines except for Southwest but Delta trumps all of them in terms of flight quality service and passenger dedication. One small irritation: some of the in-flight entertainment is pay-per-view.,9delta-air-lines,19/01/15,Travelled from Detroit to Paris in Business Elite on Delta's Airbus returning from Rome to Atlanta on a B767. To say the least I was extremely pleased on both flights though the 767 was a little tighter in comparison to the B777 and Airbus. Service food were excellent. Delta continues to be my favorite airline.,9delta-air-lines,19/01/15,Connecting flight was boarding when my first flight was landing. Agent at the desk said she would call through but I had to get from one end of the airport to the other. I am an older person and went as fast as I could. My mouth went sandpaper dry and I felt quite faint only to arrive at the next flight to find the gate closed! It was Deltas fault I was late there should have been plenty of time between flights if they hadn't delayed so long leaving a small airport initially that didn't have a line up of flights going out. They spent too much time deciding whether or not to de-ice the plane! I'm glad they were careful and did it but could have got the job done a lot faster and got the flight in on time. As the plane for my next flight was still there I begged the agent at the adjacent gate to allow me to board as I couldn't spend the night and next morning in Minneapolis waiting for a flight to Newark. Fortunately she co-operated called through and they opened the door to let me on. I felt the stewardess was unfriendly as I boarded the plane probably thinking I should have been there on time. I think in situations like this there should be some pick up at the gate to get you to the next flight without having to nearly make yourself sick to get there and following flights should wait for all booked passengers making connections when Delta has caused the delay. This might have been a one off situation. I usually have found Delta friendly and helpful as the agent was who helped me to get on my flight.,7delta-air-lines,14/01/15,Took the trouble to order kosher and vegetarian meals for my party of 4 only to find that the kosher meal comprised an apple and 2 bananas and the vegetarian meal was some cut melon - Delta seem to have lost all creativity when it comes to meals? To make matters worse since half the flight must have ordered the same special meal none of which was opened or eaten by any passenger the flight crew then proceeded to open each sealed package and throw out the fruit so that they could retrieve their special cheap Delta plates for later use. I personally witnessed at least 20 such meals being discarded. I regret having had to use Delta on this trip after having managed to avoid it for so many years.,3delta-air-lines,14/01/15,JFK-NRT-SIN. Lounge at JFK was nice the flight was long and seats were narrow. The food could be improved but then again the catering was from JFK so my expectations weren't high. Crew were fine and overall the flight was good. Wish I used the showers in the NRT lounge as I was in for a longer wait than expected. Departure was pushed back an hour and we waited another hour and a half on the ground due to traffic. The staff handled the delay well and the wait was more comfortable than expected. Landed in SIN at 3am as a result. Still good experience overall.,9delta-air-lines,14/01/15,Horrible experience all around. The priority level ticket agent was not able to find the ticket for our lap child wasting 45 minutes of our time at check-in. When it was finally found on their system they were not able to print it for us. Just very frustrating and stressful. The business class on Delta is laughable. Lets see drop down screens from the ceiling no different than they had in the 1980s. The movie didn't even work on the return flight. Food quality I wouldn't even feed to my dogs. Its pretty bad when you buy a business class ticket and you don't even get a movie on a 5.5 hour flight or a decent meal.,1delta-air-lines,14/01/15,"My daughter and I traveled from Winnipeg to Basel recently. Our return flight from Paris to Minneapolis was delayed and therefore we had to rush to our connecting flight. Little did we know how far apart the terminals were. Delta staff should have informed us of the distance and offered a passenger trolley. It turned out that as we arrived at our departure gate the information board said ""Boarding"" however the Delta staff person would not let us board. While we waited at least 10 minutes for a supervisor we watched the information change from ""Boarding"" to ""Closed"" and we watched our plane depart without us (along with another passenger in our circumstances). We were booked on another flight seven hours later meal vouchers were denied as we waited the seven hours we saw instances (more than one) where other passengers were allowed to board after the ""Closed"" sign was on. Delta staff were not prepared to assist us in any way nor did they appear to be trained in customer service. This is just one issue albeit the biggest one that we had with Delta personnel giving incorrect information being rude (not the FA - this was all with the staff at the various airports we dealt with). The FA's were wonderful on all flights - perhaps Delta would best be served if they did the training to the airport staff.",delta-air-lines,14/01/15,"As a frequent traveler I feel I've coped pretty well with the US Airline ""nickel and dime"" mentality that's resulted in baggage fees exorbitant ticket change fees and the dwindling supply base fare economy class seats (not to mention the dwindling leg room in those seats). Now Delta does not allow seat selection with economy class fares. My company do not allow class upgrades which means I'll forever be the really tall guy stuck in a middle bulkhead seat if I fly Delta. Old planes with no power no in-flight entertainment (it never fails to amaze me how many ancient CRT televisions are still mounted to the roof of Delta cabins). On longer flights Delta refuses to stock enough food to meet the demand of passengers towards the back of the plane. Sure I can survive a 6 hour flight with nothing but peanuts and pretzels but why? The only positive thing I can say about Delta is to give a kudos to the majority of attendants that are willing to put up with grouchy passengers and restrictive rules. The ones that maintain a positive attitude deserve an award.",1delta-air-lines,11/01/15,Flew Comfort Economy YYC-HKG return. Booked flight 6 months in advance (and got a great deal) but over the next four months our flight itinerary was changed six times. Since some of the changes impacted our flight by over an hour I called to change to other flights - agents were happy to help out and they answer their phones promptly - a pleasant change compared to the waits we usually experience with our regular airline Air Canada. Alerted by email of all but one of the changes which I noticed by accident. We had paid extra for Comfort Economy and one of the changes meant that the fee for Comfort Economy was higher - instead of notifying us that we needed to pay an extra $20 to keep our Comfort Economy seats they just put us in a regular Economy seat and kept the $130 we'd paid to begin with! Thank goodness I noticed. Flights themselves were good. The extra leg room on the long haul flight was wonderful. Wide selection of entertainment. Plenty of food/drink offered and quality not bad (daytime hot meals ok mid flight snack fine breakfast awful). Service attentive. Very cheerful on the way there and pleasant on the return flight. Connecting flights from Calgary-Seattle were on old planes but fine for a one hour flight - staff were great. I would fly Delta again.,7delta-air-lines,11/01/15,LHR-JFK return. I tend to pick Delta due to the affordability and nice service. Again I was not disappointed. Flight going out of London on time and plane not full. Got plenty of space and the food was good. Coming back to London the flight was packed and the plane was slight older however the food and service was good. I asked for a special meal that was accommodated on both flights! Happy to fly Delta again for sure!,9delta-air-lines,05/01/15,PDX-AMS-PDX. I was seated in economy plus for the both legs and this is definitely more pleasurable than the basic economy. However the seat cushion still remain hard and quite uncomfortable for a 10 hours flight. Food was okay and very good entertainment system. The crew was professional and attentive on the PDX-AMS. Unfortunately the cabin crew on the return flight was borderline lazy doing the minimum and spending more time socializing on the back of the aircraft than paying attention to the passenger and especially the cleanliness of the bathrooms.,6delta-air-lines,05/01/15,"ATL-JNB-ATL Business Class. Atlanta flight was on time and the flight crew was very ""seasoned"". Service was good. Food was ok. Nothing special. Seats are great - I'm tall and they do the trick. VOD system is outdated and flight tracker rarely works. The return flight was about an hour late and the crew was much better. Food from JNB was much better than first flight. I would rate the second crew as outstanding. It's all about the seat and the business elite seat is among the best for such a long flight.",9delta-air-lines,05/01/15,I flew SFO-LAX on a Delta Shuttle emb-175 in first class seat 4A. The seat cushion was pretty hard but fortunately it was only a 50 minute flight. Honestly the first class seats on the emb-175 aren't great and I would never pay for them just upgrade using miles or medallion upgrade.,8delta-air-lines,05/01/15,We flew Delta Airlines 777 business class from LAX to Bangkok (via Narita) in October 2014. The seating configuration is one of the best we have seen internationally. The lie flat seats were enhanced with two pillows and a comforter. The second/smaller pillow worked very well for your legs/knees over the long flight. The comforter was the most enjoyable blanket we have ever experienced on an international trip. It's amazing that such a small difference in quality can make such a large difference in the sleeping comfort and environment. The only complaint about the seat configuration is that it is difficult to communicate with a traveling partner.,10delta-air-lines,05/01/15,OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.,5delta-air-lines,05/01/15,My flight with Delta was a short 1 hour trip from LAX to SFO. It was unfortunately delayed due to bad weather but the service on the flight definitely made up for this. Drinks peanuts and pretzels were offered soon after departing LAX and a healthy snack box filled with trail mix wholegrain crackers guacamole tomatoes celery and carrots was also provided. I did not expect this to be included in the price at all on such a short flight! After flying with another airline on a domestic US trip the service on Delta definitely stood out and I would definitely fly with them again.,8delta-air-lines,05/01/15,Flew Atlanta-Dubai Economy. FA were very good but the economy seats are very poor. Packed flight so no elbow or leg room. Left on time. Food and service decent.,6delta-air-lines,05/01/15,PDX-AMS-PDX: Flew on economy comfort for both legs. The PDX-AMS was good with the typical Delta service which has improved over the years. Aircraft was clean and a very good IFE. For the return flight it was quite different starting with a very disorganized Delta security at the gate. The contracted agent were borderline rude and did not have a clue what they were doing. During the flight the cabin crew appeared to do a minimal job and could care less about the service and especially the state of sanitary conditions of the restrooms. Delta management should work on improving the consistency of their crew.,6delta-air-lines,05/01/15,TPA to LAX on 12-10-14 B737 Economy Comfort another routine Delta Flight. Uncomfortable seats with slightly more legroom than economy but with minimum recline. I give Delta low ratings on account of the uncomfortable seats. Otherwise it's pretty much like other U.S. carriers. Food for purchase. I didn't buy any so rated it at one star. Charge for entertainment headphones didn't buy a set so I also rated entertainment at one star. I fly Delta only because my spouse has Platinum FF status and buys my tickets with her FF miles. Otherwise I'd like to try other airlines.,4delta-air-lines,31/12/14,"We bought a round trip ticket trough Air France but the operating airline was Delta. On our outbound flight from ATL-MAD the plane was very small for a Transatlantic flight uncomfortable seats entertainment screens didn't work and the crew were not helpful with the needs of the 1 year old traveling with us well strangely enough this was our ""good flight."" On the way back we flew from Amsterdam to Atlanta the flight got delayed due to bad weather conditions because of that we lost our connecting flight that we can understand what was appalling to us was the rudeness unwillingness to help and basically bad attitude of the flight attendants who are supposedly there to assist you. We certainly will do our best to not purchase a Delta ticket again.",delta-air-lines,29/12/14,Took flight DL403 from JFK to LHR. Bag drop and check in was friendly and fast as was boarding. Seats were leather/plastic and not fabric and felt comfier than many others. Entertainment system was buggy and rebooted once as well as skipping/pausing throughout films. Food was bland but passable: chicken and rice meal with brownie bread and salad for dinner and a croissant with jam for breakfast (with orange juice). Service wasn't that friendly but also the announcements were amateurish with long pauses repeated interruptions and announcing the wrong arrival terminal before later correcting herself! I didn't know until this flight that seat changes within economy class can cost $40 each even if passengers on the same booking were placed in seats far away from each other on different rows (and the seat change was to bring them together).,4delta-air-lines,22/12/14,GIG-ATL on refurbed 67-300ER (economy) and can honestly say it was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever taken. I am 6'2 and whilst normally I can find airline seats restricting this was the worst I have experienced. I can never before remember having to sit open legged as my knees do not fit in the seat when my legs are side by side including when using budget carriers. What's more the head restraint didn't stay in position making it doubly uncomfortable for a man of my height and despite the seat being in the middle of the plane there was no recline (not that there was any room to recline into). Food was ok drinks only served once despite it being almost a 10 hour flight and the entertainment system had only old movies and the TV box sets were missing random episodes meaning it was difficult to watch anything sequentially. Not a good advert for a Delta and will certainly bare this in mind when it comes to booking again in future.,3delta-air-lines,18/12/14,"DSM/MSP/LHR 30th November LHR/MSP/DSM 6th December 2014. On all of the flights taken I was treated well by all staff check-in and in-flight. The airplanes were clean even the two short haul flights when the turnaround was very tight. Delta cabin staff are certainly the best by a long mile as compared with the other legacy airline staff in the USA. My flights were a combination of First (internally) and Business (Trans Atlantic). The food on the Trans Atlantic flight was pretty good. My only comment regarding the whole food and beverage service was that the red wine on the LHR/MSP leg was chilled. The equipment used for my Trans Atlantic flight was a 767-400ER which was comfortable (I prefer the Business seating in the 767 as opposed to the A330) and I managed to sleep for 4 hours east bound. Delta are a good airline. People can make or break a business and now it certainly seems that the Delta people will ""make"" the business.",10delta-air-lines,18/12/14,JFK-ATL-AUS in F. Decided to pay First Class to try their product and Delta has done an excellent job revamping their JFK base. Check-in at the separate Sky Priority area was a top-notch experience it has a completely separate entrance and the area is cozy and classy complete with a seating area and little water bottles at the check in desks. Priority security line was a bonus since it was rush hour and the regular line was just insane. Priority boarding was strictly enforced which was good. Plane to Atlanta on a 757 equipped with the older transcontinental product. Seats were extremely plush and comfortable with great recline and legroom was excellent. Wouldn't mind sitting on those seats on a longer flight. I wish the leg rest would have extended higher though. Breakfast was served which was smoked salmon toasted bagel fresh fruit and yoghurt. I've read positive reviews about Delta's F catering and this was no exception. Everything was fresh presentation was excellent and quantity hit the spot nicely. My only major issue on this flight was the flight lead that served the first cabin he was a tad cold and didn't really interact with the passengers which I admire about US airlines. Service however was efficient and service calls and requests were all honored on a timely fashion. Entertainment system didn't work until half an hour before landing but it wasn't too much of an issue selections for movies shows and music were all great. ATL-AUS on an older 757 seats were huge and comfortable but legroom was limited but still sufficient. Flight attendants were more friendly however only snack options were available despite being a longer flight. Drinks and snacks were provided regularly and were of good quality. Overall Delta is serious about transforming itself as a global airline with a great reputation. All flights were on-time their hard product is reliable catering is excellent and even though I had some issues with service Delta still provided a great flight experience and would not hesitate to fly with them again.,8delta-air-lines,18/12/14,4/30/14 JFK-LHR was a pleasant experience (evening flight). The Delta Ground Crew were fine but had some issues with regards to an additional carry on item when the Airport Customs denied our entry towards the Immigration Area. Boarded on time on a B767-400ER. Seats felt tight with limited legroom but a very comfortable back rest. Ordered our meals online when booking however my meal was not available on the flight but it was fine to wait for the general food selection. Flight entertainment was excellent getting to watch the latest movie releases of the year. Flight Crew were well accommodated on this full flight. Land safely at LHR with a delay of 50 mins. 5/14/14 Return leg LHR-JFK was a disappointment. The older B767-300 aircraft had a rusty smell. Food selections we chose online were again unavailable. Flight crew were less friendly to passengers fewer smiles yet one of the FAs stood out very well in performance. The seats were a lot of worst with thinner padding making it extremely uncomfortable to lean your back all the way. The restrooms were awful unlike the first leg which was spotless. The same goes with the cleanliness of the cabins. Overall flying with Delta would mean riding old planes and comfort is less of a priority in economy class. Delta is my top choice when flying Domestically but definitely out of the box for international and long haul travel. Next time I travel to Europe BA goes next in the list.,5delta-air-lines,10/12/14,In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar. Delta is the last airline I would choose in the future.,3delta-air-lines,10/12/14,"I have been flying Delta for years (several with Diamond status). I am currently gold status. At JFK Terminal 2 in the TSA pre-check line the Delta representative made me go back and check my bag because it didn't fit in their little container which they claim is what a 22"" bag should fit in. I have been carrying-on the same roller bag for the last 8 years. Now they make me check it? I don't get it. I flew with this same bag this last Saturday the Saturday before that the Thursday before that - and carried it on every time. Terrible customer service for your most loyal business travelers.",delta-air-lines,04/12/14,DL352 from Nashville to Detroit. Advised that the flight will be full and customers are allowed one personal item and one carry-on bag which must fit within the size check box. My carry-on was approximately 1 inch too wide due to my use of the one inch expansion zipper. So my option was to pay to have my bag checked or to use the other small duffle I had inside of my carry-on. So I basically carried on the same weight of items which now took up twice the amount of room. I understand that there has to be rules but common sense needs to come in to play at some point.,3delta-air-lines,04/12/14,Flew DL from Milan to JFK after arriving on Etihad couldn't wait to see how DL matched up. I was impressed with the level of service from crew bantering with passengers smiling as they went about their duties so eager to serve. The IFE and meals were equally impressive far better than my preceding flight on Etihad flight. This is surely an improvement from the Delta I used to know perhaps the competition is bringing out a different side.,9delta-air-lines,04/12/14,DFW-ATL-RSW DFW-ATL in Economy Comfort and ATL-RSW in Economy. Checked in online and it took less than 5 minutes to get through DFW security on a Saturday morning. I was greeted by a friendly gate agent who smiled while welcoming me onboard - what a concept for a domestic airline these days. Onboard the FAs were equally pleasant with the First Class FA even offering to hang the coat of an Economy Class passenger. Snack choice consists of peanuts pretzels or Biscoff - while this isn't much it's still more than you get on any other domestic airline. First leg arrived nearly 20 minutes early and the transit in ATL was painless though keep in mind it is a very large airport if you have a tight connection. Boarding was delayed slightly on the second leg to RSW though we pushed back only a few minutes late and arrived 5 minutes early. This flight was not full and the FAs were once again cheerful while performing the beverage service (but only pretzels this time and no Biscoffs). Captains on both legs kept us well-informed with regards to our route and progress speaking to passengers twice on both legs. Overall I couldn't ask for any more from a domestic flight in coach.,9delta-air-lines,04/12/14,Disappointed traveler. Travelled to Europe via Delta and experience was not good. From terrible food to constantly moving seat assignments unless we upgraded to secure seats together. Food was not very good - service from JFK to PDX was non-existent. I would not recommend this airline and will avoid in the future.,1delta-air-lines,04/12/14,GRU-JFK business class JFK-SEA and LAX-ATL in first class ATL-GRU in business class. Biz class in 767-300s was great lie-flat seats. 1-2-1 configuration. First class was standard. 757 for JFK-SEA not spacious but felt roomier than in the domestic 767 from LAX-ATL (2-2-2 in first class). Food on all flights especially the international legs was good. Having priority check-in at LAX was especially welcome as I didn't have to take my bags over to the checked bag x-ray station. I didn't need the allowance of 3 checked bags up to 70 lbs for biz class to Brazil but it can be a plus. Service was good especially on the international legs. We chose Delta because it cost less than American or United for this trip. Delta's requirements for using frequent flyer miles is worse than the others but the flights were very good.,8delta-air-lines,01/12/14,Four flights with Delta LHR-JFK-TPA_ATL-LHR all flights departed on time seats were comfortable and plenty of legroom including the internal flights food typical airline beef chicken or pasta ok and just about edible. Entertainment was very good with large seat back tvs good selection of movies and shows plus a number of games music selection was disappointing and more variety is needed there. Cabin crew worked hard doing numerous drink runs on the international flights beer and wine is free otherwise about $6/7 for internal flights. I like Delta and would fly them in future if their prices remain competitive.,9delta-air-lines,25/11/14,My wife and I flew first class from Fort Lauderdale to La Guardia on October 27 2014. What a pleasantry that experience was. We flew first class and was extremely pleased with the service and with the attendants courteous manners. The meal we had was hot the drinks were served promptly and we were always asked if there was anything else they could do to ensure us a pleasant flight and comfort.,10delta-air-lines,25/11/14,"12/3 flight 1215 Boston to Salt Lake City. Flight 1674 Salt Lake City to Portland (Oregon). I flew Delta for the first time traveling in first it will definitely be the last. Completely inattentive flight attendants no personal service of any kind - about the only ""perks"" of first were express lines for security and a mass produced meal. In flight received no attention no offers of anything to drink - in fact felt completely ignored.",delta-air-lines,25/11/14,Took Delta flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City. I have been flying fairly frequent for the last 10 years and this is the worst plane I have ever been on. The flight is just over four hours and the isn't any form of entertainment not even the really old TV's that 25 rows share. I purchased the gogo inflight wifi that cost me $15 for the four hours and it barley has enough speed to check email. You can definitely forget streaming anything or play any game or app that requires the internet. (I tried) The air conditioning was apparently broken as well because it is about 80+ degrees in the plane. Worst flight/plane I have ever been on. I was on more advanced planes 10 years ago. Staff came by one time to offer any drinks or refreshment.,delta-air-lines,25/11/14,I flew from Madison-Detroit-Paris-Pisa and return through Rome. On the way there the short flight from Madison was quick and on time. Had plenty of time in Detroit (even though its not the most exciting airport). The transatlantic flight was operated by Air France 777. Excellent as usual. Other short flight to Pisa was okay. Nothing special. On return we rode an A330 from Rome to Detroit. My brother and I had window seats and IFE systems were great. Food was as good as any other airline (though not better than Air France). In Detroit had 2 hours until connection and everything was smooth. Overall great seats food and IFE's both ways.,10delta-air-lines,25/11/14,"Flew from Huntsville AL to Atlanta and then to Hong Kong via Seattle. Then returned from Sydney via LAX. On three of the six legs of this trip Delta rearranged our (long in advance) seating. We were notified only once (the night before our morning departure). Supposedly a ""service animal"" was needed in our Economy Comfort seats on the ATL to SEA leg. I understand and accept that. But when we boarded the occupants of the seats we had originally booked the occupants were young and apparently in good heath. No sign of a service animal. I will never again purchase Economy Comfort when it doesn't seem to mean anything and is quite expensive. Also I will do everything I can to not fly Delta in the future. Finally I will tell my story again and again every time I can so that others can be fore-warned.",2delta-air-lines,25/11/14,LHR-JFK-TPA-ATL-LHR. All flights departed on time seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom especially on the internal flight food was typical airline beef or chicken and a pasta on the return leg free beer and wine on the international flights liquor payable by debit or credit card only. Entertainment was very good with seat back large screens and a good selection of movies and TV shows I felt the music selection could be improved by more choice. I have flown Delta 3 times now and find them a good airline and reasonable fares I hope to book my next flights with them.,9delta-air-lines,20/11/14,Flown this airline twice from Amsterdam to Detroit and had a terrible experience each time. My flight departing from Amsterdam has always never left on time. Both times my flight was delayed at least 2 hours so in both cases I have missed my onward connecting flight in Detroit. This also resulted in my bag not arriving on time. However apart from the fact that I have never been on a Delta flight that has left or arrived on time the in- flight experience is quite good. Their food is always hot and very tasty they have a good variety in their in flight entertainment and their seats are quite comfy. But due to the fact that I have been delayed and missed my flight so many times because of Delta I will probably never fly them again.,5delta-air-lines,20/11/14,DL836 30 Oct. I fly Delta from HOU-ATL-HNL and return several times each month. I go out of my way to travel through ATL as opposed to DFW on AA or IAH-HNL non-stop on UA. The upgraded A330 cabins with lie flat all-aisle access seats in Business are a refreshing treat from other tired equipment on AA and UA. ATL-HNL is considered an overwater international segment with all the amenities of a transatlantic or transpacific flight. On my recent trip GOGO inflight satellite WIFI was available making a productive business trip in each direction!,10delta-air-lines,12/11/14,Flew JFK-SLC 5 November 2014. Flew economy in an exit row. Ok flight but entertainment system did not operate full flight with no place to move to. Seat did not recline. 4.5 hour flight excellent FA but had to pay for food (I declined). On time take off and arrival.,7delta-air-lines,12/11/14,"DTW-PEK and PVG-DTW Economy comfort. I must say that I fly transpacific on Delta at least 6 times per year and it has been consistently good each trip. They used tired old 747's and A330's from the old Northwest days but a completely refurbished cabin makes it feel like a new plane. Huge new seatback screens feature USB and charging ports. Delta is making an effort to upgrade economy service on transpacific flights handing out free eyeshades earplugs and greatly improved ""Billboard"" branded earbuds. Delta on Demand has hundreds of movies TV and music choices to keep you occupied on these 14 hour flights. Food service is about the same edible but nothing special. Two hot meals and a mid-flight snack consisting of a sandwich fruit and cookie. Service by veteran flight attendants at the top of the seniority list is pleasant and friendly. Overall it can't compare with the Asian airlines on service but not much to complain about.",8delta-air-lines,12/11/14,Highly Recommended. Flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. Check-in was smooth and on time departure. Courteous flight crew good food - was too much though and nice comfortable seat. On-time arrival and speedy baggage delivery. Overall outstanding experience and would like to choose Delta for future international trips.,10delta-air-lines,12/11/14,BDL-SJC and back via ATL. Coach between BDL and ATL both ways and First between ATL and SJC both ways. First was good unless you are in a bulkhead seat and you are over 6 feet tall. Other than that the aircraft cabin (new 739) was nice and the service was great. Coming back the flight was delayed for an hour which was awful though I slept through the delay. On the bright side I had plenty of time to connect to BDL.,8delta-air-lines,11/11/14,Flew PDX-ATL ATL-CUN CUN-LAX then LAX-PDX. PDX-ATL was very clean on a very well maintained 737-900 attendants accommodated sister's nut allergy made sure no nuts or nut containing items were opened good IFE good wifi. ATL-CUN was disappointing. Attendants were friendly and hilarious but the MD-88 was in decrepit shape with a broken sound system broken lights broken a/c etc. CUN-LAX was a bit better of a plane but not as good of a 737 as the first flight (737-700 i believe slightly unclean and lots of TV's weren't working) and LAX-PDX on the CRJ900 was great. 2 drinks snacks as expected aircraft was very clean and had a brand new feeling.,7delta-air-lines,03/11/14,Just leaving Detroit for Boston. Overhead bins are half empty. As usual attendants insist baggage be checked which adds considerable and unnecessary time to trip in Boston. Otherwise adequate trip. Seats fairly squeezed but similar to other legacy airlines. No food or entertainment options.,5delta-air-lines,03/11/14,ALB-IAH DL2033/2249. Delta would not let me choose a seat at purchase or check-in. They put me in a middle seat. Now to get out of the seat (into a window seat in the same row) I need to pay them $19. I did not get a fair chance to select a type of seat I wanted even early on in the process. So I am being forced into an uncomfortable seat and into making a payment if I want to fly with more comfort.,1delta-air-lines,31/10/14,My wife and I were supposed to fly out of Fort Myers on Oct 22/14 after booking our flights two months in advance. When we got to the airport 3 hours before our flight we were told our flight was cancelled and we would have to wait until 8.30 the next day before we could leave. We had to call for a ride ask to stay an additional day - all with no notice! They had all of my contact info and never called. I believe our flight wasn't full so they bumped us to the next morning to fill that flight. This is unacceptable you schedule your flights to fit into your time schedule not theirs. How are you supposed to plan a trip not knowing when they will cancel the flight for no reason do not use Delta if you need to be somewhere on time!,1delta-air-lines,31/10/14,Was pleasantly surprised by Delta service in Economy class on a round trip between DTW and AMS on Oct. 10 (outbound) and Oct 17 (inbound). Cabin services both ways was attentive throughout the flight - something that some other US-based carriers fail to grasp. The Economy class food was actually tasty and abundant especially on the AMS-DTW flight. Am happy to find a US-based carrier that can hold its own in Economy class against its Euro- competitors. So would definitely recommend Delta service between DTW and AMS as a gateway between the US and Europe - even in Economy the journey is part ot the enjoyment of the overall trip.,9delta-air-lines,28/10/14,October 17th 2014. Traverse City Michigan (TVC) to DTW DTW-LAX LAX-SMF. TVC-DTW and LAX-SMF on Delta Connection. DTW-LAX on Delta. The FAs on the connection flights were courteous and competent. On Delta after the beverage cart had gone by I asked a passing FA for a second glass of wine. She refused to bring it told me I'd have to wait until the beverage cart returned which was over an hour later. The Economy Comfort seats on Delta were not much better than economy - slightly more legroom but the recline seemed the same. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. The Economy Comfort seats on the Connection flights felt more comfortable. Delta provided a wide array of entertainment choices. I only fly Delta because my spouse buys my tickets with her frequent flyer miles. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights on account of the uncomfortable seats. Next time my spouse and I fly to Europe or Asia I will ask her to use her FF miles for flights on a Delta partner with better seats.,3delta-air-lines,28/10/14,10-12-14 SEA-DTW-TVC. SEA-DTW on Delta DTW-TVC on Delta Connection. The blue vinyl seats on Delta were very uncomfortable had minimal legroom and recline the plastic armrests hurt my arms after an hour or so. I was unable to sleep because the headrest pushed my head forward. Seats on Delta Connection were more comfortable. My one star rating is for the Delta seats. I didn't use the inflight entertainment system which appeared to have a good selection. I would not recommend Delta for long haul flights. My spouse purchased my ticket with her frequent flyer miles. Next month when we fly from California to Florida I'll ask her to book our flight on a Delta partner if possible. The Delta seats are too uncomfortable for long haul flights. Same goes for our upcoming trips to Europe and Thailand next year.,3delta-air-lines,28/10/14,"In September I flew Delta round trip Detroit - London - Detroit business elite class on planes with the lay-flat seats. Let's be honest and call them ""pods"" not seats. These plastic ""pods"" must be the most uncomfortable cramped seats ever designed for an airplane. I am only 5'1"" weigh 125# and even at that small size I felt wedged into a narrow hard space. Seats are narrow hard moulded vinyl and there is absolutely no room for anything. Couldn't even figure out where to store the provided quilt and pillow. Sit on it? Put it on the floor where it immediately becomes wedged under the seat or you have to walk on it to get out/in your seat? Fold out trays are tiny and almost useless as are the provided ""pockets"" (shallow moulded indents that won't even keep a bottle of water upright) for magazines books papers bottled water etc. Attempting to stand up or leave your seat is a major challenge. Apparently the expected protocol is to wedge yourself into the ""pod"" and not move for eight hours. Never again!",5delta-air-lines,22/10/14,Flew SYD-LAX 1 Oct and returned 13 Oct - After reading reviews online I was a bits hesitant to fly Delta but was pleasantly surprised by the airline. Found the service to be quite good food had a good variety and all meals were served hot. Also good idea about placing the snacks out for passengers to help themselves. Great choice of movies and TV shows to pass the time. Seats were a little uncomfortable but overall a good experience and would definitely fly Delta again!,7delta-air-lines,22/10/14,Worst business class I have ever travelled on. The product provided on my trip from LA to San Jose is nothing close to what is represented on the Delta website nor as described in their inflight magazine. We had expectations of lie flat beds on the last leg of our long journey from Melbourne (Australia) to San Jose Costa Rica. To make matters worse this last leg with Delta was an overnight flight - so we had been travelling in excess of 24hrs before boarding Delta. What a disappointment to find we were on possibly the oldest aircraft I have flown it had a 2 person bench seat format with an individual backrest that only slightly reclined. The inflight food service was lousy (very similar to an economy meal on a domestic flight). Then to top it off there was a Dog (yes a canine) sitting / sleeping in seat 1B right next to us! There was no insert entertainment system there was a very old box TV hanging from the ceiling in the aisle which from Seat 1D I couldn't quite see very well.,1delta-air-lines,20/10/14,Went from LAX to Sydney. Staff rude food awful. Only good thing was premium economy seating. The seats were hard - no frills but extra leg room. Worth the difference but would not fly Delta again.,3delta-air-lines,12/10/14,Flew GSO-ATL-SLC-PHX/ LAS-DTW-GSO on a paid First Class ticket - cost only 30% more than the coach ticket and well worth it. DL is working hard to be a serious airline and it's mostly paying off. All flights were on time and generally the service and food very good including a new beef enchilada (really!) lunch item that was excellent. The omelette breakfast out of LAS however- not so much. For me the biggest issue with DL is the age of the fleet. Both long legs were on vintage (25 years old plus) 757s with no modern amenities except pay for WIFI. These old ships showed their age throughout including (my pet peeve) dreadful bathrooms no entertainment whatsoever and old style overhead bins. The one flight with no first class section was aboard the dreaded CRJ200 for a 90 minute flight.. DL generously assigned seat 14A with a GE engine seemingly in the next seat. When will the airlines fulfil their promise of dumping these dogs altogether rather than just moving them from one fleet to another? Overall though satisfaction delivered.,8delta-air-lines,12/10/14,JFK-FCO return Business class on Sept. 25 - Oct. 5. on A330 - this is the best business class seat by far. Seats newly configured 1-2-1 with easy aisle access. Seat controls entertainment system electronics all user friendly. Lots of entertainment options viewed on a 16-inch flat panel screen. Exceptional service and excellent meal choices.,10delta-air-lines,08/10/14,Honolulu to LA. Lucked out with an internationally equipped aircraft for this normally cramped flight. Great lie flat seat wonderful crew decent meal and excellent entertainment. The B767 business elite made the trip a pleasure but why does the dessert come on the tray when there is plenty of time to do a separate service? This is a pet peeve of mine makes the service seem pedestrian.,9delta-air-lines,08/10/14,Have just arrived in Rio de Janeiro from Miami with a change of planes in Atlanta. From Miami to Atlanta pilot did not even announce the flight duration. From Atlanta to Rio service was certainly not bad by U.S. standards. IFE was good-managed to watch a new release in my personal screen-while alcoholic beverages were also complementary throughout the flight. Arrived on-time in Rio de Janeiro only to find-out that my luggage did not make the tight connection in Atlanta. All in all certainly an acceptable trip and would do it again.,7delta-air-lines,08/10/14,"Just added Delta to the airlines that I will never fly again. American was the only one with that recognition previously. Booked flight for two from Des Moines to San Francisco and return. Outgoing flight was as planned and no problems. Noticed when I checked in the day before flight that return connection from Minneapolis to DSM had gone from 1 hour to 3+ hour layover. Just tried to change departure time from SFO to Minneapolis so flight would make more sense (1 hour layover). Said they would be happy to for $235! I make sane rationale reservations with ""standard"" layovers and airline changes (or cancels) a flight doesn't inform me and after I learn about it and try to make sense of the booking again they are happy to change for additional $$$. There is something very wrong with this picture. In the future they have 2 empty seats from my wife and me.",delta-air-lines,05/10/14,Flew SYD-LAX-MNL. All flights were on time aircraft were clean staff very friendly food satisfactory lavatories well maintained and inflight entertainment stable with a great selection of choices. Safety was adhered to throughout flights. Check-in was smooth. However LAX could have more staff support during the check-in process. Baggage arrived promptly after each flight. Will fly Delta again.,9delta-air-lines,05/10/14,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 Transcon. Flight pushed back 5 mins ahead of schedule and arrived 30 mins early. The aircraft was recently refitted and the new cabin is spectacular. Felt clean modern fresh airy bright and very comfortable. The IFE was superb. Screens were huge choice was endless and picture quality great (not the standard screens you see on most aircraft). Staff were attentive and happy - came around with the drinks/snacks cart twice and I lost count how many times they came around offering water. Tea/coffee and snacks are complimentary sandwiches etc available for purchase. For a long coast to coast flight Delta far exceeded my expectations.,9delta-air-lines,01/10/14,Flights 476 and 477. Flew first Class to Barcelona Spain on August 17 2014. Excellent service.,10delta-air-lines,01/10/14,First class from PDX to LAX. On time good seat comfortable and plenty of space. Easy check in and boarding. Early arrival. Inflight food and beverages woeful. Very limited beverages and my choice of red wine not available. No food apart from a 1/2oz bag of crisps or peanuts. For a two-hour flight something more substantial should be available in First. And nothing else even available for purchase. Staff on board ok. Disappointing apart from the seat comfort and space. I had bought a discounted First class ticket otherwise not worth it. And no access to Delta lounge for First pax unless paid for ($50) or a regular card holder for this service.,6delta-air-lines,22/09/14,I have had several horrible experiences with Delta. One time on my way back from a vacation from Hawaii Delta changed the connecting flight from the Las Vegas Airport to an earlier time. I was not informed until I arrived in Las Vegas only to find out that our connecting flight had already departed. The Delta Customer Service clerk was extremely unhelpful and ended up booking us on a flight that left 5 hours later. I sat in the Las Vegas airport with two small children for several hours. Today I was supposed to fly out to New York at 11.00 am for an important business trip. As I was leaving for the airport I got a call from Delta stating that the flight was delayed until 12.15 pm. Since that phone call the flight has been further delayed three-times. Delta is the worst airline I have ever flown on hands-down with extremely poor customer service.,1delta-air-lines,19/09/14,First time flying Delta was a terrible experience and I will never fly Delta again. Check in was really bad. My seat did not recline and my flight was LA to Sydney it means 15 hours flying in the same position. The seat was near the back of the plane where the flight attendants stay during the flight. They wouldn't close the curtains so it was always with lights on and I could hear them talking and laughing for 15 hours. It was my worst nightmare and I do not recommend Delta to anyone. There was other seats available but they wouldn't give us other seats.,1delta-air-lines,19/09/14,Sep 1 from TYS-DTW-AMS-GVA return on Sep 15 from GVA-AMS-ATL-TYS. Just returned from traveling and used Delta and KLM. My opinion is that Delta has improved its flight services and food on transcontinental flights. Flights were on time customer service was helpful flight attendants were pleasant. The cabin service was much more adequate than in past flights. We did purchase economy comfort seats on the outgoing flight and the extra inches were appreciated. I was very pleased and will continue to use Delta.,10delta-air-lines,19/09/14,IMT-DEN-SAN-IMT. All flights were on time or early. Ground and flight attendants courteous and efficient provided timely and useful info. The seats and entertainment on the new B737 are quite good for economy. Beef sandwich for purchase was at best OK. Beverages passed a few times on a 3 hr SAN-MSP flight. In my opinion Delta provides a good consistent product these days.,8delta-air-lines,19/09/14,Extremely poor service. A family of five flew to Orlando via Detroit. After a lot of hassle on my part I was able to organise the special meals for us on our flight to Detroit. It was expected that the airline would have done so the same for the return flight but this did not happen with the result we were denied this request.,delta-air-lines,17/09/14,Manchester - Atlanta - Quito - August 2014. Flew Delta for the first time in about a decade and was very impressed. Transatlantic flew an old but recently refurbished 767-2 which was clean and comfortable. Was fortunate to get an exit row seat meaning I had lots of leg room and being 6'3 this was a blessing! Seats were a little hard but no more so than other airlines. Entertainment system was very good lots of options and food and drinks were served regularly. Cabin crew were very friendly and always happy to help. Flight departed on time and arrived early in ATL. ATL-QUI - very old 757-2 and desperately needed refurbing. Seats were worn out no entertainment overhead TVs existed but not used and cabin crew were less friendly. Drinks only served once on a 5 hour flight and food was very poor in comparison to the other flight. Standard American airline for me very good transatlantic but domestic/South America used tired fleet and much less effort made. Will certainly use again if I need to fly transatlantic as was an excellent experience but still much to improve on the other side of the pond.,7delta-air-lines,17/09/14,NRT-HNL-NRT in business class both ways. The flight was smooth on time had decent food lie-flat seats and a very accommodating HNL-based crew of FA. No complaints whatsoever. It always amazes me at the negative comments on this review site considering my consistently good experiences with Delta. They're not the best airline in the world but they seem to try their best.,10delta-air-lines,17/09/14,Delta 1487 on 09-04-14 from ATL to JFK. The gate agent addressed my wife and I by name as we boarded. All passengers were greeted by the F/A as they boarded. Flight left a few minutes late but arrived early. The meal consisted of a cold shrimp/chicken platter or a turkey/chicken sandwich which was very good. Service was good. My only complaint is the seating. The seat is more comfortable than Economy Comfort but Delta should add an inch of pitch in the first class cabin. I did not rate the inflight entertainment as there was none available due to the short flight. Delta 2043 first class on 09-11-14 JFK to ATL. Flight left about 30 minutes late due to mechanical problems. The captain gave detailed and many updates concerning takeoff times which was appreciated. The plane was an MD 88. Again no inflight entertainment due to the short flight. Food and beverages included snacks from a basket.,9delta-air-lines,14/09/14,I keep making the mistake of choosing Delta. I flew to Spain recently and now within the us and each time I am unable to be seated with my husband regardless of how in advance I book my tickets. When I just called to inquire about a seat assignment the representative was beyond rude and said if I could not afford the upgrade then I can wait till I get to the gate like always. I have no problem paying for an upgrade but it seems to me they purposely do that so you pay the money or pay by sitting alone! Rude and not accommodating at all.,delta-air-lines,14/09/14,I flew from Omaha to Minneapolis. Minneapolis to Paris. Paris to Yaounde Cameroon. Returning flight from Yaounde was cancelled. Left the following morning. Flew to Central African Republic then to Chad. From Chad to Paris. Once a 6 hour flight turned into almost 13 hours. One meal provided.,delta-air-lines,14/09/14,Flying on 8/25 from EWR to AMS and return on 9/5 ex AMS to EWR in Economy Comfort. Save your money not worth it. Food was horrible. Flight attendance not very polite. Service was non-existent. I asked for an after dinner drink and was told only coffee Tea or water was available. This is not what Delta advertises on Economy Comfort. Have flown many times on Lufthansa to Germany and the service is 100% better. I will stay away from Delta in the future.,2delta-air-lines,09/09/14,July 28 - August 2 2014. DTW to Las Vegas. My husband and I flew Delta this past July (2014) to Las Vegas. I think the staff did a wonderful job. They always offered snacks and drinks. We will definitely fly Delta again.,10delta-air-lines,09/09/14,SEA-LHR and AMS-SEA I had an excellent experience on these international flights with Delta. The seats were relatively spacious and comfortable and the IFE was really impressive. The food was edible and there were frequent drink services. I had a far better experience than I did with Air Canada on similar routes. I will definitely be flying with Delta on future trips to Europe.,8delta-air-lines,09/09/14,I have had a good experience with Delta so I chose to fly it again. We were flying from Philadelphia to Austin Texas. First off my flight was delayed for an hour and a half. Then we took off. My first stop was Minneapolis. We then had another stop for no reason at Detroit. We then finally got to Austin. Our flight left Philadelpiha at 6am CST and got to Austin at 7pm CST. I will never fly Delta again.,1delta-air-lines,09/09/14,Round trip Detroit to Ft Lauderdale 8/28-9/1. Once again Delta has maintenance issues. We missed our connection lose our first class seats and get home 10 hours late. By the way do not purchase first class tickets. Delta apparently can choose to honor them or not. What a waste of money. I chose to purchase rather than upgrade and still lost my seats. The trip down here in first class offered potato chips for lunch and one drink because our flight attendant spent his time talking to another flight attendant that must have been riding for free because she didn't come out of the galley the entire flight. I guess I should just be happy they got us to our destination. Red coats are useless and maintenance is worst as our plane wasn't the only flight delayed that day due to maintenance.,delta-air-lines,06/09/14,Flew MSP-LAX-OGG (Maui) RT and was pleased with Delta in both directions. The flights are long so not terribly comfortable but a very nice attendant suggested that I move to Economy Plus seating for the extra legroom on the outbound to Maui. The food options were tasty and fairly-priced. I appreciated that the crew wore Hawaiian- inspired outfits to put us in a festive mood. Hawaii is such an exceptional destination it deserves the extra touches! Delta is my choice for flights lately because they work hard to deserve my business.,8delta-air-lines,06/09/14,I flew IND-DTW-JFK to connect to an Air China flight to Beijing there and PVG-DTW-IND on the way back. I was originally suppose to fly IND-JFK to connect to Air China but the flight was delayed to after 9am and I would miss the Air China flight by then. So the agent booked me through Detroit. A320 service to Detroit no food because it was only 30 minutes CRJ900 service to JFK had soda and peanuts. On the way back I was supposed to fly Air China PVG-PEK-JFK and Delta to IND. Air China got delayed and they rebooked me on PVG-DTW-IND Boeing 777 to DTW good food had many choices. No food for the DTW-IND flight as usual. Nice flight attendants good seating good entertainment funny safety video.,8delta-air-lines,06/09/14,Flew JFK-MCO on Aug 28 in Economy Comfort. Aircraft ok massive delay on taxi way due to congestion. Cabin crew had no control over passengers - children were running up and down aisle yelling banging on seats including when seat belt sign was on. Crew didn't bat an eyelid even when others were out of their seats on final approach with belt light illuminated. We then flew MCO-LAX on Sep 1. Old tired aircraft with video screens fixed to ceiling. Crew inserting VHS tapes for IFE. Cabin smelt dirty carpet dirty everything. Time to retire the 757 fleet. Economy comfort seats hard and uncomfortable.,2delta-air-lines,06/09/14,Mid August. YYZ-MSP-SMF (Toronto - Minneapolis - Sacramento). Return trip. The economy comfort seats from MSP to SMF were adequate decent legroom acceptable recline. Other than legroom they were not much different from the ones on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection from YYZ to MSP. The plastic armrests from MSP-SMF were very uncomfortable. These seats are similar to the ones on Delta international flights. I will no longer fly Delta on internationally and will try another carrier such as KLM on my next trip to Europe. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food no entertainment offered). The flight attendants were competent and courteous.,3delta-air-lines,06/09/14,My wife and I recently flew first class on Delta Airlines from Seattle to San Diego on flight 5789. The aircraft was a Jet Embraer 175 a plane that I think is very practical comfortable and sensible for a domestic flight. Also there are no middle seats anywhere on this plane. The crew were very friendly and attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and nicely presented and served by our attentive stewardess. We felt this was the best flight we have taken in a very long time and was reminiscent of air travel from the old days. I have been a frequent air traveler for 55 years so I remember the good old days of travel. I contrast this flight with another first class flight on United Airlines where the service and food were horrible and the plane was filthy with a bathroom that was worse than any gas station I ever saw.,10delta-air-lines,06/09/14,Early August flight from SMF - MSP - YYZ (Sacramento - Minneapolis - Toronto). I flew economy comfort on an early flight from SMF to MSP The MSP to YYZ flight was on Endeavor Air / Delta Connection. The economy comfort seats had adequate legroom but almost no recline making it impossible for me to nap (the seat backs had a tilt-your- head-forward built-in headrest). The seats on Endeavour had minimal legroom but more recline and I was able to nap during the two-hour flight to Toronto. The plastic armrests on the SMF-MSP flight were extremely uncomfortable. Economy comfort wasn't worth the money. One star for food and entertainment (I didn't buy food for purchase no entertainment on either flight). My wife has Delta Platinum FF status. Next month we fly to Michigan Amsterdam France and Israel. I'll let her exchange FF miles for my tickets as long as we avoid Delta and fly internationally on a code share airline such as KLM. The FAs on both flights were competent courteous and seemed to care about their passengers. I wish Delta management had the same attitude.,3delta-air-lines,28/08/14,Flew Dublin - JFK return in business elite. Didn't really get that priority feel on check in as you do with most other airlines. Lounge in Dublin ok lounge in JFK terminal 2 is awful. Food is fine and there was plenty of offerings cabin crew very nice seats very comfortable but I think Virgin Etihad and Qatar Airways business class is far better with a classier feel to it. On saying that I would fly with them again.,7delta-air-lines,26/08/14,My husband and I have taken a few trips a year with our kids (now 4 and 3) since they were babies and never had such a terrible experience. Getting to our destination was alright - we booked an overnight flight so that the kids would sleep and ended up with 2 extra seats next to us. Staff were all very polite and helpful. However before our return we were informed by e-mail that our 2 flights with a connection of just over an hour had been cancelled and we had been re-booked on 4 flights - yes 3 layovers to get us from one major airport in the US to another in Canada. My husband spent over an hour on the phone getting this changed and it took a great deal of insisting that 4 flights would not work especially with young kids. Our travel dates were flexible as was the departure airport from Florida but this didn't make a difference. We were finally re-booked on 2 flights with an almost 6 hour layover. We were told that having a layover longer than 5 hours would result in additional fees which we of course refused to pay and Delta reluctantly agreed. On the day of the flight we arrived at our gate to find out that our first flight had been delayed almost an hour and our second flight had been delayed 3 hours. (which now resulted in an 8 hour layover!). The airport staff was extremely accommodating and offered to re book us on a flight early the next morning with a 2 hour layover and cover our hotel expenses for the night. We appreciated the offer but decided to decline because we were already at our departure gate and didn't want to repeat the check in and security process the following day. Sometime during our 8 hour layover we looked at our boarding passes and noticed that none of us were sitting together on our second flight. After putting up with an excessive amount of delays and attitude from Delta over the phone and by e-mail I would have gladly left my then 2 and 4 year olds alone for Delta staff to entertain during the flight but after some insisting on my part we were all seated together.,3delta-air-lines,26/08/14,"Munich - Atlanta - Kalamazoo and returning from Chicago - Atlanta - Munich. My flight to the US was nothing better than the usual - in fact simply average no comment to make. However the adventure begins on my returning flight from Chicago on 30th December. Upon checking in my luggage in Chicago I find out that my flight to Atlanta had been cancelled - apparently for weather reasons. I quickly had customer service representatives put me on an alternative route: Chicago - New York - Prague - Munich. However upon embarking the flight to New York we had technical difficulties and could not take off on time. When we did I had already missed my connection. Knowing about this situation I asked the flight attendant to assist just to be told ""hold on we'll look into it"" or ""you simply ask the ground staff in New York they'll sort you out"". Upon arriving in JFK instead of making my way to the gate I straight went to Delta Customer Services. Getting there it was like being at a fish market - people arguing kids crying and the Delta Customer Service staff simply could not be bothered. When it was my turn I was not greeted I was not asked how I was doing and nor was given the generic apology for delays experienced. After a long discussion I was put on a flight from New York - Frankfurt - Munich. After a couple of hours of transit with no amenities or vouchers provided I got on the flight for Frankfurt - I was put right at the back despite various empty seats. I reached Frankfurt to find out - my ticket was never issued for Munich! However being German speaking and after being handed to competent Fraport staff and discussing the issue with them in detail - the situation was dealt with in an excellent manner and I was on my next flight to Munich. Once I touched down in Munich you can now imagine what is going to come or in fact not going to come - my luggage! Will never travel with them again.",delta-air-lines,26/08/14,Flew CDG-MSP-YYZ. First aircraft was an A330-200 which was somewhat spacious. IFE was excellent but the headphones were not that great. Seats were nice and the blanket and pillow were good. The meals were above averages and were filling. A lot of drink services too. Connection was a breeze as well. The flight after that was a CRJ-900 so it was more cramped and without IFE but the aircraft was new and spotless. Seats and service was OK for a regional flight. Wifi on board but you have to pay. All in all the two flights were pleasant and really surprised me.,8delta-air-lines,20/08/14,MCO-LHR via Atlanta. The internal flight up to Atlanta was surprisingly spacious seating in economy for this short flight. The transatlantic flight from Atlanta to London was on a B767 with a decent seat with good leg room. The IFE offers a good choice to occupy the time and the meal was ok and standard for economy. Delta is a no nonsense airline that does the job you pay for.,7delta-air-lines,20/08/14,Flew MEX-DTW recently on Delta on a nice and fairly clean A319. Economy class seats had decent legroom - inflight wifi was a huge plus but no other IFE was on offer even in business class. Ham and cheese sandwich was served as a snack which surprised me as I expected no food in economy class. Flight arrived and departed on time. Staff were attentive and polite.,8delta-air-lines,18/08/14,Traveled from SYD-LAX return in Economy Comfort on Boeing 777-200. Service was ok but the seats are very hard and uncomfortable. Had a look at the Business class seats when disembarking and they felt just as hard. Really needs refurbishing.,5delta-air-lines,18/08/14,A few months ago I was flying home from Chicago via Minneapolis. I don't really care to connect but Delta had the lowest fares and I was okay with that. The flight to Minneapolis from Chicago was delayed due to a plane issue. The staff on the ground were excellent at handling the issue and on the plane they were helpful as well. Unfortunately this was not the case with the rest of the staff. Upon arrival to Minneapolis I had to run to my gate to make my flight. As I got there I had to argue with the gate attendant about getting my seat. Note I'm a 17 year old who can't book a hotel has nowhere to stay and needs to be on that flight the last one out that night. Thankfully the man gave me his seat and I made it home. Staff on the MSP-MCO leg were very rude. I was very unimpressed. I love Delta but it put a sour taste in my mouth.,6delta-air-lines,18/08/14,We are a family of 6 going on vacation from San Jose California to Las Vegas with a connecting flight in Los Angeles. We missed our flight from San Jose to LA and therefore missed our connecting flight from LA to Vegas and therefore wasted a whole day (1/3 of our trip) in LAX. We missed our flight in San Jose because we did not arrive at the gate until the last 3 min of departing time. However two of our family members arrived at the gate early because they used the handicapped express lane at security point. The family members that arrived early told the gate agent that there are more people coming please wait. The agent was rude did not even page for our names and refuse to wait. By the time the rest of the family got to the gate the plane has already taken off 2min earlier which is 5 min earlier than departing time! This kind of customer service is unacceptable!,delta-air-lines,18/08/14,NRT-ATL in business elite. The aircraft is an old 747 but renovated a few years back with the lie flat seats and if you're in the upper deck very nice indeed. It's quiet two toilets for less than 20 passengers and two flight attendants. The entertainment selection is excellent. My vegetarian meal was OK nothing special but not bad. It was a smooth and comfortable flight. The only complaint I have is about the service. The FA's on US carriers are very familiar and have a jokey attitude that I think most Americans quite enjoy. I have lived overseas for over 20 years and do not like that. I prefer kind polite service without the constant sarcasm and humor.,8delta-air-lines,13/08/14,I was on Delta Flight DL101 from Atlanta to Buenos Aires. The flight took of with some delay and after 2 hours in the air we returned again to Atlanta due to a problem with the plane. The problem came afterwards. We arrived at 4 am our new departure was delayed. Nobody from Delta provided a clear view of what the plan was. 12 hours after our original departure time we were still at the airport and nobody from Delta would give an answer. Last time on a Delta Flight for me.,delta-air-lines,13/08/14,Was scheduled afternoon of 8/11/14 to fly from Lansing MI to Minneapolis then on to DFW. About 2.5 hours before flight received automated call that flight from Lansing had been cancelled and that they would call back with a rebooking (no explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled). Automated call back had put me on a flight out the next day at around 1.30 in the afternoon getting me to Dallas about 5.30pm on 12th. I called back and managed to get rebooked on a flight on the 12th leaving Lansing to Detriot at 6am then on to DFW getting in around 9.20am the next day (an effort to try to salvage most of the work day on the 12th). Arrived to Lansing airport about 4.30am on the 12th only to be told that the 6am flight was also cancelled (again gate agent had no explanation of why the flight was cancelled). Their only option was to put me on the same afternoon flight the automated service had booked me on the previous day. My 80-something year old parents ended up driving me to Detroit to make the 7.28am connection. Complained to Delta and was given a refund of about $29 (which I haven't seen yet). This didn't even cover the cost of the fuel my parents used to get from Lansing to Detroit and back).,2delta-air-lines,13/08/14,Economy LHR-MCO via BOS. First time in 4 years with Delta and I have to say I was impressed. The seat on the 767 out of LHR was fine (and I am a big chap) with good leg room. Flight attendants were professional if not a little unsmiling. Food service was good and drinks complimentary. The IFE was good with a good selection. The internal flight down to MCO was delayed an hour due to bad weather but we made up some time during the flight. For me Delta is a no nonsense service that ticks boxes without the wow factor.,8delta-air-lines,11/08/14,Delta did not notify me of flight cancellation of a direct flight from PHX to JFK airport that was to leave at 8.30 which had been changed previously from 9.30 until we had arrived at the terminal. Put us on a flight to Atlanta Airport transferred to another flight to JFK. After boarding waited for about an hour to find out they could not take off due to weather. We were then put on standby at another Atlanta terminal. We had advised the counter person that we had a doctor's appointment in NY the next morning and needed to get there. In watching the monitor for open seats I noticed they were asking for people that wanted to upgrade to 1st class. We had paid for 1st class round-trip tickets and were not called to fill in those seats. Because I complained about the service we were able to take those seats. We arrived At JFK at about 1.30 am the next day. Because of Delta we paid for a $200 hotel room that we did not use. When leaving JFK on our return trip on Delta we sat on the plane for 1.5 hours for a cap from a baggage handler to be removed from engine that had been sucked into it we finally took off. We should have been treated more courteously and not like a herd of cattle especially as a 1st class ticket holder. We paid for more!,1delta-air-lines,11/08/14,"I flew from Mumbai to Detroit with a layover at Amsterdam with the total flight duration of 18.5 hours. The delta flight from Mumbai left about 1.5 hours late and the flight from Amsterdam to Detroit left 15 mins earlier leaving us stranded at Amsterdam. I was then rebooked to fly from Amsterdam to Chicago and Chicago to Detroit all the direct Detroit flights being overbooked. I had no choice but to take the flight to Detroit the flight from Chicago to Detroit was being taken care of by ""United Airlines"".",3delta-air-lines,11/08/14,July 25 2014 Miami - Atlanta - Asheville return August 3 2014. All flights leaving and returning on time. Clean aircraft. Pleasant flight attendants. Would fly Delta again.,8delta-air-lines,11/08/14,Took a flight from Phoenix AZ to Rochester NY with a plane change in Minneapolis MN. I arrived at Minneapolis 40 minutes between flights so plenty of time then we were told that there will be a delay because of mechanical issues and had to wait for a new plane. While we were waiting at the next gate we found out that plane was also delayed for mechanical issues. The replacement plane finally arrived 2 hours later we boarded and were just about to back out of the gate when the captain announced that we will be delayed for mechanical issues. I arrived 2.5 hours later from my scheduled arrival time. The return trip wasn't any better the plane arrived 2 hours late. I arrived in Atlanta as my connecting flight was taking off. That was the last flight out of Atlanta until the next morning. I got my ticket no problem but when I asked about a hotel. They would only give me a coupon for a reduced rate. I felt I shouldn't have to pay for something g that wasn't my fault. So I got to spend 12+ hours in the terminal. Never flying Delta again.,1delta-air-lines,06/08/14,Flew late July on Delta round trip from Minneapolis to Beijing and back with two layovers in Seattle (SEA to MSP was on Alaska Airlines code share not included in ratings). Booked through travel agency. Overall an enjoyable and satisfactory trip. Only item of note is that a travel companion lost her passport on the MSP to SEA flight and couldn't board the plane to Beijing in Seattle help staff at SEA were very helpful and accommodating they got her passport back and put her on the next flight to Beijing.,8delta-air-lines,06/08/14,"I was almost convinced to switch to Delta from US Airways and United where I have status. For 3 of 4 legs of travel the flight attendants and gate agents were friendly and professional and the service was good. This was my second flight on Delta and I was unfamiliar with their seating protocol. On August 8 Flight 5151 from LGA to CLT I asked a flight attendant if the flight was full and if I could move my seat. She did not refuse. Another flight attendant arrived and the two attendants had a less than professional conversation. She then walked up to me with a flight manage at and asked if I was passenger (name) and then said I could not sit in this seat because these seats were Premium. It was a false show. The first attendant could have asked if I'd like to upgrade to Premium or provided an honest response simply saying ""Unfortunately no."" Honesty integrity and professionalism is important.",3delta-air-lines,02/08/14,Last year I had a flight from Dubai to Atlanta. The flight was supposed to take off at 9.30pm from Dubai. We were told that the flight was delayed 3 hours. At 12.30am they said it was still delayed by 4 more hours. At 4.30 they got everyone onboard and the flight didn't take of until 9am. Then they announced that due to some technical faults the flight was cancelled. We were asked to sit in the Airport Lounge for whole day. After 15 hours the flight took off. Overall the flight was delayed by approx 27 hours. They did not want to provide hotel accommodation the staff were very rude. No one was interested in responding to our questions.,delta-air-lines,02/08/14,GRU-ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW-GRU business class. Very comfortable truly lie-flat seats in 767s for the international legs (maybe not quite as nice as the A330s of US Airways in biz class). My wife had asked for boarding assistance due to an arm injury and she said whenever she made any move on the GRU-ATL leg an attendant was at her side almost immediately. No Delta club at GRU so had to use the somewhat smaller and more basic Gol Airlines club. First class for the ATL-MDW and SEA-DTW legs was your basic domestic first class. Nothing spectacular but fine. Decent selection of movies at least in the 767s.,8delta-air-lines,31/07/14,Flew DEN-JFK then CDG-MSP-DEN in Business. Was pleasantly surprised as I had not travelled DL in about 10 years. Domestic segments decent with excellent service and meals. Crew chatty and actually acted like they wanted to there. CDG-MSP with flat seats on A330. Crew were okay but still miss the class of European carriers and kindness of EK/SQ. No smiles and rather perfunctory service. Food better than AF and seat much better; Entertainment was excellent with big screen and got about 3 hours of good sleep. Only negative was appalling ground staff at JFK- rude surly and could care less. Will avoid JFK as best as I can.,8delta-air-lines,29/07/14,"One thing I find really ironic with Delta Airlines is at the beginning of the safety video they state that ""your comfort and needs are our first priority"" when it's is absolutely not the case it seems like it's the profit Delta can make. I'm not normally one to complain however after flying with Delta 3 times something needed to be said. From LA to NY return and from NY to Honolulu my family were unable to have seating together due to not booking a 'particular way' despite the fact we booked months in advance! It seems this manner of booking was only available to people who booked in USA as no information on booking allocated seats was known to us (Australian origin). Moreover we weren't the only people who encountered this issue. Another passenger was unable to be seated with their 4 and 8 year old children due to their ridiculous seating policy. Do it the right way Delta first checked in first choice. Service was bad. Rude at check in. Rude and unhelpful at the gate and even on flight they held their tradition by attendants having domestic quarrels on the plane around passengers. Food is terrible all flights are over 5 hours and only offered 2 biscuits or a small bag of pretzels unless you pay. Some entertainment also unavailable; however what was available were decent movies. Surprisingly Delta can do something right. Save your time money and hunger for an airline who cares about their passengers needs. This service isn't even worth the $10 you would pay to watch the entertainment available.",1delta-air-lines,29/07/14,ATL to UIO on DL 673. Flight was on an ageing 757. Paid extra for comfort class row 19. Narrow seat due to tray in arm rest. Try was broken and FA could care less. Offered no help. Food of poor quality/taste. Entertainment system from last century. Crew member makes PA announcement for anyone needing the lav to go before they pull the carts. 10 people queue up in front of my seat and wait. Crew fighting with each other over cabin responsibilities. Extended delay in FA picking up dirty trays which sat for almost one solid hour. Bad flight in every regard!,1delta-air-lines,29/07/14,JFK-YUL on Delta Connection embraer regional jet. Terminal 2 at JFK must be the worst place in the world to change planes. After entering the path to the aircraft it became worse as the metal tunnel seemed to be falling to bits loose floor and walls looked like they had been run over several times. Inflight service was dire and not at mainline airline standard - inflight entertainment consists of the safety briefing and looking out the window. Inflight snack service consists of biting your own fingernails. Although flight was early this level of service is what I expect from cheap airlines like Ryanair not those charging a premium price. Look for alternatives.,2delta-air-lines,27/07/14,My latest flight on Delta was PHL-MSP-AMS-ARN-AMS-JFK-PHL. Why such a circuitous route to Stockholm? Delta's service: I seem to be the lucky person who gets a great flight crew (even when in Coach) good food and on time departures. The upgrade of the business cabin to business elite with lie flat beds was a great way to fully relax and get quality sleep. Even though I am now based in USAIR/American country I still fly Delta - and know a lot of great people in all of their hubs. Only drawback is their very restrictive FF program. But day to day I would rather have a good flight experience over using my miles to upgrade.,8delta-air-lines,22/07/14,Flight DL0056 Detroit to Heathrow: Passenger console did not work neither reading light nor audio/visual entertainment. For almost 7 hours I had nothing to do as I could not read or watch video. I asked for assistance but received no help or offer to move me to another seat.,2delta-air-lines,22/07/14,"Flight 1545 on July 18 did not have the full snack loaded for the first class passengers. So they served a ""fruit plate"" complete with pickle to go with the absent sandwich. Beware of first-class seats. The front rows do not have any place to put your feet. You pay a lot for a seat with little leg room.",2delta-air-lines,22/07/14,Frankfurt - JFK on a B763. Very good experience: Nice seat pitch (for comparable ranks) cheerful and attentive service tasty meal and punctual take off.,9delta-air-lines,17/07/14,My experience with Delta was extremely frustrating. I bought 3 tickets from Milan to Denver with stop in Atlanta. One month before departure Delta changed the itinerary in Milan-JFK-Minneapolis-Denver which was exactly what I was not looking for (2 stops rather than 1). Too late to change tickets because of high prices. From NY we took off more than 2 hours late most time spent inside a super hot aircraft on a taxiway and consequently we were not able to get the flight from Minneapolis to Denver. Rescheduled for the next day we were forced to spend the night in the airport because the customer service horrible was not able to find a room in Minneapolis. Next day we took off late again.,1delta-air-lines,15/07/14,Flew from Amsterdam to Boston DL267 Economy Comfort service was excellent FA's chatted and were very kind. I have noted that past reviews of Delta are not very good but that seems to be inter-American and not Delta's international flights. The Comfort seats have plenty of leg-room and are very good for a 7 hour flight and as they are just behind Business Class you de-board very quickly ! Flight back DL266 was just as good so I will be telling everyone to fly Delta.,10delta-air-lines,12/07/14,Flew from Atlanta to Las Vegas return for business convention. Smooth on time flight both ways excellent service and professional staff. On the flight back we sat on the tarmac for an extra 10 minutes or so. The pilot then proceeded to the runway. On the way he explained that he requested an alternate route out of Las Vegas since he wanted to avoid storm clouds and turbulent weather. I'm a nervous flyer and I was very impressed that Delta will actually do this. I'm sure it affected there on time statistics and probably cost Delta more in fuel expenses to take an alternate route. I will fly Delta from now on.,10delta-air-lines,10/07/14,Business Elite MSP-SEA-PEK-SEA-MSP. All Sectors were excellent. International Service was fine. Food was good. All Flights were on time and had a chance to use the new immigration Kiosk's. It was a little faster. Not sure why but got a hand written note from the purser thanking me for my business. I see a definite improvement with Delta. I hope it continues.,10delta-air-lines,10/07/14,No more pre-boarding for passengers with children really? On a recent flight my family was instructed that Delta no longer allows passengers with small children to pre-board because there is now a pre-board fee that passengers are paying and 'got upset' that others were allowed to do so for free. This is yet another example of how Delta airlines are cutting service and delaying the overall boarding process. As a business owner and traveler I understand the desire to make money but this is going too far! Going forward I will research flights and airlines that are willing to accommodate my traveling family. My extra dollars will be well spent on an airline that values service first and foremost.,5delta-air-lines,08/07/14,I've flown Delta about 15-20 times. 90% of those trips have been work trips where I've not been given the option of flight provider. My current trip to Alaska from PHL leaves me without either of my bags because the Delta connecting flight out of MSP was 45 minutes delayed. Why was it delayed? Because they needed to kick 8 people off due to weight. This makes me wonder if they knew where they were flying before we got on. How can this oversight occur? Either way when I arrived in Anchorage to catch the connecting flight I had to run across the airport to make my flight with no time to spare. My bags didn't make it. Well now it's the next day and they can't confirm when my bags will arrive.,delta-air-lines,08/07/14,My flight was delayed not for any weather or mechanical issue but because the captain of our plane decide not to show up to fly us. It has been almost double the flight time itself waiting in the terminal. This is completely unacceptable and I am disappointed with Delta who have always been a dependable airline. The remainder of staff handled it very well but I lost a lot of faith in Delta Airlines today.,delta-air-lines,08/07/14,Flew DL #231 from Amsterdam to Boston on July 6 and I have to say that it was a great flight. On time departure early arrival. Very tasty meal (Thai chicken) perfectly adequate amount of food. Nice snacks first an ice cream then a sandwich. I really appreciate the large bottle of water everyone gets after the meal service. Inflight service was very efficient though I think the flight attendants could have smiled a bit more. Seat size and pitch were comfortable and I'm not a small person. Inflight entertainment was outstanding - a huge choice of movies both new releases and older classics - that I really didn't want the flight to end. Perhaps I'm just easily pleased but I found this Economy Class experience to be very good.,10delta-air-lines,08/07/14,SFO-ATL on June 27 apparently an equipment change where I went from exit row aisle to row 45 next to the toilet. Not bad for a platinum 2 million miler! Finally found a gate manager who helped fix the problem but none of the front line employees can make a decision.,1delta-air-lines,06/07/14,Flight 718. This flight was booked almost one year ago. All 15 family members had seats together. Now we are leaving in a few days and guess what? Three members of our family have had their seats changed. When asked to give us back our original seats the representative supervisor stated they could not accommodate our request. They stated they have the right to change any seat. Well why can't they do the right thing and accommodate their customer and give us back our original seats and move the passengers to our new unwanted seats.,1delta-air-lines,06/07/14,Flew BOG-JFK-BOG. Check in at both ends flawless both flights left on time and arrived before schedule which I think is a great achievement. Service was good breakfast on the BOG-JFK very poor meal on the JFK-BOG was much better. Seats were uncomfortable but we had a great price for our tickets.,8delta-air-lines,06/07/14,Daughter took a flight from RDU-LAX. Flight attendant asked her to move her seat to accommodate a family who wanted to sit together then gave her a seat that didn't recline. It was unfortunate because a) by the time she realized she'd been duped the flight was taking off - and b) she just started flying and didn't know her rights as a passenger. My daughter did the airline a huge favor and got duped. It's a shame since my husband is an elite member who has been raving about Delta's supposed great service.,delta-air-lines,06/07/14,My experience started in Chicago on a flight bound for Phoenix via Minneapolis and a weather delay in Minneapolis. The experience quickly went from bad to abysmal after being delayed in Chicago. The flight crew could not help anyone with connections in Minneapolis. Although it was still afternoon the 800 number people were unable to come up with any alternate route. After nearly 4 hours of delay which included all the passengers deplaning we were loaded onto the plane after the gate next to us with a later flight going Minneapolis loaded. My flight to Phoenix which had also been delayed due to weather left 30 minutes before I got there and had our flight gone first as it should have I probably would have made my connection. But the Delta personal were unable or unwilling to deal with passenger issues like this. Instead I bunked down in the Minneapolis airport overnight. Meals were not provided even though all the restaurants in the airport were closed or closing when we arrived. The next day after 27.5 hours of travel I arrived in Phoenix but one of my bags did not. So while I understand that weather happens this airline has an appalling lack of kindness consideration or concern about getting people and their luggage to their destination.,delta-air-lines,06/07/14,"I bought a First Class ticket on Delta from Detroit to Newark. I'm on my third day of attempting to get there. There were endless delays and finally cancellation of the flights the first two days. I was on standby for two morning flights which took off. Delta was upgrading passengers on both flights and left me in the lurch. Passengers were getting information about further delays before the Delta agents were. Delta wasn't responsible for the cancellation of the flights but they didn't do anything to get me to my destination in a timely fashion. The ticket I got for today's flight is in coach which is OK with me as long as I get to my destination. Later I got what Delta called a ""complementary upgrade"" - and I'm thinking complementary nothing I paid for a first class ticket. The only thing Delta is excellent at is the phrase everyone at Delta seems to have been trained to use (hence insincere): We apologize for the inconvenience.",delta-air-lines,30/06/14,Traveled many times with Delta and so far one airport layover stay due to delays which was fine at first until this time around. Had to stay overnight in Atlanta. Customer service is horrible. Flight times change a lot. One time I had to change an existing flight but the flight that I changed to got canceled. I do not understand why I couldn't get a reimbursement for the change fee when the flight that I wanted doesn't even exist anymore. Now that I know better I'd rather pay for a more reliable airline than stick with cheaper fares for essentially a game of chance. Will avoid this airline in the future.,2delta-air-lines,30/06/14,Flew Delta first class from Atlanta to San Francisco quite possibly the worst flight crew ever more interested in talking to each other than helping passengers one flight crew tried to give my blazer to 2 separate passengers before it got to me unacceptable when you pay to fly first. Cramped seating did not help matters either. A very unpleasant flight.,3delta-air-lines,30/06/14,Delta is extremely frustrating to deal with! We took a family vacation to Alaska. There were 8 of us and we had two stops each way. I reserved seats when I booked the flights. When I checked in online for every flight for all 8 of us I found that all of the seats had been changed for every flight! We were on a family vacation and I picked seats for a reason. The answer I got every time I called was that they switch planes a lot and the seats don't match. I can't imagine that all of the planes were changed! I hope that I never have to fly Delta again! They need to take lessons from Alaska and Southwest!,1delta-air-lines,30/06/14,Marked difference in quality and service between transatlantic and domestic flights travelled Dublin to PDX and back via ATL and both transatlantic legs progressed well with excellent service and no delays while both internal flights were delayed onboard service was spotty at best and boarding was sheer pandemonium. I have never appreciated Ryanair more than after my first experience trying to board a domestic flight in the US.,5delta-air-lines,25/06/14,Short flight Shanghai to Narita. Very well done. 777 Business Elite has an odd layout can't see out window even in window seat without craning neck. Other than that comfortable nice breakfast and excellent professional crew. Bring that style to domestic flights and Delta will succeed.,9delta-air-lines,25/06/14,Delta 2366 JFK to MSP. Delayed for broken plane - we were in line to take off when they decided a broken panel light warranted fixing. We had no gate to return to at JFK so we went to the maintenance lot and were bussed back to the terminal. Had to wait for a new plane (another hour). Re-boarding pandemonium. Most frustrating was waiting another hour on the tarmac before taxi-ing await from gate for catering. this was around 11.30am. We got nothing to eat drink except one bottle of water. Arrived MSP around 12.30am. Pretty awful. Stewardesses standing around on their cell phone. Skip Delta if you have the chance.,2delta-air-lines,25/06/14,Flights in purchased domestic first class with changeover in Minneapolis. Lots of weather delays and was kept well informed and phone conversations with customer service were pleasant. The first three legs of the journey were nothing special. Notably the quality of the product purchased was only that of a larger seat. Inflight service was casual at best and I would not call it friendly. We were tolerated and it kind of felt like we were an inconvenience. The last flight however had a flight attendant who was service oriented and actually took care of the customer properly and a meal was served. To me this tells me that there is a quality issue at Delta. The inflight service product is not consistent.,4delta-air-lines,25/06/14,The CRJ 700 service from Halifax to La Guardia in New York is a quick 90 min hop. The economy seats are cramped but they are on all the Canadair regional jets in economy class. I got my drink. I got my pretzels. And other than that the flight was completely uneventful. This is when you realise flying has become a complete commodity. Now how could we change that?,6delta-air-lines,25/06/14,"This flight was in ""Business Elite"" between Austin Texas and Buenos Aires Argentina with an intermediate stop in Atlanta Georgia. The outbound trip was in early February 2014 and the return was in mid February 2014. Measured against other US carriers international performance Delta was exceptional. Measured against other international carriers their comparative performance was at the least ""competitive"". Other than one sort of ""rough around the edges"" male flight attendant on the return trip the entire experience was quite acceptable.",8delta-air-lines,20/06/14,Flew Mar 30 NRT to BKK. All flights were great. Flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was great. Apart from the meals - some Thai passengers cannot eat beef so the flight crews tried to ask other passengers who could eat beef and changed the meals around. We feel disappointed with their food services.,7delta-air-lines,18/06/14,Flight 2463 leaving West Palm Beach (PBI) at 2.42pm on June 15 arriving at New York LaGuardia (LGA) at 5.30pm. I was slated to take flight 3997 from LaGuardia to Pittsburgh (PIT) leaving at 6.59pm arriving in Pittsburgh at 8.35pm. Every time I fly Delta I end up getting stuck in whatever airport my layover is for 12+ hours due to cancellations or delays. There is no attempt to accommodate me the customer with a hotel for the night a partial refund or even a blanket or pillow for my extended stay in the airport.,delta-air-lines,17/06/14,Delta Website froze 4 times trying to set up flight to three different locations. Had to call and set up over the phone only to find out at the curb our flights were changed with no coumarin to us. My pregnant wife and I sat for over an hour (on the curb) for them to correct the error. We flew to our next location to find the same issue with boarding. We sat outside the line for a half hour while they tried to correct before the plane flew off. I spoke to Delta and they said because of the economy they are having issues. This does not explain why they couldn't send us an e-mail showing our flights changed with new boarding passes. The worst flying experience ever. They could care less about you even if you need special attention. Check baggage fees - Delta packs the plane and charges outrageous prices for additional bags.,delta-air-lines,16/06/14,"I just returned from a round-trip First/Business Elite FLL-ATL-MUC-ATL-FLL trip. I really must say that all the flights were great. Every flight was on-time the flight crews were exceptionally good the in-flight entertainment was good but could be improved the meals were good and tasty. I only wish Delta would update its meal service and add some new items. Going over to MUC the man behind me even commented to the flight attendant ""Is it the usual?"" It is always steak chicken breast pasta (no meat or fish - just pasta) and a cold plate. I've written to DL about adding fish lamb duck etc. to the rotation. (They actually had lamb on the MUC-ATL flight!) Even flight attendants say that every time they have ""fish"" it is the most ordered by passengers. I guess Michelle Bernstein has run out of ideas. That is my only suggestion to improve things in Business Elite: Get more imaginative on the meal offerings! It really isn't that difficult.",9delta-air-lines,16/06/14,"Round-trip flight from Quito Ecuador to Birmingham Alabama with one stop in Atlanta. The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta. The delta gate agents went through 3 security procedures before we even lined up to go to the plane. I think it was the airport's rules. I flew a Delta 757-200 to Atlanta on a red-eye flight. We took off around 11.40 pm and we started flying over the Pacific Ocean. There was no personal entertainment on this type of aircraft so we were forced to watch a movie. They started serving ""breakfast"" around 1.20 am. ""Breakfast"" was a cold turkey and mayonnaise sandwich fruit and a brownie. They took they tray away and we did not eat anything else. Around 5.00 am we started our descent into Atlanta. The landing was smooth and we soon de-boarded and headed through immigration to board our next 56 min flight to Birmingham. Atlanta airport is very confusing as to where restaurants and lounges are. We boarded our MD88 to Birmingham. Since it was an hour flight they should have served us something but the didn't. We landed in Birmingham smoothly.",7delta-air-lines,16/06/14,Narita - Bangkok June 13 Business Elite 747. Slight delay due to hold for other delayed inbound flights but all in all an excellent flight. Chief Purser was an experienced friendly (old school) gentleman who worked hard to insure good service. Seat was a comfortable lie flat pod offering more privacy than the first class American 777 I had just connected from. Decent food with even a light second offering before landing. Excellent entertainment options offered. I would certainly do this again.,9delta-air-lines,13/06/14,Flight from NY La Guardia to Cleveland OH at 01.15am email said flight would be delayed by 2 hours. Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation. Advice don't travel with them if you can avoid them.,delta-air-lines,13/06/14,Originally I had a 2 hour layover. Delta changed our flights to a 4 hour layover. The plane now has been delayed another 20 minutes so my family of 6 and I are at the airport right now for a 4.5 hour layover. This is not acceptable Delta should do something about this. Fly with an airline that cares. It's surely not Delta!,delta-air-lines,12/06/14,We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.,4delta-air-lines,12/06/14,"I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely. Not sure if this is a sign of better things to come from Delta or by the fact that the route is brand new for them but it was a great flight.",9delta-air-lines,10/06/14,I was a bit stubborn about flying Delta for the first time since I'm a fan of Frontier and I don't fly very often about once every three to four years. I took flight 1531 from MSP to BWI and I was very impressed. We left on time and the crew was friendly. After this experience I am very eager to fly Delta again.,10delta-air-lines,09/06/14,JFK-LHR. Had a great on time flight out of JFK with Delta. I found the service friendly and food was great. Constantly coming through the cabin with refreshments certainly not dehydrated at the end of the flight. Only criticism was when we were coming in to land into London the cabin crew did not ask passengers to raise their closed window blinds which made me feel a little unsafe sitting in the middle seats as I couldn't see what was going on outside during landing. The flight attendant told me after it's not US policy to raise the window blinds Delta why not just make it part of your safety policy. Would fly them again.,10delta-air-lines,08/06/14,My wife and I fly frequently and over the last couple of years have found ourselves on Delta a couple of times. Each of the prior trips found delays once missing a connecting flight due directly to the incompetence of Delta personnel. I wrote this off I. The past but today is the final straw. We flew from San Antonio to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Milan for a long awaited vacation. As we were boarding the 767 in Atlanta I noticed the port engine nacelle was open. Once we were buckled in the captain announced that maintenance was waiting on a part and it would take up to an hour to depart. An hour goes by and they have the part but they can't get it installed. Another hour goes by. They're still trying to fix it. More excuses more delays. Never again Delta this was strike three!,delta-air-lines,08/06/14,DL 1134 PBI-ATL. Great ground experience. Inbound flight late prior to equipment arrival gate agents asked for volunteers to check baggage at no charge to destination to speed up boarding and ease overheads. Turn around was 25 minutes gate arrival-departure. Plane was clean crew greeted boarding passengers with genuine smiles. They assisted loading overheads with no attitude. In flight they chatted with passengers. Crew even made the cart in aisle/trip to lav a pleasant game of I move/you move. I was in a time warp. Flying was fun. Three more flights on Delta that week were routine but what an experience this one flight was.,10delta-air-lines,05/06/14,Our flight from Fairbanks to Minneapolis was a great flight with great service. On our return flights the service was great. However the flight was very hot. Multiple passengers complained and nothing was done on 2 separate flights. Given a choice I will not fly Delta again I didn't appreciate the two four hour sauna flights. I was dressed in sandals shorts T shirt.,delta-air-lines,04/06/14,On May 22 after a 6-hour delay 5 alerts and us waiting with hope at the terminal flight 5030 to Atlanta was canceled. And as per airport security and Delta counter the flight was canceled due to radar failure. This cancellation caused us to miss our connecting flight to Lima Peru. On same day Delta re-booked flight to Atlanta departing from another airport and for a later time. To get to this airport cost us $175.00. However once at the airport we begged to Delta to get us on a flight to Lima Peru instead Delta personnel there and over the phone made a mockery of our request by pretending to help us when in reality they were just wasting our time. In the meantime our newly re-booked flight was delayed for approximate 3 hrs and we arrived to Atlanta at midnight. Next day on 05/23 we finally traveled to Lima Peru but it was too late. We will never consider Delta for future travel.,delta-air-lines,02/06/14,Considering how Delta Airlines was an American Air carrier I initially wasn't expecting much and imagined that service would be mediocre sort of like Air Canada but to my surprise my Delta experience was great! Staff were polite the flights were punctual with my returning flight from MSP-YVR being about 15 minutes late due to a computer that needed replacement. Other than the fact that they should really replace/refurbish those A319s my flight was very pleasant.,9delta-air-lines,01/06/14,Travelled MSP-LHR AMS-MSP in May 2014. Flights were on time. Flight attendants responsive enough and food was okay. Economy comfort seats provide decent legroom. I travel with Delta quite a bit and rarely have problems. They get you to your destination reliably for a decent price.,9delta-air-lines,28/05/14,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 in Business on May 17 angled seats with ample leg room excellent service then onward to HNL on a 757-300 in First: seats comparable to Premium Economy as far as the leg room goes poor recline the service was excellent though large screen IFE good food and drinks. May 25 HNL-LAX on an aged 767-200 in First same poor seat recline but good food and service old-style IFE. May 26 LAX-NYC on a 767-300ER Business Elite outstanding newly refurbished cabin flat bed seats outstanding food and service. The only complaint - never - ending turbulence but that was not airline's fault of course. To sum up Delta's First Class is not worth the money I will stick to premium economy instead in the future and the Business Elite is simply outstanding for a Domestic flight.,7delta-air-lines,27/05/14,Third long haul flight with Delta LHR-ATL-TPA-ATL-LHR all flights on time first transatlantic flight they run out of food selections so only had pasta left which looked rather unappetising. Good selection of movies and games on the long haul flights seats were comfortable with good legroom. My only gripe is Atlanta airport why do you have to queue to go through security after getting off an international flight to connect with your next plane not Deltas fault but never had to do this before.,9delta-air-lines,25/05/14,LHR-JFK (Virgin) then JFK-DTW with Delta Connection (Returned on the same route and carriers 10 days later. Held up at JFK both ways for 12 hours due to weather not Delta's fault but our return connection to LHR was rebooked without our knowledge due to our late departure from DTW. This resulted in a rush to try and make the connection only to be told we were off the flight and rebooked for the following morning. Delta then did not issue us with the correct tickets resulting in a 4am nailbiter with Virgin check in as they tried to figure our what Delta had done. I am trying to plan my next trip to DTW to avoid Delta connections due to this.,2delta-air-lines,23/05/14,Travelled to London with my mom JFK-LHR via a Boeing 767-400ER on DL 403 which was an evening flight. Everything went very pleasant from food service to inflight entertainment seat comfort and cabin crew as well as cabin cleanliness. My complain would be our return flight which was rather a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The Cabin was not clean and very narrow bathrooms have some odor and seats were comfortable even for a seven hour flight. Everything else went ok the crew looked exhausted and smiled less they were friendly and very caring. Also to mention food portions are quite small and selections must be thought carefully. If it was not for their 767-300 plane everything went very well. I prefer better other airlines notably American British Airways and Virgin Atlantic as a better option for economy especially with AA's B777-200ER which was their major upgrade.,7delta-air-lines,19/05/14,"Very disappointed with Delta Airlines. I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time. Pleased with the flight crew and flight attendants kudos to them for positive attitudes. However I don't think I will be flying with delta anytime soon.",4delta-air-lines,19/05/14,"Boy are we never going to fly Delta ever again. Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta  they warned us before we booked with them. I heard many people at the various airports we were at saying they will never fly Delta again and I agree.",2delta-air-lines,18/05/14,YUL-JFK-NRT-HKG. It was my first time flying Delta. I usually fly Japan Airlines or any other Asian airlines because of all the bad experiences I had with US based Airlines. From the check in agent I was greeted with a big smile. The planes were clean flight attendants full of energy and smile. To my surprise the captain apologize for the slight delay we had from JFK to Narita. That is something you hear only on Asian Airlines. The seats were comfortable for economy and the food was great!,9delta-air-lines,17/05/14,Worst experience ever! Cancelled our connecting flight out of JFK leaving us stranded at their hell hole of a terminal for 20 hours and telling us that the next available flight was almost 3 days later. Employees spent their time sleeping chatting with one another or doodling on notepads. Bathrooms were disgusting. Every employee gave us different and conflicting information or showed no interest in helping us at all. Lost our bag and then told us that they wouldn't ship it to us we had to drive back to our final airport destination and pick it up. I will never fly with Delta ever again.,1delta-air-lines,17/05/14,Return leg of a paid first class ticket LAS-ATL-GSO. Seemed like circumstances were lining up to give my wife and I a major headache - Bad weather on the East Coast late (mechanical not weather) departure from LAS tight connection in ATL and no seats ex LAS going anywhere East. Helpful agent and supervisor booked hotel in ATL in case we misconnected but we didn't need to have worried a fine tailwind got us to ATL in time for our connection. Newer planes on these 2 legs; the aircraft on the LAS-ATL leg even had a rudimentary IFE system. However my joy was short lived as my headphone jack didn't work and I was denied the opportunity to watch reruns of a few TV programs. Food was fair (basically the same as the outbound journey) seat comfortable service attentive ground staff throughout helpful and efficient. I'll stick with Delta through this purple patch they are enjoying.,7delta-air-lines,17/05/14,"All flights delayed some due to weather others to ""no staff for flight crew"". Missed all connection flights. Help desk staff extremely rude and condescending especially in JFK. Will never ever fly this airline again. Info given by crew 10 min before landing late regarding new gate and terminal incorrect.",2delta-air-lines,16/05/14,"I just tried Delta's ""Business Elite"" from JFK to BOG on a 737-700 and what a ripoff! These ""premium"" seats offer a pitch of just 37 inches (that's less than JetBlue's premium economy); they also recline quite a bit and the result is a wedge experience which made for one of the most uncomfortable flights I can remember. I couldn't even open my computer until my neighbor decided to join his wife in much more comfortable bulkhead coach. Soft service was fine and dinner actually surprisingly good accompanied by a decent German Riesling. But seating comfort is still paramount and this was unacceptable.",1delta-air-lines,16/05/14,The gate experience is good with staff pointing the way. This is especially good at Paris DeGaulle where there are endless gates and lines and confusion. Once on board the experience lessens as the attendants seemingly are frequently tired and occasionally indifferent. I have never been hot (not warm but hot as in a cabin temp of the high 70's) on an overseas flight. A request to a attendant brought the equivalent of a sleepy shrug. The food is edible and the presentation tries to be quality but it falls flat with the quality of the food and the occasional rush to serve and clear. I hate the business class pods - ok for the sleeper or someone doing work but impossible to talk or interact at all with a companion. Baggage handling is excellent for sky priority. Delta clubs vary from seedy (JFK) to nice. Nothing as nice as the Air France clubs at Paris CDG.,7delta-air-lines,16/05/14,Paid for 1st class GSO-ATL-LAS. Delta continues to do a good job in their attempt to be a cut above the other Legacy airlines? Flights were on time check in and boarding easy food good. Service prompt and efficient if not jaunty. The flaw in the program in my view is the age and features of the equipment. DL's policy is to fly them until they run out of hours and our sky veterans had amassed 51 years between them! No IFE on either flight an ugly and not overly comfortable first class seat and 25 year old bathrooms - my ongoing pet peeve with DL.,7delta-air-lines,12/05/14,I flew from YYZ to Detroit to Seoul I was sceptical at first flying Delta because of all the negative reviews. I am very pleased with the whole experience. Enough leg room great entertainment system and great food. I love the snack bags in the middle of the night and bottles of water. Little details really makes a huge difference the ear plug and eye cover warm wipes and cold wipes after boarding and when you wake up. Even the washroom is roomy. Flight attendants are efficient. I will definitely try to fly Delta whenever I can.,10delta-air-lines,08/05/14,Flew PDX to AMS. Flight departed slightly late but actually arrived early. At check-in I enquired as to whether I could pay to upgrade myself to business class but they said they don't have such a program for last minute upgrades which was rather odd as other airlines regularly do it for a fee. Having said that in many ways I was glad I didn't as my normal economy seat was extremely comfy with loads of personal space. Delta has the best inflight entertainment system I have used with a massive selection of entertainment. Having said that they really need to do something about their meals as they were awful and almost as bad as Air Canada. I didn't eat my main course as it smelt awful food but was supposed to be beef stroganoff. The food was the only thing to let Delta down as their cabin crew were friendly and efficient making sure we had regular supplies of water to keep us hydrated. Id definitely fly Delta again but would order a special meal to see if said meal would be better.,9delta-air-lines,06/05/14,Flying to Detroit From Tampa on a 737-800. Service on the plane: it was a good experience. Flight Attendants were polite and cared about me and other passengers (unlike United and BA). Food was only pretzels and cookies and a drink of choice (it was only a 2hr flight). Seats were comfortable. Service in the airport-Good service no long lines and friendly airport crew! I enjoyed Delta and will fly them again!,10delta-air-lines,05/05/14,"DCA-ATL-DCA MD-90; Economy. ""We love to fly and it shows"" used to be Delta's slogan. Standards have slipped a lot since then. DCA counter bag drop-off was prompt after online check-in and the outbound flight was on time. It is amazing how many seats they have crammed into this aircraft recently to make money from Economy Comfort seats. The seat itself is reasonably comfortable for about two hours but the reduced legroom is awful. I am average height so I feel for taller people. Both planes were very clean and appeared well-maintained for 18+ year-old aircraft. A drink and mini pretzles were served on both flights. ATL bag drop-off after online check-in was quite quick. The inbound flight was delayed by 75 minutes but they made-up 25 minutes of that lost time. Flight attendants outbound were friendlier than those inbound. Overall this type of service will be acceptable for two to three hour flight segments and I will use Delta again.",6delta-air-lines,04/05/14,We flew from Atlanta to Portland the check in process was chaotic and disorganized. We had checked in online but had not printed our boarding passes. One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful. On a positive note our plane landed on time and our luggage was there too.,5delta-air-lines,04/05/14,Flew MAN-ATL-HNL and LIH-LAX-ATL-MAN in Business Elite/First. Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early. Refreshments on the two First segments were acceptable and excellent on Business Elite. The staff on all flights were very attentive.,8delta-air-lines,04/05/14,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.,delta-air-lines,04/05/14,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers.,2delta-air-lines,03/05/14,Flight DL0187 Date: Apr 25 2014. More expensive than other airlines. Lunch was served at 10am GMT 2 hours after departure! They had a lot of time to serve it later as we still had more than 5 hours ahead (going to Boston MA USA). You had to pay for entertainment. Many empty seats in first row but you cannot take them without paying extra! Attendant was chatting too much and very loudly and I couldn't sleep. Many broken seats won't come back to straight vertical position. They didn't have any diet or light soda but Fresca.,3delta-air-lines,03/05/14,Flight 67 to Atlanta connecting to flight 1384 to Orlando on April 28. My mother returned home from Zurich to Orlando after visiting us in Europe. Unfortunately while here she spent time in the hospital. Various Delta employees with whom we were in contact were extremely helpful in rebooking flights and assisting her before during and after her flights including wheelchair support. She enjoyed the flight (in economy comfort) the service the food etc. As a family we have flown Delta during many years and continue to be impressed with the airline more so recently with the many improvements they have and are implementing. We will happy continue to recommend Delta airlines.,10delta-air-lines,03/05/14,Just returned from: IND to SJU via ATL. First class on IND-ATL segments (MD 90) and so-called Business Elite on ATL-SJU segments (737-800). On all segments aircraft interiors were clean and well maintained and cabin attendants were good. Boarding on all flights was total chaos and food on the ATL-SJU segments was inedible. No food on other segments. Seats not what one would call comfortable or roomy. Not worth the price paid.,5delta-air-lines,03/05/14,April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each).,1delta-air-lines,01/05/14,The food was disgusting and the fact that I was travelling from the UK to the USA and there was no entertainment was horrendous. My kids had to look at the front of a seat for 8 hrs and my daughter had to sit on my lap but she could not sit properly because there was no space. When we got given food it kept going everywhere because we were so squashed. The loos were dirty and small. The staff were no good they didn't help out. I wouldn't recommend them.,delta-air-lines,30/04/14,Flew Atlanta to Seattle. It is a 5 hour flight. If you want to eat you have to buy your meal however they do not have enough sandwiches so when the cart got to the end of the plane there was nothing left. If you want to watch a movie you have to pay $6.00. It costs $30.00 to check each bag. Just be aware that the price you pay for your ticket is just to get you from a to b just like greyhound.,2delta-air-lines,29/04/14,Flew from LAX-ATL on B777-200 then ATL-CMH on A319. Both legs were great and crew very attentive. First class seat on the B777 was a comfortable seat if somewhat difficult to settle into at first. The A319 was uncomfortable and took a while to find that special spot to get comfortable. All considered the service I got for what I paid was excellent. Bags were first off the carousel and waiting when I got there which I liked a lot. Only issue was the miserable check in lady in LAX. DL also need to re think their lounge policy for First class passengers.,10delta-air-lines,28/04/14,The review is for Delta which was our return flight home from Pittsburgh. We were to leave on Flight DL 5217 on 20 April. Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter. Because we booked with Expedia they said that they Delta was not to blame (they blamed United). Worst case of passing the buck ever! (Only bright spot were the front line staff - like the desk agents who remained 3 hours extra to rebook all the passengers).,2delta-air-lines,28/04/14,MAN-Atlanta Atlanta-Memphis Memphis-Las Vegas Las Vegas-Salt Lake City Salt Lake City-Memphis Memphis- Detroit Detroit-Amsterdam April 2014. All of our America trip was with Delta and everyone was excellent in every way. From check in to boarding to seat leg room were superb. The pilot and cabin crew were so friendly the captain thanked everyone on each flight personally standing at the entrance with the cabin crew. 7 out of our 8 holiday flights were with delta and we had no problems with any one was with KLM see that review.,10delta-air-lines,27/04/14,Travelled Dublin to Salt Lake return trip. I normally travel BA which is good but in comparison Delta is a horrible travel experience. The flight attendants are fine but the aircraft used on all four segments were very old and there was a 'domestic' feel to flight that you just don't get with BA which in comparison has newer and cleaner and more spacious aircraft. Perhaps the biggest issue was that Delta typically fly 757 aircraft compared to BA's use of 747 or A380. It just felt far too cramped for long haul. The biggest insult was having paid > $2000 for a return flight to being given a 'beaker' of 100% plonk despite having asked for 'red wine'. I really wanted a glass of wine but if there was a plant nearby I would have dumped it there it was absolutely foul - I'm not a wine snob and would drink anything reasonable but this drink poured from a large container was sickening. I'd fly Delta again but only as a last resort. Having said that the flights were all on time or early maybe lucky but I'd hate to be delayed if the only wine they had onboard in 'coach' was what they gave me on those flights. One more thing although they had VOD the content on offer was very limited with only a handful of movies on offer (in contrast BA usually offer > 30 movies with similar ratios for TV and Music).,5delta-air-lines,27/04/14,Flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville NC canceled due to mechanical problem. Their solution was to spend the night in Atlanta at our cost and fly to Jacksonville 20 hours later. Ended up fling to Raleigh and renting a car at our cost and driving to Jacksonville. They are not concerned in the least. Will avoid Delta in the future.,delta-air-lines,22/04/14,Flight from MSN to LGA going east was very good. Return west was very poor with cancellation of late night flight and re-booking for next morning and long (2.5 hours) delay on morning flight due to a mechanical problem after plane was loaded and de-icing equipment issue in Mid-April at LGA. Very long and stressful flight experience.,2delta-air-lines,21/04/14,Flew LHR-JFK and connecting internal flights to MCO. Excellent service at the airport and onboard. Very helpful and friendly cabin crew on all legs of the journey. Planes were clean and comfortable despite being a little old. Flight crews were very informative about potential turbulence flight times etc. There was a good selection of up to date movies and TV series available on personal entertainment screens for the long haul parts. Cabin crew would frequently offer drinks served dinner and a breakfast plus newspapers and other amenities on this section. Punctual and a pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again.,9delta-air-lines,16/04/14,Madison WI to Gainesville FL via Atlanta. Flight delayed by a few hours leaving Madison. There was a decent snowstorm going on at the time and I presumed that was the cause of the delay. Arrived late in Atlanta and just missed the connecting flight to Gainesville. Delta staff at Atlanta said the delay was actually due to mechanical reasons and promptly provided meal and hotel vouchers for an excellent hotel and rebooking on the first flight the following morning. Obviously the delayed flight is a negative but in this particular case Delta efficiently made adequate accommodations for stranded passengers in a situation where it would have been easy for them to blame the weather and refuse to make accommodations at all. For that they deserve some commendation.,7delta-air-lines,15/04/14,Horrible service horrible planes Delta does not care about their passengers. No matter what happens they only have on excuse - technical problems with the plane. I booked my flights with Delta because the price is usually $30-50 cheaper but I've learned my lesson - it's not worth it. (I fly about 10 times a year and have done so for last 6 years) I don't remember their flight being ever on time. They've failed 100 out of 100 times. I wish everyone would stop flying with them just to show them that in order to stay in business they have to take care of their customers.,delta-air-lines,14/04/14,I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service.,delta-air-lines,14/04/14,Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care. I won't be flying Delta again not if I can help it at least. U.S air was on time and staff was very friendly.,delta-air-lines,13/04/14,"AF3628 (operated by Delta) Paris-NY JFK 6th April. Extremely disappointed with Delta the only normal element was that the flight was on time. The staff service was not pleasant and not helpful. The lavatory (even before taking off) was dirty. No newspapers (we'll give you whatever will be left after business class passengers have been served). The food was appalling and a horrible non-descript sandwich (which almost everyone put aside) should not be called a ""meal"". What a trip.",3delta-air-lines,13/04/14,I went DTW-SFO AND SFO-DTW. Took Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300 both ways. The seat comfort was great! There was a lot of leg room. The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't smiling that much or very polite. There was a lot of food selection and prices were decent. We got complimentary drinks twice which was great. The inflight entertainment system has a ton of selection although most of the movies and tv shows cost money. But the music selection was amazing so it was great. Overall the Delta flights were really good and I would definitely fly it again.,8delta-air-lines,08/04/14,"Extremely dissatisfied with Delta. Original flight delayed with no explanation. Missed connecting flight by 5 minutes. The next flight I was able to get on and still make my appointment at my destination - at boarding time was advised of ""mechanical issues"" and not sure of length of delay. For the price of airfare this lack of service and commitment is unacceptable.",delta-air-lines,08/04/14,I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for.,8delta-air-lines,02/04/14,DL010 ATL-LHR on 7th March. Very tight connection from Dallas through Atlanta made the flight with minutes to spare and my bags made it onto the flight too! Extremely attentive cabin staff comfortable lie flat bed good selection of food and drink IFE was a little dated but didn't mind as was tired and needed the sleep. Flight arrived early quick bag delivery. All round great experience.,10delta-air-lines,30/03/14,We had a very good flight from DUS to LAX with transfer in ATL. Service on both flights was good even if meals on the inner-USA flight were not for free.,9delta-air-lines,30/03/14,Our flight from LAX to JFK was on time and we arrived earlier than planned. Service was a little slow due to the reason they don't accept cash payment for meals and Credit Card verification wasn't that fast. Inflight entertainment was really good!,9delta-air-lines,30/03/14,Economy Comfort DTW-LAX on a 767-300 and LAX-DTW on a 737-900. To LAX the 767-300 seat was good although it did not have the adjustable headrest. Multiple drink runs and plenty of cookies peanuts and pretzels. Personal entertainment had okay choices. Back to DTW the 737-900 was great. Seats were very comfortable. Again multiple drink runs and lots of snacks. Purchased the fruit/cheese tray and tapas both of which were very good. The personal entertainment had tons of movies. Overall - very good experience. I hope that all aircraft get seats with adjustable headrests as they do make a difference on a 4+ hour flight.,8delta-air-lines,26/03/14,"I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome"" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice. After 6 hours on a rather uncomfortable seat we started our decent with yet again the sarcastic hostess picking out her two favorite passengers and offering them secret mimosas while the rest of us looked on. Not a good experience pretty frustrating and undoubtedly embarrassing.",3delta-air-lines,26/03/14,Paid $622 for so-called Sky Priority First Class from Detroit to Tampa. What a joke! My checked bag was taken off the non-stop because they were overweight. I guess Sky Priority means they ditch your bag before everyone else. Planes are filthy. First class lavatory filthy. First class crowded with coach passengers using forward lavatory. No attempt by FAs to deter this. First overheads filled with coach luggage. Several first class flights last year on AA were terrific also first on Icelandair - also terrific. Save your money - Delta is now a low cost low service airline do not bother to pay for First class.,1delta-air-lines,26/03/14,3/24/14 I was set to departing from Atlanta to Greensboro NC on flight DL4933 and returning from Greensboro NC to Atlanta on DL1461. Upon boarding I noticed that there was a climate issue on the flight where half of the plane was extremely cold and the back half of the flight was unbearably hot. I was not the only passenger to complain to no avail to the flight staff. After about 30min on the runway with no movement we were notified that there was an engine malfunction and all passengers would need to depart the aircraft. We were told at 8.50am that the maintenance would take an hour at the most. It is now 10.33am and there has been no resolution to the situation. The ladies at the customer care center across from D27 have been the only people to attempt to assist me. I attempted to inform the representatives at the departure gate (D13) that I was attempting to go to a funeral and any options would be appreciated and they stated that they understood and asked me to take a seat and wait. As a result of my flight not being ready to depart Atlanta at 10.40am and the viewing in Winston-Salem NC beginning at 11.00am I was unable to pay my respects.,delta-air-lines,24/03/14,Flew Washington to London via Atlanta. Flight from Washington to Atlanta was fine drinks service and pretzels provided however bad weather meant the service was suspended. Annoying the flight was full and warnings were given about hand luggage due to the flight being full however quite a lot of other passengers had loads of luggage including massive cases that would normally be checked in. Flight from Atlanta to London was fine meal service delayed due to bad weather but meal was tasty and full drinks service offered. On demand TV with good selection would definitely fly Delta again.,8delta-air-lines,24/03/14,BOS-ATL-LIM-ATL-BOS in Business Class. Flight experience was excellent. Great crews very comfortable lay-flat bed seating wonderful IFE superb meals. Additionally very good wines offered. I have never had aged wines on a flight before. The return from LIM to ATL was canceled due to a mechanical issue and DL had to fly the part down on their flight from ATL the next day. DL did a commendable job accommodating the over 200 passengers. Excellent pro-active customer service. The only part of this trip that was any type of letdown was the Club in ATL in Terminal E. The Club was packed the seating awkward and uncomfortable the food offerings pretty bad and the Wifi so slow it was unusable. The BOS Club was great however. All in all a very good experience yet again with DL.,9delta-air-lines,22/03/14,Flew Jan 22 from Burlington VT to Tampa FL. They changed planes giving us a smaller one so they ran out of seats they offered compensation took the flight up to Atlanta GA. No heating on plane we were freezing attendants kept there coats on for the trip. No hot drinks peanuts pretzels or soft drinks. Next flight to Tampa was ok on way back the plane land in LaGuardia NY put us onboard waited an 1 hour before leaving while the plane was being de-iced they had only one truck there to de-ice 3 planes. They compensate us with peanuts and pretzels - very disappointed with Delta.,2delta-air-lines,17/03/14,Flew GSO to CZM through ATL. We received complimentary upgrades to business class. The meal was the best meal I have had on a plane and the sandwich and puree would have rivalled sandwich shops. Everything was excellent. The seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were helpful and courteous. Highly recommend.,10delta-air-lines,17/03/14,Our flight to Tulsa has been delayed for almost 5 hours. During this time we have not been given satisfactory updates. We've only been told mechanical difficulties. 5 hours later they are still trying to decide if they will bring another plane. I will not fly Delta in the future.,delta-air-lines,17/03/14,DL1467 13 Mar ATL-SAN. Flight operated with 767 equipment. As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously. This was true Delta service from the heart and was to me a benchmark of what DL can be. Even though I am a Million Miler I was impressed by one of the best flights I have had.,10delta-air-lines,17/03/14,Flew DL007 from DXB to ATL. I have traveled this flight 12 or more times. Most of the time my experience is always positive. This specific trip the IFE was not working very well for the first 3+ hours of the flight. They had to reset the system about 4 or 5 times. I was seated in 44J (Exit row window seat). I always sit in Row 44 which is the row with nothing in front of you. I am a frequent flyer so I have this option. The food was decent. The mid flight snack is normally just a turkey sandwich and a mini banana. You can normally get one drink with your meal just ask for it. The flight attendants are very kind every time on this flight. Sometimes you get a joker too. The bathrooms always become quite disgusting but that's understandable on a 15 hour flight. I enjoyed my flight but will be flying Business class with my miles next flight.,8delta-air-lines,17/03/14,Flew CZM to ATL. We were supposed to leave on 28th January but didn't end up leaving until 30th January. This obviously wasn't the airlines fault so you cannot give them a worse score for the weather. We were complimentary upgraded to business class on this flight but since the plane had landed the night prior they didn't have the hot meal we received on the way down. They did however give us all the cookies and chips and any other snacks they had. Along with liquor. The seats were very comfortable and the flight attendants were very courteous. Overall a great flight.,8delta-air-lines,14/03/14,Rochester to Ft Lauderdale through Atlanta 3/6/14 - 3/9/14. I was very happy with two aspects and unhappy with one. We taxied from the gate in Atlanta found there were tornadoes in Florida and turned back to the gate. The speed with which we were told what happened and with which Delta decided to bring us back to the gate were beyond anything I've recently experienced from the airlines. I was very impressed with the kindness and quick solution when I got home after the trip realized I left a book on the plane called the airport held it for me and I got it back two days later. My one complaint was with the one hour line to get through TSA at 5 am March 9 in Ft Lauderdale-I think Delta blames this on TSA. Overall very satisfied with Delta.,8delta-air-lines,12/03/14,PHL-CDG-PHL on a Boeing 757ER. Went on a family vacation to Paris back in July 2013. Leaving Philly the flight left on time at 9pm and got to Paris 30 minutes early around 10.15am. Flight wasn't full so I went to an empty row to lay down for the almost 8hr flight. Each seat had TV's in the headrest and the plane had wifi but flying over the Atlantic ocean the wifi didn't. The food served wasn't the best and the complimentary breakfast was a joke they gave us OJ a banana and a blueberry muffin. Leaving Paris we had an hour delay because of a storm and when we finally boarded the plane we had another half hour delay because a family of 10 had a virus and were all forced to get off. My original seat flying from Paris was changed without any notification prior to the vacation. Luckily my mother checked the flights each day to make sure nothing bad happened to our flights. The flight was full minus the family who got kicked off the plane. For the almost 8hr flight you would think they would use a 2 aisle plane instead of one. My TV didn't work. For long haul flights I doubt I'll take Delta again.,5delta-air-lines,12/03/14,Feb 25th flight DL4884 DL4938 / March 4TH DL5355 DL892 DL4682. I had not ever flown with Delta before last week. I have been very impressed with the customer service as well as the price. Atlanta airport was daunting first time round but the second visit was much easier to work through.,10delta-air-lines,03/03/14,Flight 2395 PBI-LGA on a MD-88 aircraft on July 30th. Only positive was an on time flight. Thankful this flight wasn't any longer then it was. Experience was awful and I felt very unwelcome as if I was an inconvenience. Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on. Restrooms in rear were out of order leaving everyone on the plane to have to all use the one restroom in first class. Took about 30 minutes to receive my luggage at baggage claim. Overall not a pleasant experience.,3delta-air-lines,03/03/14,"I have flown Delta for years because I live in metro Detroit. I am a frequent flyer and am in many ways ""stuck"" but after this experience I am going to find an alternative. I am sure my business does not matter however I think if one person tells one other and so on perhaps customers can have a voice! It is a shame that people cannot be treated better!",delta-air-lines,03/03/14,CDG-MIN-DFW - great service - nice staff - managed to get me and my luggage in an 1 hour connection (got on the plane 15 min before take off).,10delta-air-lines,27/02/14,I was travelling with my teenage son and 3 others on a flight to Boston. We received excellent service from everyone. The attendants encouraged our tall teenage boys to move to seats with more legroom as the flight was not full and supplied them with all the refreshments they asked for with a smile. They gave us great advise for when we landed. Extra cups of tea were not a problem and also came with delicious cookies! Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms. They again encouraged us to move for more room and once again all refreshments were served with a smile.,10delta-air-lines,25/02/14,Long and short of it is that it took a succession of 5 aircrafts last week to get from Detroit to Burlington VT. The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5. I usually fly Delta and have generally found their service to be very good. However they need to address the Customer Service issues in Detroit.,delta-air-lines,22/02/14,"Flew from Seattle to Vegas on a ""cosy"" CRJ900. Service was friendly seat comfortable and snacks and drinks on offer were good for a 1hr 45min. Flight and bags were first on the carousel easily worth the extra $70 IMO.",8delta-air-lines,22/02/14,DL002 London Heathrow to JFK 15th Feb returned on 21st Feb flight KL6005 JFK to London Heathrow. This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this. Flying home from JFK seats were not allocated until the gate meaning on a night flight my daughter was on the opposite side of the plane to myself.,7delta-air-lines,21/02/14,Feb 7 2014. Frankfurt (Germany) to NYC (USA). All in all I had one of the best long distance flights in a while. The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta.,9delta-air-lines,21/02/14,After visiting Tucson AZ I was embarking on my return journey from Tucson to Edinburgh via Atlanta and Paris on Monday 17th Feb. The incoming flight from Atlanta arrived more or less on time but as soon as it landed it was clear there was a problem with the aircraft. It turns out that none of the lavatories were functional. This caused a severe delay making me reschedule my entire journey one day later. I was offered a hotel - which was fine - and given what was described to me as meal vouchers. These were not fine. They were in fact practically useless pieces of paper. No one took the time to explain that they were only valued at $6. A fact I was also unaware of until I came to pay and pay I did. As far as I am concerned if I am given a meal voucher I expect a meal. In fact this worthless piece of paper does not buy anything on the menu - even a bowl of soup. To add insult to injury there was no breakfast voucher at all. American airlines already have a bad reputation so perhaps I should not have expected better.,1delta-air-lines,21/02/14,"Was scheduled from Milwaukee to Detroit to Norfolk VA on Thursday 2/13. Our plane in MKE was delayed over an hour because of weather. Because of that we missed our connection to Norfolk. The captain said we'd be rebooked on the next flight - we weren't. My three traveling companions and I couldn't be rebooked until Saturday 2/15 after our event was over. Delta's customer ""service"" area in the Detroit airport consist of a bank of phones with no human beings present. We were continually bounced between phone representatives and gate agents with neither being helpful. We ended up renting a car and driving (yes over 12 hrs) Avoid Delta at all costs.",delta-air-lines,18/02/14,DL 1169 MIA to LAX Feb 13 2014. It is impossible to get an upgrade as a Platinum Medallion between Florida and California on Delta. In addition the system wide upgrades are never available. Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch. My trip yesterday was like a 5 hour closed MRI. It is sad to see great airline go down the tubes in rewarding loyalty.,2delta-air-lines,17/02/14,"February 1 2014. CDG (Paris) to SEA (Seattle-Tacoma). I would have given Delta a higher score an 8 out of 10 for trip satisfaction but the seats on the aircraft were very uncomfortable (the worst I've experienced). The recline was minimal which made it impossible for me to sleep. I had to remove the catalogue / inflight magazine from the seat pocket in front of me in order to gain a 1/2 inch or so of leg space. I considered upgrading to economy comfort but only available seats were by the toilets and the seats were described as having ""up to"" 4 inches of additional leg room but no mention of additional recline. The seats are acceptable short flights but not for long-haul travel.",3delta-air-lines,17/02/14,"I recently flew to Fort Wayne from Philly. Both ways had a lay over so I flew 4 separate planes. Of the 4 I had a broken seat on 3 of them. Not able to recline on 2 because it was broken and the other I had a broken seat cushion that repeatedly slid off making the flight that much more comfortable as I had to keep standing and fixing it. At least I was able to enjoy a beverage. Oh no I was not because 2 flights did not serve any and the last leg of my journey the 3 flight ""attendants"" were unable to fully serve the plan in the 70 min we were in the air. I have taken 20 min flights in Europe where I get served fresh tea and a biscuit by one flight steward for the entire plane. If ever have the displeasure of flying your airline I will be sure to bring duck tape a tool box and a coke so I can be comfortable.",delta-air-lines,10/02/14,ATL-DUB Delta 176 in business class leaving Atlanta on November 22 and returning November 30 Delta 177. The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight. The only real downside is that it cost me nearly double the frequent flier miles to fly for free than it had cost me when I flew Delta to Dublin in 2000. All in all a very positive experience.,10delta-air-lines,10/02/14,"Wife and I flying from Memphis Tenn. to Edmonton Alberta. Released from the Memphis hospital (after a stroke) on Sunday flying home the next day. When we booked the flight we requested we sit together due to my need for assistance. Reply ""No problem"" get to the airport check in we are in the same row. but her on one side of the plane I am on the other 2 people and 1 aisle between us. We explained the situation to the clerk they said ""No problem we will fix it at the gate."" Result - back seats in the plane no recline at all very limited space.",delta-air-lines,10/02/14,I flew from DUB-JFK-PHX. The transatlantic leg was enjoyable. The flight attendants did several drink runs although they only pour half a can unlike other airlines. Each passenger had their own personal backseat TV and the movie/music/game selection was fantastic. Headphones are provided for those didn't bring their own. Toilets were clean and hot towels are provided to freshen up. The second leg from JFK-PHX was less impressive. Entertainment is provided by an old CRT monitor in the centre of the aisle meaning you have no choice in what you watch. Expect old sitcom reruns. No meals on this flight either despite it being nearly as long as DUB-JFK. The boredom of this flights combined with my hunger meant I couldn't wait to get off. Conclusion: fly Delta transatlantic but avoid for domestic flights within the USA.,7delta-air-lines,10/02/14,Flew JNB-ATL-SNA on Feb 6 2014. Departure from JNB on time though boarding was a bit chaotic. Economy class seating on B77L from JNB-ATL ok. Weber slimline seats are a quite firm and this becomes ever more evident on this long 16 hour flight. Cabin crew most unfriendly and really did not want to be providing the on board services. In flight meals very poor. Cabin crew on ATL-SNA flight a little better. AVOD on B77L very good with excellent picture quality and selections.,4delta-air-lines,03/02/14,I have flown Delta 3 round trips in the past 3 months. The first flight had an engine problem over the Atlantic and we had to make an emergency landing in Canada and were forced to sit on the plane for 6 hours waiting for a new plane. I do have to say the crew was great. Missing my connection I arrived home a day late. My second flight was normal with no issues. My trip had another engine problem. This time before take-off. Instead of getting home on Friday night I had to wait until Saturday night to get home. The crews and ground staff have been great but Delta is not maintaining its planes.,2delta-air-lines,03/02/14,Honolulu to LA First class. Lucked out got a flight that was inbound from Japan so configuration was Intl business. Normally Hawaii routes get the oldest planes with the least amount of comfort. This was a wonderful surprise. Complemented by a wonderful crew that was eager to please with warm excellent service this flight was a pleasure. Great entertainment nice lunch warm service and tail winds.,10delta-air-lines,03/02/14,BKK-NRT-BKK in Business Elite on B747. Don't fly Delta much and was impressed with the product. Seats comfortable and private whilst seated on upper deck. Cabin ambience pleasant service attentive and professional IFE above average. In general a cut above the other American carriers and significantly better than the previous Delta international business product. Only disappointment was not having Premium Lane cards for arrival in BKK. BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK. I enquired about it with the crew and they were baffled and seemed to have no idea with what I was talking about as if they had never heard of it. Other than that very nice experience.,8delta-air-lines,31/01/14,January 15th SLC to CDG. I would have purchased an economy comfort seat for the extra $210 but the only available ones were by the toilets. My economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have experienced on a long flight - inadequate seat padding and very limited recline. Otherwise the flight was acceptable the food edible the FAs competent performance on time. Next time I fly to Europe I'll avoid Delta on account of my experience with the uncomfortable seat. Based on my experience on this trip I would not recommend Delta to friends and family. I may fly Delta again but only on short domestic trips.,2delta-air-lines,29/01/14,"GSO-BKK and return via ATL and NRT. All flights on time and no issues with check in and boarding. All the long distance flights were on 747-400. Although you can no longer call these the ""Queen of the Sky"" they still give a comfortable reassuring ride. Delta can be complimented on upgrading their business class product. The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights. To compete with the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers though Delta needs to brush up on a few areas. In particular the menu selections and service need to be better but my biggest gripe is with the bathrooms which fully reflect the 25 year age of the plane and at the end of a 13 hour flight. I shall say no more.",7delta-air-lines,25/01/14,SIN-NRT return. DL 622 and DL 621. Both flights were on 777-200ER equipped with on demand ptv. SIN-NRT: Could not find the USB port to charge my phones on the flight to NRT. Hot breakfast was served at local time 8 am 2hrs into the flight. Hot snack of chicken wrap was served 2 hrs before landing. The odd part was the entertainment programmes were switched off 4 hrs into the flight with no explanation. Most passengers were asleep due to the early departure of the flight at 5.45 am. NRT-SIN: USB port was installed beside the PTV. Hot dinner was served 2 hrs into the flight. Snack of ice cream were served 2 hrs before landing. Crew of Chinese national and Singaporean crew were helpful. Asked if passengers wanted extra ice cream. Self help galley provided Evian water only. DL offers the cheapest fare for direct flights to Japan and will travel with them again.,8delta-air-lines,20/01/14,While the flight attendants on all the Delta flights were nice I've noticed the planes they use aren't the best of quality/maybe not well maintained and their customer service seems non-existent. On a flight I took recently from Moscow to NYC during both take off and landing the roof of the plane was leaking a lot of water (over passengers). If you were sitting in a window seat (like me) it seemed to leak quite a lot enough to get you wet. The leaking eventually stopped when the plane was higher up in the air. The flight attendants couldn't really do anything about it since it was an issue with the plane itself. I left bad feedback on the flight and filed a complaint and Delta never seems to respond. So next time I fly I will probably read more reviews on air carriers and try to pick one that's known for better service.,delta-air-lines,20/01/14,ATL-LAS December 2013. Main and pretty much only issue was legroom. In certain configurations of their 757-200 seats 2C/D are bulkhead seats where we were seated and legroom is severely restricted. Other than that it was a pretty average/decent experience. A snack basket containing the typical peanuts pretzels and chocolates was passed around twice. Flight attendants were courteous. The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath. PTVs were also available with an excellent selection of holiday and other films. Since the flight departed around 9:30pm no complimentary dinner was served. All in all it was an OK flight just beware of the first class bulkhead seats on certain 757 configurations.,7delta-air-lines,16/01/14,Flew on December 19 DEN-ATL-SRQ and return all flights were on time even with all the delays in the NE. One flight had PTV's on a 757 which was very nice other 3 flights on a md's nicely updated with power outlets in economy comfort which was very nice. Greeted nicely at each gate by name. All staff very professional and better than Delta or American without a doubt!,10delta-air-lines,15/01/14,Flew LHR-CUN (via ATL outbound and MSP return) in Business Elite. Pre-flight customer service (via Twitter) was excellent with the one or two queries we had. Check-in fast track security and lounge at LHR T4 very good - much better than BA at T5. Seats (flat beds) very good although foot area a little compact - we're 5'6 and 5'8 so taller travellers may be less happy. Pillow and duvet very comfortable. Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage. On board service excellent and friendly - on the outbound flight two crew (including the purser) came round with chocolates and thanked us for flying Delta they really sounded like they meant it. Will definitely fly Delta transatlantic again.,8delta-air-lines,15/01/14,DL1954 on 12/30 and DL1910 on 1/1/14. Checking in with first class with Delta was nice because we got advanced security clearance. The rest was disappointing. I guess I am used to first class with American. Snacks offered were like sombody's left over Halloween treats. There was no music or entertainment offered.,5delta-air-lines,14/01/14,Flew from JFK to Las Vegas January 9-12. Check-in was very good even at 6am. I liked the bistro in the waiting area. The plane was clean and orderly. The only real disappointment was the food and drink selection offered with the flight a tablespoon of peanuts or a shy dozen of mini-pretzels. The real disappointment (inflight) was with the entertainment as in none. The screen was jumping (and audio) as if the VCR was old and the screens had rainbow colors to them as if the TV's were well past their prime. Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it. For $600+ a seat it should be a lot better especially since last year was a banner year for profits for the airlines. How sad. This is America's best? Hey Delta pay it forward and invest in your equipment.,7delta-air-lines,14/01/14,Used Delta from JFK to Fort Lauderdale and have to say that the experience was far from first class. Before takeoff a lady got on in a dishevelled state and distributed bottled water after she had stowed her luggage in an overhead locker. It turned out she was an off duty stewardess helping out the on duty staff. During the flight drinks were served and a banana was thrown to the first class passengers by way of food. The only good thing to be said was that the flight was on time.,delta-air-lines,13/01/14,My husband and 1 year old daughter was flying today (01/11/2014) from Charlotte to Albany through Detroit. Their flight got delayed 1 hr due to some mechanical repairs. Then they missed their connecting flight to Albany due to that delay. They ended up waiting from 12 Noon to 8pm for their next flight to Albany. By 8pm their flight got cancelled and got a new schedule for tomorrow. With connecting flight from Detroit-Atlanta-Albany. I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. This type of incident happens for us for the third time. Very bad service of flights.,delta-air-lines,09/01/14,SIN-NRT-SIN. Economy. Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future.,9delta-air-lines,09/01/14,Flying round trip from Columbus OH to Las Vegas through Detroit. Jan 3-6 2014. Delta gate agents are rude and abrupt. They were late getting me to my connection in DTW due to computer problems during boarding at the gate in Columbus. I made it to the gate in DTW 12 min before departure but the agent had given away my seat and said sternly that it was to late and to go complain at gate A43. I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being.,delta-air-lines,08/01/14,Flew from LAX to Haneda (12/22/2013) and from Narita to LAX (12/29/2013). Flights were on time in fact earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were very courteous not typical of attendants of United States airlines. The online check in and baggage drop center that takes baggage more than 3 hours before flight time make travel a breeze.,10delta-air-lines,08/01/14,I flew during the chaos caused by the weather the delays wer understandable. Leaving mass the staff at Logan assisted me with my sick child by being attentive and making us as comfortable as they could. When we stopped in JFK again the staff were very pleasant while we waited 3 hours to board to Dominican Rep. Staff did what they could to keep passengers entertained. On the other hand I feel like customer service stops in the US while in the Dominican Rep I felt like I was dealing with a whole different airline. staff were rude and inconsiderate. Delta needs to take time to train their Dominican staff.,5delta-air-lines,07/01/14,"I was on this flight which was delayed by over 2 hours in Atlanta and never once were we given the reason for the delay. That's fine. A delay is a delay. Here is where it gets interesting. Once we boarded this old DC plane the cabin crew promptly made an announcement that they had ""forgotten"" to load water to the tanks. So even though the flush would work there would be no water from the faucets to wash our hands. Instead there was just a bottle of water kept in the toilet. Yes that was my Delta experience! I met another traveler in Mexico a few days later who apparently flew the same flight two days later and had the same water issue. This really explains why I should avoid Delta in the future! Absolutely no customer service.",3delta-air-lines,06/01/14,Economy Comfort Manila to Tokyo Narita. The extra $39 is well worth it. Much more peaceful cabin and priority boarding. The extra recline and seat pitch really made a difference. Flight attendants anticipated the needs of passengers. consistently offering snacks and refreshments. they were very courteous and tried to address the concerns of passengers as best they can. I also appreciated the fact that they took the extra effort of addressing me by my name. It was very thoughtful of them.,10delta-air-lines,04/01/14,DL0117 on 12/29/13 STR to ATL on 767-300ER. 1x2x1 config in Delta's premium cabin remains unbeatable service levels w/Delta generally consistent. This flight even surprised on the upside: excellent menu out of STR and a top notch cabin crew. Is it a throw back to times past when an attendant cares to monitor your Scotch remains 'easy ice' i.e. bring an additional ice cube when needed and without being prodded? That was a crew that made it a joy to fly over the Holidays. Delta wins on many levels these days.,10delta-air-lines,03/01/14,New Orleans to Boston. A blizzard was headed for the Boston area and delays were expected. Was charged $100 because my luggage was 2.3 lbs over weight. I asked a man working at the ticket area to help me transfer to an earlier flight in order to beat the storm. He told me he would put me on standby and directed me toward a gate. Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby. Lady then put me in standby and told me she would call my name if a seat opened up. Everyone began to board the flight and my name had not been called just as they were closing the gate the lady yelled at me to get on the plane. Ran down the ramp. Flight staff were OK landed a little early. Things went much smoother in Atlanta.,4delta-air-lines,02/01/14,"Florida to Seattle flights delayed due to weather and would miss connection in Atlanta. Understandable. Ticket agent wanted to send me to Atlanta and sit on standby. Whereby I was not guaranteed a seat and no hotel meal compensation. Had agent book me on flight early next day instead. Booked seat from Florida to Atlanta but no seat booked from Atlanta to Seattle by agent and now on standby. Tried to assign seat over internet but was blocked because agent put me on standby. Called Delta and was informed that the airport agents now had control and could not book a seat. Told telephone agent to let me speak to supervisor as I was looking at 25 empty seats on their website. Agent spoke to supervisor and supervisor assigned me a seat. Now why couldn't other agent have done that hours earlier? Arrived at baggage check-on area (already had boarding passes) for ""red-eye"" return trip from Seattle. Stood in line watching understaffed agents for 20 minutes and was told when we finally got to the front of the line that we had missed the baggage check-in window by 3 minutes. Keep in mind we had already stood in line 20 minutes. Told to go to the Special Services line. Got in Special Services line and stood for 15 minutes. By now not only had my wife and I missed checking our bags but we had now missed the flight. Told by ""red coated"" Supervisor is that all they could do was put us on standby for a 11.25 pm ""red-eye"" flight with no guarantee we could even get on the plane as there were no seats available. As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later. When we asked where we could find a hotel she pointed the directions to the hotel board center and basically said we were on our own. The last straw was they lost our baggage on the return flight. Finally came in on the next flight after midnight next day.",1delta-air-lines,30/12/13,2 hours flight between Atlanta and Nassau. Business class ticket. Very old and noisy aircraft (MD88). Business class seats OK. Sky Priority boarding. Except bananas and bretzel and drinks do not expect any meal served at dinner time even for a 1500 USD ticket. No lounge access for this international destination except if you have the right frequent flyer status. I will avoid to fly them again for this amount of money.,3delta-air-lines,29/12/13,We made reservations way in advance prepaid our flights and chose the seats that best accommodated our needs. Delta then changed the flights on several occasions and reassigned our seats giving us the worst possible seating even having our kids separate from us. We called customer service and were told they could not do anything that they are not allowed to change other people's seats. That is exactly what they did to us! We learned our lesson the hard way and we hope to never have to fly Delta again.,delta-air-lines,29/12/13,I recently took a trip from Huntsville AL to OKC from Nov 21-Dec 27th. I found my first flight to be a very pleasant experience but what impressed me was how my return flight was handled. We were late I was due to depart at 3.30 and by the time I checked in it was 3.21. I was booked on the 6.10 flight right then and there. The staff didn't even charge a fee for having to change my flight.,10delta-air-lines,25/12/13,To Las Vegas from Jacksonville Florida. The plane we were on from Atlanta to Las Vegas a long flight had no leg room and there were two large men and me in a row! On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there! And went right back to their discussion.,3delta-air-lines,23/12/13,BOS-AMS-BOS Dec 2013. I don't know when they put the upgraded Airbus 330s into service but it's as good as any business service I've seen on a US carrier. 1-2-1 seating so if you're by the window you're not trapped if the person next to you is in full recline mode. In the usual 2-2-2 format I've always avoided the window but on this service the window seat at 9J worked very well. The seats are on the narrow side for business but you get an individual pod that's narrower in the front (where your feet go) wider in the back; the seats have full recline. Cabin staff on both flights were senior attentive and friendly. On AMS-BOS the genial captain came back before take-off to chat up everyone in business individually. I only used the A/V to track flight progress but the screen is large and pops out of the pod wall. The pillow was comfortable. The amenities kit is about average - the usual socks etc. but nothing special and they don't offer the business amenity that my wife really likes - PJ''s.,8delta-air-lines,23/12/13,"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience.",5delta-air-lines,23/12/13,"Newark to LA via Minneapolis. I arrived at Newark airport with plenty of time before my flight was due to leave. I was then told via the computer alert system that my flight was one hour delayed. After a one hour delay I was allowed to board the flight. We then proceed to sit on the runway for another hour and as a consequence I missed my connection. Once I landed in Minneapolis I was told (very abruptly and rudely) that I had missed the flight and was told to then search for my new boarding pass in amongst a sea of boarding passes of others who had also missed their flights because handing them out individually would have been too easy and maybe make sense? I then proceeded through the airport to the baggage reclaim and customer information area where I asked the Delta airlines representative whether there was any available food for people who had missed their flights. She told me that if I wanted something to eat I had to order a pizza. Last but not certainly not least when I was finally able to pick up my rucksack from the Delta ""office"" I was wearing a sling due to a shoulder injury. Delta staff in the office watched me struggle to pick up my backpack for around ten minutes before finally I actually had to ask them for help. I must say though through all my complaining I had two okay stewardesses on that flight however the rest of the Delta staff were rude and inconsiderate.",delta-air-lines,20/12/13,"DAL 417 LAX to SYD and DAL 16 from SYD to LAX. Both legs on Delta's 777-200LR in seat 7A. Used kiosk for check-in at both LAX and SYD. The Delta ""business class"" lounge at LAX is nothing more than Delta's normal ""Sky Club"" the facility was overcrowded and like being inside an extremely loud bar. The flights pushed back pretty much on time. Delta's 777-200LR is getting a bit worn looking and the herringbone ""suites"" that face away from the windows (as opposed to the much-better window-facing suites used by carriers like Cathay Pacific) had walls so low that privacy was minimal. I was lucky enough to have seat 7A on both flights; 7A has the advantage of having a closet next to the seat which in effect forms a cave that the seat reclines back into. The set-up is very good for allowing sleep. The flight crews were LA-based both directions seemed to be made up of senior FA's and on balance did a really nice service both directions. The flights featured three meal services - dinner/lunch a mid-flight snack and a light breakfast. The forward and mid galleys had a variety of low end snacks available throughout the flight. The AVOD system is OK (screen sizer and location) but nothing special but it does have available a fairly broad selection of movies. The best part of the flights was my ability to sleep. I am a large guy and I've had real trouble trying to sleep in the flat-bed first and business seats used by British Air Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Delta was a refreshing change. I got 7-8 solid hours of quality sleep time on both flights. Part of the reason is that the FA's move the meal service process along efficiently and get the cabin lights down early into the flight. On arrival although Delta offers BusinessElite passengers a fast-track immigration/customs pass I didn't use them because as a TSA Global Entry cardholder I was able to use the kiosks in both Sydney and LAX. As I only had carryons the total time from plane until I was out of the airport could not have been more than 10 minutes. In the past I've normally flown on Qantas to/from Australia and New Zealand but with Delta's codeshare arrangement with Virgin Australia (an excellent carrier by the way in all respects) and given my outstanding recent experience on Delta's 777 I plan to continue using Delta for my travel to/from Oceania.",8delta-air-lines,20/12/13,"MNL-NRT-JFK (B744/Premium Economy) EWR-ATL(A319/Y) ATL-SNA (B757/Y) SNA-MSP (A319/Y) MSP-EWR (A320/Y) and JFK- NRT-MNL (B744/Y). In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth. Not only did I get a whole lot of extra space and privacy but extra TV monitors pillow and blankets as well. Much much better than premium economy but at no extra cost. It was an overall pleasant experience flying DL this time.",8delta-air-lines,17/12/13,Flew DL7 Dubai to Atlanta. Excellent service from staff. Yes I am short so I fit into the sleeper seat and yes if I were taller it would not be a good fit. Screen on entertainment is adequate. Staff was warm attentive and friendly.,8delta-air-lines,17/12/13,We left unreasonably early (6 hours ahead) to drop off our rental car and to accommodate the weather. While on route to the airport Delta left a voicemail that our flight was delayed so we would miss our next flight home. He looked up another potential flight and asked if we were able to make it to a flight that should have been boarding as we spoke. So it seemed unlikely that we would make it but it was delayed. So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours. They could not accommodate us for an inconvenience that was not our fault without an extra charge of one hundred dollars. I'm not satisfied with my service from Delta Airlines to say the least.,delta-air-lines,16/12/13,I had to make a last minute trip (same day round-trip) to SFO from LAX on 12/12/2013. I have not flown in economy in years except for Southwest but chose Delta as their price was much lower than Southwest (first class not worth it for this short of flight in my opinion): I booked this trip 10 days in advance. While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport. I still love Southwest but on this route I have now found a better airline.,10delta-air-lines,16/12/13,"Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL) to San Francisco (SFO). I was originally supposed to fly from ATL into SJC (San Jose) but was later rebooked Dec 6th and Dec 7th. I missed my connection because the plane was first over- fuelled then under-fuelled and then there were issues with the ""paperwork."" In Atlanta I was forced to call Delta call center (huge lines to speak with customers representatives on site) to rebook my flight was asked to hold for 30 minutes. When I called again they told me I was holding for no reason because the representative had hung up on my call. My bag is also missing.",1delta-air-lines,16/12/13,Outward Manchester UK to Miami via Atlanta 5/12/13 and return from Fort Lauderdale 12/12/13. Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals. Apart from the attitude towards a cancelled flight no issues at all with Delta and would certainly fly with them again.,7delta-air-lines,12/12/13,ATL-JFK Thanksgiving week. Despite Diamond status I was with 2 family members so no upgrade O/B but still managed Economy comfort. Pretty good for 2 hour flight although no IFE. As it was thanksgiving I expected the worst but flight took off on time and landed early. On the return all 3 managed to get upgraded to first. Again pretty good for Thanksgiving Sunday. Landed on time bags already on belt by the time we hauled ourselves from E terminal to bag claim. Overall not bad apart from the price ($500 r/t each) but again it was thanksgiving!,8delta-air-lines,10/12/13,MSP-JFK-MXP and return 4 days later. Economy comfort. First time doing this route as I prefer going into and out of Linate - Milan but short notice trip forced itinerary. Very surprised and pleased with the 767 leg (JFK- Milan) wider seats and quieter cabin than the A330's used on MSP-AMS. CRJ 9XX on the way out a bit small for a 2.5 hr flight A319 on return bigger but noisy. JFK transfer a bit of a hassle with on-going construction but new terminal is nice improvement. MXP was a pain to exit on return. Overall Delta experience is improving and remains a decent choice from MSP to Europe. I still prefer Linate over Malpensa at least for now.,8delta-air-lines,09/12/13,ONT-SLC-CDG-AMS-MME on 2-3 December (some of the flights were on AF and KL metal but it was a Delta ticket with DL flight numbers for all the segments). An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.,8delta-air-lines,06/12/13,I started flying Delta about a year ago and surprisingly there wasn't much to complain about. After reading a few reviews I was a bit sceptical but I flew them from SIN-NRT-JFK and I enjoyed the flight more than SQ. The flight attendants were warmer and friendly while we departed on time and on schedule without delays. The legroom was better than SQ and was worth the extra cost. The food although small in portions was not as bad as I expected. Overall I would recommend flying Delta.,9delta-air-lines,04/12/13,ATL-LGA-ATL first class. Very motivated crew on both flights who seemed genuinely concerned about the well-being of the passengers. Catering was adequate for a 2-hour flight although the meal uploaded in Atlanta was of better quality than the one served on the return. Return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours due to mechanical issues but the crew handled it well and tried to assist passengers with connections. Seats somewhat cramped and no IFE on the A320 and A319 I flew on but I was favorably impressed with the crew.,8delta-air-lines,03/12/13,DL 80/81 ATL-BRU-ATL. Spent a lot of money to fly in Business Elite. Seats comfortable (lay flat) and entertainment system has an amazing selection of options. Food however was so salty and so processed that it was pretty much inedible. Crews on both flights were quite senior and offered good levels of service being most accommodating. However they all lacked a sense of warmth and welcoming. I am a big fan of Delta Air Lines but these flights were somewhat disappointing primarily due to the poor quality of food and beverage provided in both directions.,7delta-air-lines,02/12/13,Everything was fine however My fiancÃ© and I booked together and were seated separately and they wouldn't do anything to try to get us to be close this is something that many people had complaints and passengers would switch seats to be with their loved ones. They also made us check a bag. Very unhappy about having to check that bag (which was smaller than the other bags that made it on and persons that got on after us also didn't have to check their bags). I don't recommend traveling with them. I just wish that they would have sat us next to each other it makes no sense that they didn't.,6delta-air-lines,02/12/13,"It's been about a month now since my trip from Milan Italy to Las Vegas NV. I flew from Milan to JFK (New York). We waited 4 hours for our connecting flight from New York to Las Vegas. I was assigned a boarding pass and a seat number (24C & 24D) at Terminal 4 gate B25. When I arrived to board the plane at the gate the rudest workers at Delta claimed they didn't see me on the system. When I ask how could this be the Delta representative kept saying ""I don't know"" very condescendingly. An hour before they announced that they needed 2 volunteers to stay overnight for a next flight because they overbooked. Delta forced us to stay at JFK while letting 2 other people take our seats on the flight that we booked over a month prior. We flew all the way from Milan to JFK how were they unable to see us on the system? How were we able to get the boarding passes in the first place if we weren't in the system? The people at the service desk kept giving us attitude and saying to us that they don't see our names on the system. I was so disappointed with my flight experience.",delta-air-lines,02/12/13,I booked our Delta flight in May 2013 for 5 family members going to Jamaica Saturday Nov. 23 and returning Saturday Nov.30. We had three changes to our itinerary the last one was in Oct. The flight from Atlanta to Montego Bay was awful. We set in the very back 2 rows of the plane not together but in 2 different rows. We had no windows. On the way back it was the same way. We had our 6 year old granddaughter with us that could see nothing on her first time flying. I'm a Gold SkyMiles Member.,delta-air-lines,29/11/13,SFO-ATL-LIM return in regular economy. I got a great deal from SFO to LIM. My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process. Would recommend especially if one can get a good deal.,7delta-air-lines,29/11/13,I traveled from Charlotte NC to Milwaukee WI and my connection in Detroit was a bit late and there was not time to transfer my suitcases. They did not arrive in baggage claim. But they delivered them 2 hours away in Madison WI on the same day and it was Thanksgiving Day.,10delta-air-lines,29/11/13,Flew to New York from Dublin with 2 small kids Fri 22 Nov and returned Mon 25. I must say I was very impressed. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The plane was full and they were kept busy but they really made my daughters feel special giving them extra cookies drinks passing chat etc. Even when one woman decided to go to the restroom a few seconds before takeoff - a potentially serious situation - they were firm but polite as they leaped down the aisle to make her sit down. IFE worked on all seats and while a couple of inches of extra legroom wouldn't have gone amiss it was fine for a six hour flight. A word about the meals. I've noticed many times that the catering supplied by European companies (ie going out) is far superior to what you get coming back from the USA regardless of airline. But that's the only criticism really. Well done Delta. In my experience you're at least as good as BA KLM and Virgin.,9delta-air-lines,28/11/13,We flew from Manchester UK to Tampa and as Delta gold members we were upgraded to business and first class due to coach being full. It was a great flight great crew and food 3 days later flew from Tampa to Texas Hobby via ATL in coach. The flights were again great snacks and drinks really good service. I feel if you are nice with their staff they are nice back.,10delta-air-lines,27/11/13,"I booked a first class ticket using miles about a month ago. The only reason I booked the particular flight (red eye) was because of the 1st class seat options. At that time there were a considerable number of 1st class seats open. I checked in via mobile 24 hours before-no issues. Got through security-still no issues. When I went to board the plane I was told when they scanned my boarding pass that I'd been downgraded to Economy (not even Economy Comfort) because I was on a complimentary upgrade. I explained that absolutely was not the case and that I'd specifically booked the flight as a 1st class ticket. The response I received at that point was that ""Corporate did it because of an equipment change we don't know the criteria they used and we can't change it."" I took it up to the most senior person I could at the gate and got the same generic answer. I used to be a huge proponent of Delta and have defended them countless times to friends. I will never fly with them again.",delta-air-lines,20/11/13,Good on time performance. Wished to have a second warm meal on board an intercontinental flight then just a breakfast. Very noisy cabin due insulation on the 737. Crew seemed unorganized and hasty. IFE wasn't working properly.,5delta-air-lines,20/11/13,Early November BE flight JFK-CDG. Clean aircraft competent FA adequate catering but the Delta lounge at T4 is a disgrace. The complimentary wines are not listed anywhere while the charged offerings are both printed and on electronic pads. Salty snacks only or purchase food. Have they visited their partner Virgin Atlantic's BC lounge? On time arrival and good baggage delivery. Very limited movies on this flight.,8delta-air-lines,20/11/13,On time departure despite chaotic boarding in BE due to a seat configuration change. FA were quite senior and not well groomed especially the purser whose uniform was stained. The FA's were very active with service however. Catering good especially the pre arrival hamburger. Lots of videos although every time there was an announcement (and they seem to make many) my movie reverted to the French language. (CDG-EWR). Pre departure lounge was Air France which was offering a buffet lunch along with many wines champagne and snacks.,8delta-air-lines,20/11/13,My wife and I flew back to London Heathrow on flight 19 from Detroit. This airline is a disgrace. Very poor food but it was the service from the flight attendants which was particularly bad. They seem to have absolutely no idea of offering a service. Passengers were treated with complete indifference and staff spent most of their time in the galley eating and talking loudly. Never again. Next time I go to Detroit I will fly BA or virgin to NY so that I only need to suffer the short hop from NYC to Detroit. Coincidentally I have a friend who has just taken a flight on Delta from NY to London who also experienced shocking service.,1delta-air-lines,20/11/13,I have been flying and traveling internationally for over 10 years and after flying Delta for the first time I will not be traveling for a very long time. Aside from the cramped plane I was refused food service on my 13 hour flight by the extremely rude flight attendants until I gave in and purchased food items. The flight itself was the absolute worst 6.5 hours of turbulence triggered my anxiety and when I tried to get my medicine from overhead I was shouted at by the attendants. Deltas entertainment was terrible and needs to be updated there were 2 small TVs in front of easily over 50 people. When the flight was over there was a half hour delay and I had to catch my next connecting flight. I will never fly Delta again.,delta-air-lines,15/11/13,My 7 month pregnant wife and I flew from Chicago to Mexico on Nov 7 2013 on Delta flight 8048. According to the Delta representative I spoke with on the phone Delta messed up and rescheduled everyone on this flight to Nov 8 (without telling anyone and even though the Nov 7 flight still flew). When we didn't show up for our Nov 8 flight in Chicago (since we were already in Mexico since Nov 7 and never knew about the Nov 8 flight) our return flight on Nov 10 was cancelled. We arrived to our airport in Mexico on Nov 10 to find out we had no return ticket to Chicago. The Delta representative was so sorry that she gave us a single 25 dollar gift card to split amongst the 2 of us. This is ridiculous. Why should I ever fly Delta ever again?,delta-air-lines,15/11/13,I flew from Chicago to Atlanta. The plane was full the staff very nice and friendly. My only complaint: the cabin was filthy it needed attention and the seats were small I'm a big guy 6 ft and 220 lbs. The flight was a short one if it had been longer it would have been uncomfortable.,6delta-air-lines,13/11/13,Worst airline to fly on if you are in the military traveling on orders. First who in the military travels with one bag that's right we don't we normaly have a few bags and one normaly weighs between 50 to 100 lbs. So why is it that all the other carriers let the military check one bag up to 100lbs no we are not getting over this is the bag that we transport our gear in. The gear that we use to take the fight to the enemy. Come on Delta get with the program and stop trying to make an extra buck off the military. I guess that's why the military generally uses American Airlines first and Delta only as a last resort. The flight only had a few people on board and when some of them asked if they could move to a vacant seat they were told no.,1delta-air-lines,13/11/13,Manchester - Atlanta - San Diego. Plenty of snacks and drinks served. Lunch was good and enjoyable. Good selection of films television and music staff were pleasant and efficient. Temperature of cabin was just right. A very positive experience.,10delta-air-lines,10/11/13,SEA-AMS-SEA. This last transatlantic with Delta will be my very last. I cannot believe KLM/Air France have partnered with Delta and I'm afraid I'm unlikely to continue patronising that group unless I'm sure I'm not flying on a Delta staffed plane. The service was just appalling. The seats in economy were very poor. The underseat space was cramped by some electrical equipment and also very hot as a result. The in-flight entertainment system was not functioning in my seat or any other seat in our row. The only element of the flight that was any good was the lounge in Seattle which had some space to work and attentive staff.,3delta-air-lines,10/11/13,BusinessElite SIN-NRT-HNL. Choose Delta only because it offered completely flat beds. B777-200LR flying from SIN-NRT- SIN offers ample legroom when in full recline. However the 767-300 planes NRT-HNL-NRT falls short for anyone over 6â€™. In full bed mode the â€˜seatâ€™ tucks into the narrow space of the seat in front of you. My main gripe was the cleanliness of the cabin. Dirtiest Business Class I've ever flown! Cabin Staff were ok not overly friendly. Pales to any Asian flight crew.,3delta-air-lines,10/11/13,"My Husband and I booked First Class. Our plane was finally determined as ""Delayed for Catering"" for 4 hours. We missed our connection of course. Originally we were told it was due to weather. There were no other flights to get us home according to the agent in Salt Lake City who said ""I don't have time to help you go over there to the phone bank"". With no flight no luggage and no help we paid for a hotel room had to by clothes meals and I hoped our underwear would dry I washed it in the sink for the next days flight. We had purposely reserved seats together I have a great deal of flight anxiety. Our rescheduled flights separated us and I cried most of the way home. It's not that we are any better than others but we paid a lot of money for our trip on Delta First Class. We bought the special tickets expecting special service. I'm disturbed with the airlines performance and regard for passengers. I guess we paid for only a larger seat.",3delta-air-lines,06/11/13,When my wife and I travel we usually travel with Delta or Alaska. We always travel first class and so cannot comment on how things are in coach however we have never been disappointed with Delta traveling first class. They always treat us well from check-in to in-flight. The planes are always clean and the staff is incredibly attentive. Unlike Alaska they never skimp on the amenities. They serve full size meals and are constantly checking to see if there is anything else they can do to accommodate you.,10delta-air-lines,04/11/13,I have to say that whilst everyone likes to moan about airlines my recent flight with Delta was great on their services from/to LHR-JFK. The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding. For the price it was truly excellent.,9delta-air-lines,04/11/13,Just flew from BWI to Melbourne FL. Worst flights I have ever had. Both flights were overbooked. The staff were asking for volunteers to take a later flight. The staff were confused and had no idea on what they were doing. They were rude and didn't know their jobs very well. This was both trips with connecting flights in Atlanta both ways. Never will I fly Delta again. One of the staff was standing at the desk telling customers she was nobody and couldn't help anyone. Now that is customer service from Delta Airlines.,delta-air-lines,31/10/13,My husband and I took a vacation back to the Midwest. We flew Delta from LAX to Minneapolis to Milwaukee with the reverse for the return flights. I was really dreading this - I have MS and knew I would be using a wheelchair. Everything was great! Flights were on time and the pilot and crew were so kind friendly and helpful. My husband and I are tall and we were pleasantly surprised to have ample leg room. Also Delta did a great job with the video on pre-flight safety notes. No one seems to listen to the actual stewards and stewardesses when it comes to this but the video had everyone's attention in this digital age. I definitely recommend flying Delta.,10delta-air-lines,29/10/13,SFO to SLC and SLC to LAX in First. Old Airbus 320 on first leg. Interesting no life vests on board just the 'buoyant' seat cushion. Newish 737-800 on leg to LAX. Excellent service and attention from Hawaiian based crew best of any American airline I have traveled on. Both flights on time check in very quick and luggage appeared rapidly. Would recommend.,8delta-air-lines,28/10/13,I flew from Toronto to Atlanta Atlanta to Cancun and Cancun to Atlanta. The seats were very comfy with a good recline especially between Atlanta and Cancun. Crew was very polite but the food choice was very poor. My flight between Toronto and Atlanta was the worst. It was operated by express jet on the behalf of Delta Airlines: poor food was served and the crew wasn't helpful at all. The seats were very hard. Definitely a bad flight. I recommend to fly with Delta airlines despite all but avoid to fly with it subsidiary express jet.,6delta-air-lines,28/10/13,SFO-LAX LAX-KOA KOA-LAX LAX-SEA SEA-CDG. Very nice experience (again) with Delta. I love Delta upgrade policies on internal flights everything is clear and fair you know at any time why you have been upgraded or not. All flights on time cabin crew smiling all the time and very professional. Very nice food. Twice upgraded with my ElitePlus status. Delta Economy comfort seats really worth.,9delta-air-lines,22/10/13,"On our outbound flight the crew ensured some people with ""carry on"" luggage checked their luggage prior to boarding. It appears that many of these ""carry on"" suitcases would not fit into the guide at the check in counter. Often these suitcases barely fit into the overhead. We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find. For this trip it was Delta (Alaska). But just because I may find a good price does not mean that I should be treated this way.",7delta-air-lines,22/10/13,Oct 17th Manchester NH to La Guardia NY flight 6269. Then missed flight 1875 La Guardia NY to Tampa Fl. Just recently flew Delta delayed in taking off then was in a holding pattern due to air traffic and missed connecting flight due to this. Wasn't able to get another flight for 8 hours or so. Will not fly Delta again.,delta-air-lines,20/10/13,"In my opinion Delta airline is the worst I have experienced. I am silver and this is the end of my Delta loyalty. I attempted to hop on an earlier flight several times because I had completed my work in Greensboro early. The lady eagerly said "" are you Gold or Platinum""? I said ""no I am Silver."" She stated it would be 50 dollars to go on standby but she is not going to bother because I am silver. With that I was dismissed with a ""Next"". This is not the first time this has occurred and I travel for business. For validity sake my flight number originally prior to attempting an earlier flight was DL1384 from GSO to ATL.",2delta-air-lines,20/10/13,Took 4 Delta flights 11/10/13 London - Minneapolis - Las Vegas 15/10/13 Las Vegas - Atlanta - London. First time experiencing flying with Delta and it was very disappointing. Like previous comments booked ticket through KLM/Air France where we have always receive a brilliant service. Wondering why they have partnered with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever so rude cabin crew. Nobody at the entrance to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not a single smile and very abrupt cabin crew members. The only good thing was they had a good selection of entertainment at least it kept our mind away from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a domestic flight compared to the opposite for the international flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not a single smile from the ground crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. International flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this time at the entrance and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was waiting for me as soon as I popped down the seat tray in front of me to read. Yes it was messy with food stain and dry sauce on it from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done pretty much straight away but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew. What was more intriguing was the contrast of service between the domestic and the international flights. Will not recommend it to any friends or family.,3delta-air-lines,20/10/13,Flight DL241 from Rome to Atlanta. Great flight and service from stewards. We even couldn't fill the 11 hour flight. Great attitude and always busy.,10delta-air-lines,20/10/13,Poor customer service. Sold my seat to someone who was on standby in a complete and utter shambles mix up. Had to ask people to leave the plane for compensation. Poor attitude of staff not helpful at all no empathy for customers situations. Poor service on flights entertainment not working and having to reboot seems to be a daily problem. Planes were dirty and tired. Food was average breakfast dire scrambled egg in a soggy roll after an 8 hour flight. Why not keep it simple with a croissant or pastry or muffin? Wouldn't fly again if I had the choice.,2delta-air-lines,16/10/13,"My disabled husband few up to PA from Dallas. His flight up was delayed in Atlanta because the plane he was supposed to fly out on lost its navigation system and they had to find another. That was bad enough but on his way home he left Harrisburg and flew into Detroit when he got off the plane he asked for a wheelchair and help getting to the gate where his connecting flight was departing and was told ""Just go that way and turn left and you will get to the gate."" He got no help so missed his flight to DFW because he was not able to hurry. He was re- ticketed and had to fly into Atlanta before he could return to Texas. On the flight from Atlanta to DFW he was assigned a seat in the back. I was told it was my fault that my husband couldn't get a wheelchair because I didn't book his flight as a disabled passenger! Like I said before this is not the first time we have had issues with Delta but it will be the last!",delta-air-lines,15/10/13,JFK to LHR leaving 9.10pm 12th Oct. Delta 0005. Have just returned from NY to London and can only agree with the negative reviews. The most rude cabin staff I have ever experienced. We actually got our tickets through Air France and I noticed that another partner was Virgin an airline I use frequently to go to Tokyo with and rate highly. What on Earth are these decent airlines partnering with this outfit for? Food was also terrible and complimentary drink service a joke. The public address system didn't work I see others have commented the same why can't they fix simple things like that? They must know it doesn't work the staff get angry when you ask them to repeat things. A bad end to an otherwise superb visit to the Big Apple.,2delta-air-lines,13/10/13,Flew Delta Connection (ExpressJet) from Gainesville Florida to Atlanta. Flight was on time and actually arrived ahead of schedule. ExpressJet (DBA Delta Connection) much better than when ASA flew this route as Delta Connection.,10delta-air-lines,13/10/13,Took 4 Delta flights over the summer Amsterdam-Boston Boston-Atlanta Atlanta-Chicago and Boston-Amsterdam on each of the flights the cabin crew were very friendly and attentive (especially the Atlanta-Chicago flight) were relaxed and seemed to enjoy their job. Seats on all flights were very comfortable and the inflight entertainment on the two international segments was very comprehensive. Plenty of legroom too. Full meal service and hot towels were provided on the international segments which was much appreciated. Domestically Free drinks and snacks were offered which is really all that was required for these flights. I will recommend Delta to my friends and family and look forward to flying with them again along with their partner KLM they offer an excellent route network.,10delta-air-lines,10/10/13,I booked a flight from Denver Colorado to Rochester NY with a connecting flight in LaGuardia. I booked the flight for my grandfathers funeral that was the next morning. The flight was delayed so I was unable to make my connecting flight. Instead they put me on a flight to Salt Lake City Utah to go to Atlanta Georgia to go to Rochester NY. It took over 20 hours to get from Denver to Rochester there was no compassion for my situation by the Delta airline staff. Horrible customer service. I will never fly Delta again.,delta-air-lines,10/10/13,with a group of 86 flying DL16 and 17 SYD-LAX return Sept/Oct 2013. this is the second large group experience on this route with Delta the last being four years ago. As in the last I have nothing but praise for Delta. Check- ins with lots of excess/oversized luggage were most efficient and very quick indeed. The ground staff at both terminals were polite well trained and accommodating. The self check-in computers in LAX were very intuitive and easy to use. Both flights were on time. Inflight service was excellent. Flying the return route in the back of economy I noted how little wait there was for meals after the service had started. Again the service was not only quick but accommodating and compared very well to Singapore; my personal benchmark. The food was fine for economy class airline fare. The entertainment options were comprehensive. Perhaps the airline could upgrade its earphones a little. Seating was comfortable. The Comfort Economy which I used on the outward bound trip was well and truly worth the money. Most importantly Delta has its own terminal at LAX; meaning you avoid the general admissions hall. This is an excellent reason in itself to choose the airline on the SYD-LAX route.,10delta-air-lines,09/10/13,"I regularly travel between South Africa and the USA always on South African Airways (SAA). I have just travelled on Delta from South Africa to Atlanta. Both the ground staff and cabin staff were appalling. Gives rudeness a whole new meaning. Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off. SAA offers seats in the emergency exit at no charge. Delta uses this as another opportunity to rip off customers. Delta staff do yourselves a favour and travel on SAA to find out how to offer a high lass service.",delta-air-lines,09/10/13,29th Sep from Shanghai to Tokyo on DL296 and from Tokyo to Shanghai by DL295 on 5th Oct. I took the flight to and fro from Shanghai to Tokyo. it was a nice experience. The safety presentation that they provide is really unique. Food Quality was also excellent. Staff was very polite inside the airline but Staff at Tokyo Airport Check-In counters were rude and unfriendly and I hope Delta can do something about it as it spoils the image of the airline. The flights were on time and my kids really enjoyed the in-flight entertainment.,10delta-air-lines,07/10/13,My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again.,1delta-air-lines,07/10/13,October 6 from LAX to ATL-Flight started out fine nothing really to complain about. The stewards were average somewhat snooty. Had a good selection of entertainment. Regular snacks on the plain (peanuts pretzels cookies). The end of the flight was extremely rough due to rain but the captain gave some reassurance. Then we landed with only minutes until our next connecting flight to MGM. This is where our trip took a nasty turn. We arrived at the gate with 20 minutes to spare (our flight was to take off at 8.55) but our flight was delayed 5 minutes so we had some breathing room. Then our flight got delayed another 20 minutes then another hour then at 11.45 (sitting in the terminal for over two hours) they cancelled it. We got a rental car that we could have had two hours ago and been home by now.,3delta-air-lines,06/10/13,6 sectors with Delta in last 3 month. Winnipeg-Minneapolis-Amsterdam on July 10th Amsterdam-Minneapolis-Winnipeg on August 19th then Winnipeg-MSP-LaGuardia on August 27th. All flights except one on time great service provided by cabin crew. On long haul flights hot towels were offered which is very nice touch. Great food and beverages. Bags delivered promptly on arrival. Delta prices and customer service is definitely competitive. Will fly with them again!,9delta-air-lines,02/10/13,Man to SFO via Atlanta. New York to Manchester via Atlanta. Both Manchester flights on A330 very comfortable seating is 2x4x2 with each seat having its own inflight entertainment. Other sectors on A319/b737. Service on all the flights was excellent very friendly staff. A lot better than American. Reserved seats together on all flights when booking saved a lot of problems at check in. Transfer in Atlanta was quick and efficient well within 90 minutes suggested. Flights were a good deal.,9delta-air-lines,29/09/13,AUS to JFK JFK to NCE flight DL 1972 and DL 0082. Return NCE to AMS to ATL to AUS. DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1. In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.,8delta-air-lines,29/09/13,LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR (via Detroit). I purchased the tickets for almost Â£300 cheaper then the British Airways / Virgin Atlantic equivalent - and it was money well saved! To JFK had great pitch in 767 economy great food drink and snacks and the on demand touch screen entertainment meant the flight went really quick. All the internal flights were on 757s and they were as equally as good and all had touch screen on demand entertainment which I wasn't expecting. It's right to say that American airlines have a bad reputation but my perception has changed and when I come back to the USA next year I will fly delta. The product is on par if not better then the other airlines and would recommend them.,10delta-air-lines,29/09/13,I have been a gold member for at least one year. I usually fly every 4 to 6 weeks from DCA to Lagos Nigeria. The food service is extremely poor. Breakfast is disappointing I have now learnt to eat before flying. The airline assumes everyone can eat the cheesy bread served in the AM the rice has practically no taste and the bathrooms are in such a bad state before we land. I have only been upgraded twice on the economy flights. I ask each time and the response is the same 'you may or may not be upgraded and you will be told at the gate'. I flew Air France on the trip before last and even got upgraded on that flight to economy comfort. Delta really does need to appreciate their gold members. I fly delta because of convenience but I'm beginning to think it may not be worth it. Bad food with no absolutely no fringe benefits is quite frustrating especially when other airlines offer much more. To fly long distance every 4 to 6 weeks with no benefits are not worth it.,5delta-air-lines,26/09/13,Whatever happened to schedule integrity? We booked our vacation to St. Martin on Delta because no overnight flights were required. Then they changed their schedule and now we have to overnight in Detroit on the way home. They will do nothing about this inconvenience and expense.,1delta-air-lines,25/09/13,LAX-JFK DL1762 Sep 19 JFK-SEA DL 161 Sep 22. Business elite 767. Excellent experience especially for domestic service. Truly international service with lie flat seats duvets and quite good food. Service was efficient and warm. Would definitely choose this again over most other carriers on these routes.,10delta-air-lines,25/09/13,Seattle (SeaTac) - Paris (CDG): 23 September. Flight was horrible! Low Seat comfort and low quality food. But the worst thing is seat assignment: my girlfriend was behind me and that's how it was for a lot of couples and friends! It's obvious that this is done on purpose in order to earn money from change seat utility during the check-in online.,2delta-air-lines,24/09/13,On both outbound (Atlanta) and inbound (Manchester) the controller in my seat did not work (same fault L/R control not working) fortunately my wife was not using hers so changed seats. Really annoying on longer flights. Service good legroom as ever poor. Atlanta airport terminal improved beyond all measure actually pleasurable experience after zoo on previous occasions.,5delta-air-lines,22/09/13,I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights. Too bad they don't put that much thought and effort in to the actual flying part.,1frontier-airlines,01/08/15,"I wish I could give zero stars but that's not an option. This is the worst possible air carrier you could fly, pay the extra money and take another carrier. Frontier lost our bag in the midst of our best friends wedding, the staff at Denver were horrible and unhelpful. The phone numbers after 5 pm do not work. If you want your luggage lost and poor customer service, this is the air service you would want to choose. I was on the phone with them for about 4 hrs and they transferred me from person to person with no resolution. At the end of the day we never received our luggage. ",1frontier-airlines,29/07/15,"I flew Frontier a few years ago and thought it was a great airline, how things have changed. Outbound - we were about to depart MSP when they started counting and recounting everyone. An hour later they were still counting passengers. Finally told they had a security issue and started checking off everyone's name on the flight. We ended up taking off 2 hours and 15 mins late! On the way return we got to the airport and were told our flight would be 3 hours and 10 mins late. Then told it will be 2 hours 55 mins late, left us waiting in a very small and cramped departure area with no food.",1frontier-airlines,29/07/15,"I would not recommend using this airline. My flight was delayed 6 hours and all I could get was sorry, a $25 food credit, and maybe $100 credit to use for future flight. This airline charged me to checked my bags that have not been refunded and everyone that works for Frontier is acting like it's OK to have people at the airport for more than 6 hours. Cheaper is not always better.",1frontier-airlines,29/07/15,"Forget about choosing your seat during online check-in unless you desire to pay for the privilege. If you elect to not pay, the system chooses for you. Baggage fees: Many so-called low cost airlines now charge baggage fees for carry-on bags, however, it is as if Frontier has a scam to collect extra baggage fees. At no point in the process was it apparent there is a fee for carry-on baggage. I checked-in online and paid checked-bag fees, I did not see anything about fees for carry-on bags. At the check-in desk, the agent said nothing about carry-on bag fees. At the gate I was forced to pay $60 for a small carry-on bag. I was one of at least 6 other passengers who learned this at the gate, all of us were surprised and appalled about the lack of information on this fee. The gate agent told me they aren't req'd to inform passengers about the fee at check-in. He said the cost is $25 if paid online, $40 if paid at the check-in desk, $60 if paid at the gate. If I had known this, I would not have had a carry-on bag. We were 3 passengers with 2 checked bags and 1 small carry-on bag. If we had taken 3 carry-ons, I would have had to pay $180 dollars at the gate. Also, the seats were terrible, and the service reps were cold and uninformative. Last trip with Frontier. ",1frontier-airlines,27/07/15,"Frontier Airlines say their seats don't recline, but Row 13 is the only row where the seats do recline on their A319. I was seated on row 14 and as soon as the flight departed Denver (Flt 612 on July 26), the three people in front of me recline their seats and laughed loudly that they paid $50 more for a first class seats. Row 13 is an exit row. It made the overnight flight very uncomfortable for me since my seat did not recline and my knees were firmly pressed up against the seat in front of me for 3.5 hours. During the beverage service, the flights attendant approached each person saying, ""would you like to purchase a cocktail, soft drink, or snack"". I ordered a water and was surprised to hear her serving wine to the person directly behind me. I looked up at her and said excuse me and she just said, ""I'll be right with you"" with a bit of an attitude. I guess if I paid $4 for the water I would have been served before the person behind me. When you add up the flight, extra costs ($3 for a seat selection, $25 for a carry-on bag, $30 for a checked bag, and $4 for a soda or $6.99 for a beer), I really didn't save anything by flying Frontier. I am most surprised that Frontier apparently charges $50 more for Row 13. It seems very unfair the only row that reclines is Row 13 and anyone seated on Row 14 gets a seat back in there face. I gave it a try, but I will not make that mistake again. Frontier may be a discount carrier, but they are not the cheapest once you start adding in all the extras. Buyer beware.",1frontier-airlines,27/07/15,"We flew Frontier for the first time on 6/23/2015. We were very happy to discover an airline that flew into Trenton N.J. close to our family. The flight up was on time and much more convenient than spending seventeen hours driving one thousand miles in a car. Our return flight was scheduled 6am on 6/30/2015, flight 917 from Trenton to Orlando. We started to board on time but were told to return to the terminal due to a mechanical problem. After waiting three hours with little information from Frontier staff we were told our flight was cancelled!Two staff members from Frontier Airlines were at the gate passing out letters stating Frontier airlines would reimburse passengers up to four hundred dollars for another flight and assist with accommodations so passengers could complete their travel. There was no one from Frontier to assist with anything! Due to the fourth of July holiday we were unable to get on another flight for several days. We felt our only option to return home to Florida was to rent a car and drive one thousand miles.",2frontier-airlines,24/07/15,"Terrible customer service, bag fees cost almost as much as the ticket ($198 for a 1 hour flight from Atlanta to Indianapolis.

A drunken woman walked laps up and down the length of the plane because sitting ""ain't good for your circulational system"". Drinks were overpriced, everything costs extra, but the worst were the seats! The plastic framed, foam rubber cushioned, non-reclining seats, with tray tables the size of smart phones were torturous!

Mother is elderly, so had I not checked her boarding pass, she would have ended up goodness knows where. Secondly, when I arrive in CLT my bag did not arrive with me! No apology, nothing! The rep calls me the next day (July 5th) to tell me the bag had arrived and I should go get it. Of course, it was too late for that being that I was scheduled to return to PHL on Tuesday 7/7.

Frontier goes a step forward and uses the following tactics to foster its revenues: 1) Bait and switch schedules. 2) Nickel and dime everything from seat selection, food, beverages, and carry on bags. My family booked a flight back in January for a journey in April. We thought we got a good price and a schedule that fit our needs. Few weeks later we were contacted by our travel agent to inform us that Frontier had canceled the return flight. We were offered the following choices: 1) Go on a flight the following day - Frontier would not compensate for any added expenses. 2) Cancel for no charge and rebook on another airline for an additional $400, because tickets prices had increased in the interim. We were pretty much forced to go with option 1. Also, while doing an online check-in the Frontier system pretty much ""confuses"" you into paying unnecessary fees. We had the foresight to skip that process during seat selection, whereby it automatically assigned us a seat without additional fees. We were not so lucky as it suckered us to pay cabin baggage fees that no one bothered to check at the gates and smarter passengers had avoided. Essentially the system threatens you will be charged more at the gate and that you are better of paying online. I'd take my chances at the gate. ",1frontier-airlines,23/06/15,"If you're traveling for business, or travel where you need travel to be on time and reliable don't fly Frontier Airlines. My wife and I made the mistake of booking Frontier Airlines for our honeymoon. We had our flight information changed 3 times. They changed the whole day of travel, causing us to have to reschedule our motel, they changed times on us and then on the week of my wedding when we had enough other things going on they changed our flight times just a few days before we left. I called to ask them about this and they offered no explanation.  I can't imagine using them again when I need a reliable flight.",1frontier-airlines,22/06/15,"I compared Frontier with other airlines before purchasing my ticket. I paid $253 for a round-trip ticket from Washington-Dulles to Orland- which included upcharges for a seats $40 ($20 each way) and a checked bag fee of $50 ($25 each way). I checked in and boarded without a problem. The seats are incredibly thin and hard.  I was in row 6 and the seats don't recline. There are no TVs in the headrest and no inflight entertainment. I arrived to the airport for the flight back extremely early as the rest of my family was driving back and Frontier only has only one flight departing Orlando at 8:40PM. Around 8, I was texting my parents in DC and they told me they lost power because of a storm. There was no agent at the gate to tell us the status of our flight. At 8:30 there was still no gate agent. Then with no announcement and no gate agent present, the flight went from saying ""on time"" to 11:40PM. People started to get panicky. A little after 9PM finally a gate agent comes up and gets on the loud speaker and says ""Your flight has been cancelled, please see an agent to rebook your flight."" I went back to check-in and the agents were confused. ""We didn't know the flight was cancelled. We're just finding out like you. You need to call customer service.""  Since there is only one departing flight per day, I knew the rebooking situation would be bleak. So, I decided to get a hotel room rather than spend 24hrs in the airport. It was after 10PM before I checked in. I then spent over an hour on the phone with customer service, who rebooked me on the 8:40PM flight for the following night. But the thought of spending another 10hrs+ in the airport literally brought me to tears. So I booked a one-way ticket on US Airways to DCA. Attempting to save $100, ended up costing me more than $340 - not to mention meals while I was waiting. In the end Frontier credited me $56 to use on a future fare, which I will never use because I'm never flying with them again.",1frontier-airlines,20/06/15,"First time on Frontier, Tampa to Cleveland. Went ""Classic"" which included free bag check-in, assigned seat (in ""Stretch Seating"", aisles 1-4), and Zone 1 boarding. Inbound aircraft was late. The other plane at TPA due for DEN was 3 hours late to properly rest the crew (obviously late the night before inbound). The one good thing were the seats, very comfortable and in dark green leather, with plenty of leg room, at least in the ""Stretch"" area. Cabin service was mediocre, $4.49 for an oversized Rice Crispie treat and a cup of coffee (and the stewardess had forgotten the coffee, granted a mistake, until being reminded, and she was very apologetic about it). Timekeeping is a problem at Frontier, this seems to be a regular thing. Would only fly them non-stop, and have contingency plans at the ready.",4frontier-airlines,18/06/15,"I have never written a review, much less a negative one, before. Frontier used to be a great airline from start to finish. Found out they were bought by Spirit, considered the rock bottom airline.

",1frontier-airlines,17/06/15,"Horrible customer service, horrible planes. I was flying from San Francisco to Orlando with a layover in Denver (at least that's what it said on our itinerary email). We're then told there's actually two stops, one in Denver, one in Chicago. The flight from Denver to Chicago was 2 hours late. Then we sat for an hour on the tarmac. Then we arrive at Chicago and they tell us our flight to Orlando left 3 hours ago - they knew they were sending us to Chicago when the last flight to Orlando had already left. There were no apologies issued at any point, they just kept insisting that it was due to weather. Then of course they did not offer any refund, or partial refund, credits, nothing. The employees ""helping"" us get out of this fiasco were rude. They kept telling us there were no more flights until Wednesday (this was taking place on Monday). Other passengers started just booking flights on other airlines and when most of them had disappeared they actually started helping us.

Complimentary hotel due to the fact that we are now Stuck in New Orleans overnight? Nope. Complimentary meal tickets? Nope. Flight out in the morning? Nope. Refund?

When I got on board I was pleasantly surprised with the leather, or what appeared to be leather, seats and they were very comfortable. The flight staff were very attentive and the flight was smooth as glass. So I'm glad I had what seems to be one of the rare good flights. No problems except for the delay. Would have spent way more money driving down and didn't have that long drive. I'm satisfied!",8frontier-airlines,11/06/15,"Frontier has officially landed at the absolute bottom of the airlines.  Planes have recently been ""remodelled"" to include hard plastic seats that don't recline and tray tables that are the width of a cup.  On our last flight from Las Vegas to Cleveland, we arrived early (big mistake).  Ours may have been the only boarding passes printed with the wrong gate.  When we finally realized it, the plane was pulling away from the gate.  No announcement or email message (but they can bombard me with ads on my email account).  Next plane was nine hours later (overnight).  And to add insult to injury, charged us a $75 per person change fee.  No offer to food or hotel or alternate airline.  Just tough luck.
",1frontier-airlines,11/06/15,"Sure, you might expect that when booking with an ""ultra low fare"" airline that it will be skimpy. Come on, though. Charging for a carry on? Does the airline actually think people travel with only a purse or briefcase? Of course not. Just add $35 to the price of the ticket. And for coffee? The flight attendant actually told me that one cup pays for the whole pot. That piece of data is not surprising, but the fact that she told me only reinforced my observation that the majority of the staff of Frontier display an embarrassed, apologetic demeanour. I would too. There is just no room for this type of nickel and dime approach in a competitive space. Cheers to Southwest for not going this direction. At some point Frontier will run out of first time fliers to fool with their supposed lower rates. Then, everyone will have made the same decision I have made: never fly them again.",1frontier-airlines,07/06/15,I had to plan a cheap trip from Texas to Delaware. I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to get through security and get to my gate however the line to get my ticket from Frontiers desk at IAH was long. No one was at the front because it is their policy at IAH to not take customers until two hours before the next flight. When I finally got my ticket I found out I had to pay an additional $35 to carry my suitcase on the plane because the ticket prices do not include carry ons. I guess Frontier thinks people that travel do not need to take anything with them. Then I had to get through security which the lines were long. By the time I got to my gate the plane was already boarding. My return flight I had to pay another additional $35 for my carry on. My total price for my ticket went up by $70. If I had known that I would have gotten a ticket through Delta or US Airlines. I will never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,06/06/15,"Flight 506. Denver to LaGuardia May 15th. Don't fly frontier! The arm rest has been reduced to less than an inch in width the seats are plastic without any comfort and they don't even recline. The tray table is only 4"" in depth which I guess is all you need for the extra small cup of water you get which is the only complimentary beverage. No snacks no inflight TV no business or first class and actually no class whatsoever.

The seats were uncomfortable my seat woul not recline and it was hard as a rock. The hidden charges made the flight overly expensive added 90 dollars to my trip each way for seat choice and small bag carry-on. The service was terrible and no one around to answer questions at the Chicago airport. I ordered a Chardonnay off the menu and it came in a can with a gorilla face on it marked white wine and it had bubbles in it I took one sip and could not drink the rest it was horrible a waste of $7.

No complementary anything was offered. Worst planes. Now the seats are very small the tray in front of you only hold 2 cups. My last time flying with Frontier.,frontier-airlines,31/05/15,First time flying with them and my last. I was flying from Atlanta to Orlando could not check in online. Kiosks were not working so I stood in line to check in and the attendant gave me attitude for coming to the desk. The airline gave me the incorrect gate number and once I figured out which gate I needed to go to the airline changed it and we had to move - very unorganized. Once they found a gate for us the plane was delayed 2 hours for mechanical issues. No one informed passengers of the delay. I wouldn't have know except that my smart phone informed me. After waiting 2 hours we boarded sat for 30 more minutes before going out to the runway. Once there we were told the plane still had problems so back to the gate we want where we were taken off the plane. I gave up and went home as I am not getting on a broken plane with such unorganized and rude staff. The plane was supposed to depart at 12:15 it is now 6.30 and it still hasn't left Atlanta. I will never fly with them again. Very unprofessional staff.,frontier-airlines,27/05/15,I had a flight from Miami to Washington Dulles with Frontier. When I searched on google I was a little worried when I booked this flight since the price was only half compared to those of other airlines (even after adding the baggage fee). But nothing was wrong. Perfect flight. Take off and landing on time. Check-in fast. Baggage fast. I have nothing to complain. That they charge for the baggage and the food is quite normal in my opinion. The prices for those services are reasonable. If you accept the cheap airplane tickets they provide that is part of the additional costs one has to accept too. Anyway highly recommend!,10frontier-airlines,22/05/15,My fiancÃ© and I flew from Portland Or to Memphis TN. My first slight shock came when it was apparent that we had to pay for drinks which on every other airline I have flown this was complementary. It also seemed that anything extra had a cost to it. But my biggest complaint was when we were returning home. Our flight was delayed an hour. No announcement was made to the passengers or any explanation was given. When we boarded we waited another half hour to take off due to computer issues. We ended up missing our connecting flight to our home city. It took the customer service reps two hours to give us our stand by tickets and food vouchers. They also were unsure about how the hotel voucher worked. Speaking of hotel they didn't have any rooms in their system for us so the voucher was pretty much pointless. So as a well traveled person I would not recommend this airline to anyone no matter how cheap they are.,frontier-airlines,20/05/15,This was by far the worst travel experience. I flew from ATL to PDX with a connection in Denver. Our flight was delayed by nearly 3 hours and we spent an additional hour on the runway because Frontier was short staffed and could not find anyone to direct the flight out. We were told that our connecting flight was aware of the delay and waiting at the gate for us. Little did we know they rebooked the entire flight before we even departed from Atlanta with no intention of holding the plane. When we arrived there was no gate available and 20 passengers missed their connecting flight. Frontier customer service was extremely rude. They did not offer any vouchers and told customers that all hotels were booked and passengers would have to remain in the airport for up to 2 days. There were elderly and sickly people scattered all over the airport sleeping on floors and chairs. One family had to purchase 6 new tickets on Delta airlines because Frontier did not have a flight to put them on for 2 whole days. Although airfare appears reasonable please keep in mind that there is a seating fee for up to $35. Both carry on bags and checked bags cost between $25-$35. Water is free but all other beverages cost $2.,frontier-airlines,18/05/15,We boarded Frontier flight 607 from Miami on 5/15/15 at 1.08pm. We watched the flight land and unload and within 5 mins we boarded the plane. After everyone boarded this was a full flight the door was shut the captain came on and stated we had to have a tyre change. After over an hour the captain came back on and said we needed to have a 2nd tyre changed. We spent from 1.08pm until 3.40pm on this plane before takeoff on a fully booked airbus shoulder to shoulder very uncomfortable seats and without a single offering of a drink or food item. While I appreciate and understand safety this is absolutely uncalled for! The very least they could have offered was a complimentary drink but no we had to pay $2 for a canned soda. We spent a total of 4 hours on this plane! The seats on Frontier are plastic and very uncomfortable! They also state they are committed to serving customers but that is not what we experienced on this flight. Customer service is lacking.,frontier-airlines,13/05/15,I took Frontier from LAX to DEN to DWT. In all cases the flights were on time and on the way back even running about 5 min early. I had no issues checking in (checked in at a multi airline kiosk-not the solitary Frontier kiosks - at the airport). I booked online for one checked bag which cost me $40 round trip - no fee for carry on within the defined perimeters. My flight left lax at 8pm-I was in the drop bag line at 6pm when they opened and waited 5 min-no hassle. My flight left DWT at 6am-I was in line at 5am at the drop bag line again with a 5min wait and no hassles. The staff at the desks gate and on board attendants were helpful and friendly and answered my questions with no problems. On board I was in row 9-which didn't recline because I was right in front of the exit row. Everyone else's seats reclined but I didn't see this as a huge problem. I stick to water in flight mainly because any food or drink (other than water) causes swelling/ retention. I can tell you a regular 12 oz can of soda was $1.99 or they had combo deals-coffee and a breakfast snack was $4.99 and 2 drinks + 2 snacks was $8.99 (this was in the in-flight menu). I think it's fair they're charging al-a-carte to keep the fares low which I appreciate. There were TV's for every seat and the cost for more than a 2 hour flight was $5.99 for a decent variety of channels. Overall I had a good flight both ways and would recommend Frontier based on this experience.,10frontier-airlines,10/05/15,I took Frontier Airlines from Houston IAH to San Francisco SFO on Saturday May 2nd and returned on Wednesday May 6th. The airline gives complimentary water and was punctual to the destinations. Had no issues with luggage nor seating.,9frontier-airlines,10/05/15,I flew Frontier from SFO-MSY. I had to pay for seats on both flights totalling $70 plus a checked bag fee for both flights totalling $40. On top of a $500 ticket it cost me $110 extra just to get a seat and to check one bag. All the drinks and food on the plane are extra. On top of that when I arrived in New Orleans only half of the passengers received their checked luggage. The rest of us waited over an hour for someone to help us and after that they found our bags in the back of the baggage claim where someone forgot to put them on the carousel. Today (5/7/15) I get to the airport for my return trip - everyone was ready to board when someone comes out at the gate to tell us that our flight was delayed for four hours because Frontier didn't have a crew for the flight. The woman who made the announcement quickly walked away leaving all the passengers standing in disbelief. I go to the ticket counter to have them find a flight from Denver to San Francisco because I was going to miss my connection. I was put on hold 45 minutes and talked to four different people.,frontier-airlines,08/05/15,I've been flying Frontier between Dulles and Orlando on a regular basis (once or twice a month) since they started the service last summer. They are having scheduling issues flights are late 70-80% of the time. They charge for everything since I have no luggage only a computer bag that's ok. I reserve a seat since I don't want a middle one and that recently went from $3 to $8. All this is ok for a two hour flight (beats driving) except that the plane I have been flying on lately has the thinnest most uncomfortable seats I've ever sat on in an airplane. Not sure if this is an exception or this is the new normal? Overall they're ok and the flight delays are becoming shorter and less frequent.,7frontier-airlines,01/05/15,My family and I flew round-trip from Cleveland to Orlando and I am happy to report that we had great experiences on both flights. All Frontier airport staff/flight attendants were very friendly. Neither flight was delayed at all in fact we reached our destination ahead of schedule both times. I will say that we were annoyed by the extra charges for choosing seats (which I did because one of my companions is a very nervous flyer and I didn't want her to be alone) and carry-on bags (which again we did - checking bags is the cheaper option but I prefer the ease of carry-on luggage whenever possible) however getting to/from our destination safely and efficiently is top priority. I would certainly recommend Frontier to others but just make sure you look into all the charges before you book so you know what's coming.,8frontier-airlines,28/04/15,Flew at the end of April 2015 from CVG-LAS round-trip. First experience on Frontier. I had researched pretty well so I knew all about the extra fees. I paid in advance for a checked bag and an upgraded stretch seat. Seat was very average at best but on a long flight the leg space was worth it. It was my first time checking a bag in years as I couldn't justify spending more to carry my bag on. A bit of a hassle but probably would not stop me from flying them again. Flights were on time and went off without complication. They really hustle to turn the planes around quickly. That also means that they don't get cleaned very well as this is the flight crews job. Floor of the plane was filthy and general upkeep was neglected. Definitely no frills but they did get me and my luggage from point A to point B safely and on time.,7frontier-airlines,28/04/15,Denver to Dallas 4/22 flight 124 and from Houston to Denver 4/26 flight 247. I fly Frontier all of the time out of Denver and have never had any issues at all. One of the few carriers to have TVs on every flight. I have never been delayed. It blows my mind that there are so any bad reviews. You just bought an airline ticket for 100's under other carriers and you don't expect to be charged other places? It's not even that terrible of up charges. Yes to pick your seat if you want to and to check or carryon a bag but you still are 100's under other carriers prices. Go into knowing there will be fees it's nowhere near as bad as spirits fees and the prices are cheaper. The planes are nicer and the pilots are top notch.,10frontier-airlines,27/04/15,Always remember that you get what you pay for. This airline lures you with low fares then has lots of add ons. $35 for a carry on #25 for a checked back and also you have to pay to select a seat. Minimal staffing at airport so unable to answer questions. Flight from DEN-LAS delayed 4 hours due to mechanical delay no support from airport staff. Return flight boarded 45 min early with final call 30 min before scheduled departure because they wanted to leave early. Worst turbulence ever on approach into DEN never had with other airlines even in bad weather. Would not recommend. Crew not particularly friendly.,3frontier-airlines,23/04/15,"I have been a ""road warrior"" for over 15 years. My schedule for weekly air travel has been fairly consistent throughout that time-I'm usually on a plane every week. Needless to say I have pretty much flown every airline out there. When we moved to Denver 4 years ago Frontier became my ""go to"" airline. Great staff great service lots of direct flights and they were usually on-time. Wow with the new ownership and pricing model apparently you can kiss all of that goodbye! Sad to say that the best air carrier has completely imploded. Stay away. Do not buy into the cheap airfare inducement.",frontier-airlines,23/04/15,"Worst experience on an airline ever for this frequent traveler. Due to mechanical failure on the aircraft they left us stranded in Orlando in early March. They kept us at bay until they boarded three other flights in their terminal ""pod"" I suppose to thin the crowd that could have got fired up. 5 hours after scheduled departure they told us flight cancelled. They were working on getting hotel accommodations and transportation but could not tell us about return flight info. It was approaching midnight and I had to be back home in the AM. We booked a flight on US Airways who as always took great care of us. We spent the night on the floor in the airport. They do not respond to complaints nor have they made any effort towards remedying their failure. Horrible customer service. Horrible airline.",frontier-airlines,17/04/15,I took a 5 hour flight from Dulles to Vegas. I wasn't sitting with my boyfriend who I booked the flight with. We were delayed nearly 2 hours. The seats were like sitting on a rock and my seat recline was broken. To watch TV was 5.99 to get a soda was 2.99! On the way home we got to sit together but there weren't any TVs and none of the seats reclined. The flight home boarded a hour early and took off early which those of us who were there appreciated but a lot of people got left behind. I will go back to flying with Delta!,2frontier-airlines,17/04/15,Flight F9 1256 4/15/15. I was worried about my flight today after reading all of the negative reviews but I must say that I was pleasantly shocked! This was probably one of the best flights I've experienced flying out of O'Hare airport or other airports for that matter. Our flight even departed a little earlier than planned. It was a pretty early flight so I did sleep the entire way which was very uncomfortable because the seats have little cushion and do not recline. Since I slept throughout my flight it didn't matter to me that there wasn't any entertainment or wifi. Also I like that the cheaper option is to check a bag in. I decided to pay more for a carry on and the process to board and off board is so much faster since many elect the cheaper option to check their bags but also there was plenty room available in the overhead compartments. For the price I paid for the ticket and because I am an anxious flyer pilot skill is more important than the seating or entertainment. The fact that I was able to sleep on a flight which is very rare is important to me. I think Fronteir is exactly what it markets itself as an economy Airbus. Expect to get from point A to point B nothing more. Plan on bringing a pillow and a book to make the flight more comfortable.,8frontier-airlines,16/04/15,March 15 flight #1127. March 20 flight #1126. I booked flights with Frontier Airlines before knowing anything about the airline. My husband researched them and had us very nervous about flying with them due to reports of cancelled and late flights. I called customer service and they were very helpful and courteous. After talking with them I felt comfortable with the reservations. The flight out of Dulles was 30 minutes late but we still arrived in Las Vegas 15 minutes early.

Terrible experience.,3frontier-airlines,14/04/15,The only thing that had any value was my seat and I was by the emergency window. I had great leg space but as for the service on the flight. The flight attendant seemed she didn't really care no smile. As for the pricing it was a cheap flight but everything else cost: the drinks (non-alcohol) on the flight and the snacks. The bags I got charged for every bag. I will not fly Frontier just like I have not flown Alaska Airlines.,1frontier-airlines,14/04/15,Been flying from Orlando to Washington Dulles every week since June their inaugural flight. Never saw such a decline in service. Upgraded seats went. From 25 to 45$. Seats went from a nice leather to a hard smaller seat that does not even recline. Just cram more seats. No leg room. Seven out of ten flights are always delayed. I have three more flights then going back to another airlines. Would rather pay more. Actually everything Frontier charges for it is cheaper to fly elsewhere.,2frontier-airlines,12/04/15,"I am laying on the terminal floor as I type this. I was scheduled to fly to ORD from MCO this evening at 6.45. There were heavy storms in the Midwest so our flight was initially delayed. This happens. However the way this airline handled this delay was nothing short of appalling. The website said the flight would be delayed a little less than an hour. Upon arrival at the gate there is absolutely no info on out flight. Finally after 3 hrs the young woman at the gate tells us that the flight should get to Orlando around 12.15am and that's ""all she knows"". We all wait. Meanwhile the skies are all clear in Chicago and all other flights are starting to get moving. Then at about 11pm we are told that the plane has not yet pushed back in Chicago and is sitting at the gate and now the flight will be around 2:45am. At this point we all start to ask if the flight will be cancelled so we can all make other arrangements and find lodging. The attendant once again says that this is all the info she has. One man asks ""you work for the airline can't you at least call to see if you can find anything out?"" Her response ""no I can't."" She eventually disappears. Then shortly after midnight a man get on the intercom and informs us (very casually) that the flight is cancelled but ""since it has do to with weather we aren't going to make any accommodations for anyone. If you want we can give you s number that you can call to try and figure this out fit yourselves."" They preceded to write down the same 800 number from the website on ripped pieces of paper and hand it out to anyone who asked. In defence of the attendants they seemed like they honestly had no idea what was going on and were just as frustrated as many of the passengers. Upon calling the airline I was put on hold for over 45 mins with no response. All in all it was an awful experience and the incompetence of this airline seemingly knows no bounds. I am currently stuck in Orlando with a choice of paying over $700 for a one way domestic flight or renting a car and driving 20hrs to get home because this airline cancelled my flight and offered no solution or assistance whatsoever. I will never fly Frontier again!",1frontier-airlines,06/04/15,Even though we enjoyed the convenience of the 5 minutes walk between our parking spot and the check-in counter at Trenton Airport having to pay for any checked luggage and specific seats so my partner and I could seat side by side was vexatious.

No notification and no staff around. Finally 1 hour later we were told there wasn't staff for our plane. On my way back home my seat was double sold!

Every seat except middle seats behind the wing have an upgrade fee. Beverage service is poor at best and even a Coke costs $3 (""but you get the whole can""). Bag fees are increasing yet again. As a Denver native I am sad to say I will never fly Frontier again and will discourage anybody else from doing so. Like with Spirit Air Indigo Partners ruined another once great airline. But hey they turn the biggest profit in the industry so screw the passengers.",frontier-airlines,28/03/15,I did not have any baggage to check and my only carry-on was a backpack that fit under the seat. I arrived at SeaTac in plenty of time for my flight so that I could print out my boarding pass (I had already checked in online) only to find that none of the kiosks were working. So I waited over an hour for the counter to open only to be treated to a rep yelling at everyone for not checking in at the kiosk. Finally the other rep got her to listen that the kiosks didn't work. Upon arrival at the airport my flight was listed as on time. After a gate change to clear across the airport we were told that the flight was delayed by 4.5 hours. No one to speak with since no agents at the gate. By 10pm 3 hours post original flight time the flight was listed as delayed another 3 hours! Again no agents to speak with. I had signed up for text/phone/email notifications and none were ever received. We ended up arriving 8 hours after our arrival time. I had to take another day off of work and it was a very long night. The flight crew was pleasant but again no compensation of any kind for our troubles. You would think that if Frontier cared at all about their passengers that we could at least get a free soda. This was my last Frontier flight! Not worth the time and aggravation. We never did get a realistic reason for the delay.,frontier-airlines,28/03/15,Will never fly Frontier Airlines again. We were scheduled to fly to Tucson via Milwaukee to Denver to Tucson. When checking in in Milwaukee we were told our outbound Milwaukee to Denver flight was delayed by two hours. As a result we would miss our Denver to Tucson flight. For the next 75 minutes we waited to be rebooked on a flight arriving in Tucson 24 hours later. Terrible service. No apologies nothing. You get what you pay for with this airline.,frontier-airlines,23/03/15,I bought my tickets before reading the reviews and when I started to read the reviews I started to regret buying the cheap tickets but it was too late. I flew from Orlando back to Chicago and I have to really say that I'm glad I bought the tickets before reading the reviews or I wouldn't have bought them. High points of the flight? They have a TV and the seats were actually comfortable. I'm a plus size girl and I fit and my legs didn't feel cramped at all. So for those of you who had a bad experience try it again maybe it was a bad day for everyone that day. But do bring your own snacks and drink because the prices are ridiculous onboard.,9frontier-airlines,23/03/15,Frontier Airlines is ranked as a 3 star carrier. Really? On a scale of 1 to 5 stars 3 stars means an airline is average. That has not been my experience on Frontier and I think on a whole the airline is substandard. My recent flight round-trip from PDX to DEN was miserable. They charge for baggage-checked and carry on and they even charge for a cup of coffee or soda! The flight attendants are grumpy and not customer service oriented flights are late without any reason or apologies from the ground crew and leg room is non-existent. Better fares abound on Southwest so choose wisely.,1frontier-airlines,18/03/15,The customer service is unacceptable and unhelpful and the flights are frequently delayed and canceled. This airline will tempt you with lower fares and then make you pay for each carry-on bag and each checked bag as well. It's a tactic that has apparently been working for them because their buyers are ignorant and don't check these things first so please don't be one of those customers like I was. My only advice is turn around and book somewhere else.,frontier-airlines,18/03/15,"I have been a summit member for over ten years. They have methodically reduced all of the benefits for being a frequent flier until they are now nearly non-existent. The staff on the phone when you can get through are tired and it is easy to see that they very much dislike their jobs. The flight attendants on too many of my recent flights are also grumbling and service is sketchy at best. On a recent flight from Denver going south the attendants did not start the beverage service until we were more than two thirds the way to the destination and did not prepare the cabin for landing until the pilot announced ""Attendants please prepare for landing."" Speaking with a number of people we have all encountered hang-ups when trying to speak to an agent.",1frontier-airlines,18/03/15,The usual complaint about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. We packed individually a total of four carry on for a total of $200 round trip and we had to checked them not bring as carry on. Second they changed our returning flight from 11pm to 9am we lost a day of our vacation! Then we had to purchase assigned seats to ensure we sit together. Third they only provide free water everything else had to pay even $3.00 for a can of soda. Only snacks for a 7 hour flight to Las Vegas. Fourth staff did not communicate we had special service stop in Cincinnati and we're told to get out of the plane and then they called us in about 5 minutes to hurry up that we should have never got out of the plane. Six our returning flight was awful we sit inside the airplane for an hour they said it was a light bulb they needed to change. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'3 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour. Seven we had to get out of airplane in Cleveland Ohio for special service again and only had 10 minutes to purchase cold food and drinks for $60. Insane! And then ran back to the same airplane. Eight we finally arrived to Orlando Florida the staff could not tell us were the luggage will be. After we arrived to baggage claim we waited for over an hour! Nine a lot of passengers went to the counter where staff had no idea why the luggage was not available they said that probably they were waiting for other flights! Finally a supervisor came in and her only consolation comment was that we needed to wait 5 more minutes. Everyone was outraged and started asking for their baggage money back. The frontier supervisor started yelling back to all passengers and threat to call police on us. No meal voucher or baggage voucher. We had just keep waiting after a 12 hour trip. Ten this was the worst experience I've had. The cheap flights are always more expensive and service is awful.,frontier-airlines,17/03/15,Flight down to Florida delayed 30 mins because the plane over-fuelled. On the way back flight was delayed for 6 hours then canceled until the next day with no explanation. The Frontier workers wouldn't even come down to the gate to tell us we had to go by the Departure board. Next day flight was delayed 3 hours because the crew was legally required to have a certain amount of time before next flight. If they had to delay flight for 26+ hours you would think the flight would leave on time. Also because so many people just jumped on another flight back they had to role call to see who was on the plane. Never felt less secure on an airplane.,frontier-airlines,17/03/15,"I flew at the last minute from San Diego to Denver. Frontier had better flight time selections and fares than Southwest (won't make that mistake). It was impossible to check in online as the hyperlinks didn't work. I called their ""customer service"" number and after being on hold for 30+ minutes I gave up. I don't understand their baggage and carry on policies and pricing and quickly realized that any money saved by not flying Southwest would be eaten up by these stupid nit picking fees. I finally prevailed on their horrible website and arrived at the airport to hear that their whole software system was brand-new and everyone was trying to figure it out. Then the flight was delayed with no notice to my email or phone. At the gate they had one poor employee trying to handle all these passengers and get the inbound flight all set up to de-plane. This was a bad experience and I will attempt not to fly them ever again.",2frontier-airlines,17/03/15,Where to start? Booked over 4 months ago and was not able to sit with spouse. Charged an extra $30 for a carry on have been sitting to go into the hate at Orlando for over 20 mins now. Got asked once is I wanted a drink but 3 times about trash. Never again!,1frontier-airlines,17/03/15,"Went to Punta Cana from Rockford IL on flight 32 on Feb 27th. Flight was on time and the crew made the experience fun and enjoyable. The stewards were funny and even played ""happy"" when we landed! Now for the flight back to Rockford on March 5th on flight 33 I have to say it was by far my worst experience flying! We not only had a 5.5 hour delay but the pilot mumbled when he addressed the passengers to the point no one had any idea what he was saying. I was in row 9 and it took over 1.5 hours just to get a beverage! They didn't even make it halfway through the plane and had already run out of some snacks soda liquor and of all things ice! We had asked if their were any other seats available because our seats did not recline due to the emergency exit behind us we were informed yes there was but the passenger in the end seat had decided to lay across all the seats and they were not willing to ask this person to sit up! Once we landed we had heard many other passengers say how bad their experience was as well. In my opinion the next time I fly anywhere I will stay far away from flying on Frontier.",1frontier-airlines,17/03/15,What attracted my husband to try Frontier Airline to Vegas was the cheap fare. Sad to say we got what we paid for. I had no problem with a 2 hour delay nor getting our luggage after 10 hours. I do understand this. But poor customer service and waiting over an hour after disembarking to get our checked luggage is too much. Flying Frontier will be my last option the next time I travel.,frontier-airlines,17/03/15,Flight from Cleveland to Denver. Mid day clear skies. They boarded the plane on time. Departure time was no problem but came and went. Captain comes on saying a small paperwork issue. Same story for the next two hours until they made everyone get off the plane. Then their reservation system goes down. Can't get anything but more lying to the passengers. Flight was re scheduled for after midnight. This airline has turned into a really bad airline. So after spending all day being lied to they offer a 10 dollar meal coupon. That will get you a bottle of water and some crackers. No help with booking another airline. Avoid the aggravation and go on another airline. It will be cheaper in the long run.,frontier-airlines,09/03/15,"They were incredibly inconsiderate. The first leg of my flight was delayed by weather at the destination airport yet the second leg departed from that airport ahead of schedule. Half of my flight was told that the next available flight was 24 hours later or that we could go to an alternative airport 1.5 hours from the original destination in 12 hours. No meal voucher no hotel no compensation - we all slept on the floor. The desk attendant's consolation was ""Well it's better you don't have a hotel because you would have had to come back very early in the morning regardless."" Also add the usual complaints about charging more for carry-on luggage but not warning of the charge when purchasing the ticket. The seats were the most uncomfortable I've sat in. I'm 5'10 and 140 pounds and never have a problem yet I was sore after a 2 hour leg. I'd hate to imagine what the larger passengers had to endure.",1frontier-airlines,09/03/15,"New seats do not recline. My friend and I just flew a quick RT CLE-RSW over a four-day span. We paid for seats with extra legroom. What they don't tell you now is that they just ""upgraded"" (their word not mine) their seats for the whole plane and now none of them recline. The FA told me that doing so resulted in them being able to squeeze 9 more seats into the cabin. So - what good is ""extra"" room if it is actually less roomy than previous experience? Very frustrating - I won't be flying Frontier again.",4frontier-airlines,04/03/15,I have never flown Frontier before my trip from CVG to MCO. I was attracted to the airline because of the lower fares which is great for my family of 5. We no issues on the flight to MCO. Fast forward 3 days later on our return flight from MCO to CVG. We arrived at the airport only to find that our flight had been delayed for 2 hours because of maintenance issues. Understandable. From the time we left the main terminal to the gate the delay went from 2 hours to 9.5 hours. Again we were told it was a maintenance issue. The delay changed again to 10.5 hours. It turns out it wasn't a maintenance issue at all it was a crew issue - they don't have a crew to fly the plane. Supposedly the do now (thus the delay). I'm not sure where the plane is - CVG or MCO. The attendant at the gate told me planes are delayed at least once a week because of no crew but usually the delay is shorter than 10.5 hours. I only wish I would have read the reviews before I booked my flight. It can only be a matter of time. Southwest/AirTran and Delta are substantially more reliable and if you have someplace to be it's worth it to pay a little more.,frontier-airlines,04/03/15,Flying from Denver to Chicago round trip. Delayed 6.5 hours to get cancelled. Tried the same flight the next day and so far we are delayed two hours. This is the last time I will fly Frontier. They are really bad.,frontier-airlines,04/03/15,"Frontier 114 February 4th. Do not cross the line into Frontier Land - enticed by the low fares and the thinking of ""these negative reviews can't possibly be true"". They are.

I get the new pricing strategy and I understand the a' la carte idea. They had to do something about the bag war going on for overhead carry on space. What is not excusable is the consistently late flights or worse - the cancellations of which I have been now reading about. Frontier I'm gone. It's sad - they were my savior from United. Southwest - here I come.",frontier-airlines,04/03/15,World Strides trip home from Fort Lauderdale to Dulles International. Flight canceled on 2/21/15 due to weather which is understandable. We were traveling with 32 middle school students and 9 adults. No flight available for 3 days 2/24/15! After a week long event we had students who would need medication before that date (we expressed this to the agent). We had to sleep in the airport that night because there were no hotels available that was not Frontier's fault but having to stay there 2 more nights with 41 people would have been. When discussing flight options with the very nice ticket agent we discovered that not only would we not be able to fly out for 3 days only part of our group could fly out then. Another group would have to fly out on the 4th day and another on the 5th day! This was totally unacceptable. During our lengthy stay in the airport we discovered from other customers (we were camped out right across from the Frontier ticket counter) that almost all customers were delayed the next day (the weather was beautiful) and those who had flown before stated their flights are always delayed (our flight to Orlando was delayed). The lines for check in were crazy long compared to other airlines. People waiting hours to check in. This could have been a marketing dream for Frontier. Imagine the story of helping out a group of stranded middle school students because Frontier cares. Instead they left us stranded for up to 5 days. No refund. No credit. Now 32 parents will never fly Frontier. 9 chaperones will never fly Frontier. For a price gouging company that advertises low prices then charges not only for checked baggage but for carry on bags and charges for water and sodas and basic channel TV I would think Frontier would at least want to retain the customer base they have. I for one will never use Frontier again. The flight attendants and ticket agents are super. The business model is horrendous. They should be ashamed.,1frontier-airlines,04/03/15,"This was my first experience flying Frontier and will be my last. The outbound flight from Cleveland to Phoenix was adequate but it took over 1.5 hours to receive my luggage. The return flight was a disaster. I arrived at 4pm for my 6pm flight only to find that the fight had been changed to 4.10 pm. I was never informed of the change but the agent lied and stated that I had accepted the change. I was forced to fly Delta through Detroit. Frontier offered a small partial refund for my flight but nothing for my Delta flight. I will never fly frontier again. Interestingly my friends have had similar experiences. In fact Frontier has engaged in a classic ""bait and switch"". Frontier initially offers convenient schedules and then changes the flights to save on landing fees. I will be back flying United.",frontier-airlines,24/02/15,This was my first trip with Frontier. We flew from Cleveland to Las Vegas return. I opted for the stretch seats. The flight was delayed slightly on the outbound leg but this was communicated to us before we arrived at the airport. It was really not a problem. The ground staff were friendly and efficient. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The stretch seats were worth every cent of the small supplement payable ($25 per person per leg of the flight). The aircraft was a modern Airbus A320 which was clean and comfortable. The return leg was exactly like the outbound. I will not be giving five stars however. Upon arrival at Cleveland 5.45 am we were directed to a piece of taxiway until a stand could be found for us. The delay amounted to 45 minutes. That is unacceptable at that time of the morning and Frontier and Hopkins need to address it. I will have no hesitation in recommending the airline with that caveat.,8frontier-airlines,18/02/15,"No leg room I am a small 5'2"" female and I felt cramped I felt sorry for my brother-in-law who is 6' tall his knees touched the seat in front of him. Apparently the only thing free on Frontier anymore is water everything else will cost you. I got extremely ill on the return flight and they told me they had no blankets or pillows to offer. My thought what do they do if they have an emergency needs to lay down and be kept warm put them in the aisle? No entertainment at all not even TV or music and a 5 hour layover I will never fly Frontier again.",frontier-airlines,18/02/15,"Do not cross the line into Frontier Land - enticed by the low fares and the thinking of ""these negative reviews can't possibly be true"".

While this has not happened to me I witnessed this first hand - a flight to Oklahoma City from Denver was cancelled. 150 passengers had the rug pulled out from underneath them - I caught this because I was at the next gate over and noticed the customer service center was suddenly packed. Refunds were offered but what you supposed to do now - book another airline at the last minute? That's triple the fare in most cases! Apparently Frontier has no desire or capability to do what other airlines do - get you home on another carrier. Frontier I'm gone. Southwest - here I come.",frontier-airlines,18/02/15,"Our first flight was great but it was only 45 minutes. We sat in the ""extra leg room"" seating but it was just normal seatingâ€_ or so I thought. Our connecting flight had us in the very back row. There there is no leg room whatsoever and your knees are directly against the seat in front of you. They do not offer complimentary snacks or drinks but you can pay for half a can of soda for 2.99. The flight attendant was very rude and patronizing. Not only this but our seats were moved from the front all the way to the back without notification to my family. I do not recommend Frontier to anyone. Pay the extra and take United.",2frontier-airlines,11/02/15,I have only flown this airline once (RT) and will never fly them again. Both times the flight was delayed once by 1/2 hour and once by 2.5 hours. They actually had the nerve to post 'on time' on the electronic board along with the rescheduled departure time. When I questioned the 'on time' the customer service agent said they hadn't yet updated the sign. Um then why does it say 11.30 instead of 9.35? Unfortunately it wasn't until I made my reservation that I noticed a review (1/2 stars) that they are consistently delayed. If you are needing to get somewhere especially if you have a connection I strongly advise you avoid Frontier and if you must pay a little extra for an airline that cares about their customers getting to where they want to go relatively on time.,1frontier-airlines,11/02/15,Where do I begin. So my cousin and I got to Orlando airport at about 11am. We waited in a line for about 39 mins just to be told that we could not check our bags yet. So we waited an hour and went back to the bag drop off line to check our bags. Again we waited about 30 minutes. Luckily we had paid our baggage check fee online so the process went fairly smooth. We were scheduled to leave at 4.10pm to go to IAD. I received an email saying the flight had been delayed to 5.07. Not even 30 minutes later the flight was changed again to 5.27. Eventually I was notified that the flight was canceled. So we went back to the desk to confirm and the board still stated that the flight was on time. By this time the line was obstructing the flow in the airport and wait times were over an hour long. The cancellation was confirmed but we were told that they were not going to be rebooking and flights or giving any refunds. They gave us food vouchers and a hotel voucher and said we had to call a 800 number. I waited to speak with a representative for over 3 hours and still did not get in touch with anyone. They still did not offer any resolution as to how we were going to get home. So finally my cousin and I had to book with another airline in order to get out of Orlando. The workers were very rude. They had no answers whatsoever. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that I had to go to the end of the line and wait until the supervisor had time. This customer service experience was the worst ever.,frontier-airlines,11/02/15,No web service available 2 hr wait on phone given wrong information about seats 4 Sep. seats given separating me from my two children after I was assured that wouldn't happen. Pulled out of line to use kiosk then kiosk didn't work rude woman at desk seats were dirty and falling apart. After buying the tickets we needed to buy seats pay for bags pay for soda TV peanuts overall cost is higher and service is awful. Return flight just as bad gate changed no reason boarding delayed no reason the plane not cleaned between trash at our seats delayed on tarmac due to broken toilet. Seats front was ripped and dirty seat chair very uncomfortable. 4 of 6 TV's broken in my row (23) and agents were making sarcastic comments about the passengers in front of them horribly unprofessional.,frontier-airlines,11/02/15,"Frontier Airlines. Beware: limited flights schedule changes = stranded for 2 days. Frontier delayed our flight by 5 hours due to ""equipment changes"". Naturally I missed my connecting flight to my destination. Frontier graciously offered to book me onto the next connecting flight - 2 days later. The delay was not because of full flights. It was not due to bad weather. They simply had no scheduled flights for 2 days (48 hours). Frontier provided no offer to book on another airline no offer to refund my ticket except for the single connecting leg no offer to compensate for costs on another airline. No voucher no flight credit. I contacted customer service 3 times. I received 5 hours to sleep in a run-down hotel a half hour from the airport and $15 for an airport dinner. Several weeks earlier I had to book a one way return on United because Frontier changed my return to a 16 hour itinerary with a 9 hour layover. Then I had to book a third ticket just to get out of the airport on my outbound - United to the rescue again. Fly Frontier but be prepared to suddenly spend a couple-few days in your layover airport or city. Or be prepared to buy a last minute fare to get to where you were going. Frontier: Discover a whole new way to fly like driving which is faster.",1frontier-airlines,11/02/15,My family of four which includes a 2 year old and an 11 year old just flew Frontier from DFW to Denver in January and paid in advance for seats in the forth row for easy boarding and u boarding due to my youngest and so we could all sit together. My seats were bought and paid for well over a month in advance and confirmed via email. Upon arriving at airport and boarding we were placed in 4 different rows in the very back of the plane. Luckily a fellow passenger switched seats allowing my 2 year old to sit beside my husband. The same thing happened on the return flight even after spending 1 hour and 57 minutes on hold with Frontier to make sure this didn't happen again. The lady on the phone told me that the 4th row did not exist on the return flight and so once again we were shoved in the back of the plane. The 4th row did indeed exist with some very happy passengers sitting in our paid for seats! Not a happy Frontier past customer!,frontier-airlines,11/02/15,"My original flight from Chicago was supposed to get me home on Sunday night but was cancelled due to weather despite other airlines flying out. The agents in Chicago were completely unhelpful and utterly lacking in empathy or any semblance of customer service. My only options were a flight two days later (with no food hotel or transportation vouchers provided) or to book with another airline. I didn't have the money to rebook a last minute flight across the county and had to swallow the cost of a cheap nearby hotel with a shuttle. However when I went back to the airport two days later it was to find that my flight was massively delayed due to ""weather"" again despite other airlines having no problems. This makes no sense to me and makes it appear that Frontier just sticks the words ""weather related"" in front of any problem to avoid having to take any responsibility for their delays and cancellations. My flight was delayed more than four hours (with no food vouchers offered) and sat on the runway for a further hour and a half with everyone aboard while the plane de-iced. I asked Frontier agents in Chicago before I left that if their delays caused me to miss my connection in Denver if I would be provided a hotel voucher. I was assured that I would. However when I arrived in Denver myself and the 15-20 others who had missed connections were offered no vouchers or assistance but only extremely impatient and disrespectful service from Frontier agents. I ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport waiting until the following night for my flight. I'm currently sitting in the airport waiting for my flight and have just found out that it's of course delayed. I'll never fly it again. The cancellations delays lack of communication disorganization and horrible customer service are absolutely startling.",frontier-airlines,11/02/15,First they delayed our flight leaving Milwaukee to Denver. Then we miss the connecting to Bozeman. Since Frontier does not and will not work with any other airlines we were stuck in Denver because the next Frontier flight to Bozeman was a day an a half away. Very unhelpful and horrible customer service. The only thing they offered was a discount on the next trip. Will never use this airline again. The connecting flight only needed to wait an extra 15 min for us. No beverage service for a two hour ride.,frontier-airlines,06/02/15,This nickel and dime airline is the definition of Caveat emptor. In hindsight I should have read the reviews rather than enduring the abominable travel experience between MCO and LAX with a layover in lovely Denver. I can only reiterate what so many have said before. The cheaper price is what hooked me but I would have rather paid the difference for another airline because in the end I probably spent about the same. Frontier reeks of cheapness with no complimentary snacks zero legroom and Direct TV only available to those willing to dish out even more money. The flight attendants barked orders and scowled and the customer service couldn't be more useless. When I asked to move to an earlier flight they informed me it would be an additional $75 per ticket as they do not offer stand-by. So while I wait for my later flight I decided to make good use and warn any curious travelers to avoid this airline at all cost. For me I can say this will definitely be my final Frontier. The best thing I can take away is the valuable lesson to always look before you book.,frontier-airlines,30/01/15,"My husband and I booked two round-trip itineraries from Denver to Ft. Lauderdale last September for travel this coming March. Just 8 days after the booking Frontier changed our flight destination to Miami and we were told they would not provide a way to get us from Miami to Ft. Lauderdale. Despite the added cost and inconvenience we accepted the flight change. Since that time our flight itineraries have changed 3 more times (that's 4 itinerary changes in 4 months and counting). Today we were informed that our non-stop flight has changed to a 3-leg itinerary flying from Denver to Indiana to Alabama to Miami. We are now arriving over five hours late and in a different city! I waited over an hour to speak with an unsympathetic customer service rep (as is typically the case) who could offer no acceptable remedies and no explanation other than ""they are making many schedule changes at the moment"". Once upon a time I loved this airline! I was one of their elite frequent flyer members and flew them almost exclusively.

We were ready to leave and my sister checked to make sure our flight was on time to find out they had cancelled it due to mechanical problems. No email no phone call nothing. We found out that they no longer affiliated with other airlines so we would have to wait and fly out 24 hrs later! We had already paid for a room in Vegas had 2 people already waiting in Vegas for us and were only going to be in Vegas for 3 nights so we had to rush and book a flight on Delta. Not to mention that on Frontiers flights you have to pay for carryon luggage picking your seats if you want anything to drink. This party of 6 will never fly with Frontier again!,frontier-airlines,26/01/15,We were supposed to leave Orlando at 9.30am. I checked the website before we left for the airport and it showed a 30 minute delay. By the time we got to the airport it had been pushed back twice more totalling a 1.5 hour delay. I looked at the screens inside the airport to see where the flight stood before we checked our bags. It showed our flight was on time. We went to the ticket counter to check our bags and there was no mention of a delay. We went through security and made our way to our gate. Still no mention of a delay. At the gate our flight didn't show up but instead they had a flight leaving an hour after our scheduled departure. I made my way to the counter and it was the first time Frontier acknowledged there was a delay. After being told nothing I had to keep checking the website for updates. The flight was pushed to 12.00 then to 3.30 then to 6.30 and eventually to 7.30. I did over hear a couple walking away from the counter saying Frontier was flying a part from Denver to Cleveland hoping that would fix the problem. They couldn't arrange for a plane to take us to Cleveland we had to wait for that same plane. The poor folks in Cleveland were in the same boat we were in Orlando. We rebooked on another airline and I lost track of when if ever our original flight left. Last I heard it was delayed 10 hours and counting. They never updated us as we sat waiting and you had to wait an hour plus on the phone to cancel your seat to be eligible for reimbursement. The reimbursement was meagre to say the least. It only covered a fraction of what I paid to fly home.,1frontier-airlines,23/01/15,"Flight from Miami to Philadelphia 1/18 after a cruise. Arrived at airport at 11 am for 8.30 pm flight. Couldn't check in bags until 3 hours before flight. Learned flight delayed until 1 am. Checked in bags at 6 for flight told flight delayed until 4 am. Frontier was supposed to text delays but did not. Offered to refund money and cancel our flight but couldn't reschedule us to leave for 3 days. Arrived for 4 am flight delayed until 5 because of ""security issues with plane"". Never explained delays. Last Frontier flight for us.",frontier-airlines,23/01/15,I used Orbitz.com to buy round trip tickets from Raleigh to Trenton price was great. No complaints about the flight into Trenton however I was notified hours before it was time to return home that my flight had been cancelled. There were no weather issues the representative could not tell me why the flight had been cancelled. I explained that I had checked out of the hotel and had nowhere to go I asked the Frontier representative to connect me with another airline or to cover my hotel expenses and received no assistance whatsoever. The next available flight was 2 days later. I ended up having to stay in a hotel another night and used AMTRAK to return home that morning. I will never use Frontier again this way of doing business was unexpected and I was totally unprepared. The cheap fare turned out quite costly.,frontier-airlines,19/01/15,After repeated late and canceled flights I will no longer fly Frontier. Their ticket prices are cheaper but if you can't reach your final destination (like I was unable to) then it ends up costing you more in the long run. After a delayed 3 hour flight and missing my connection I was forced to cancel my trip to Vegas since I couldn't get on another flight for another day and a half! I have never flown on a Frontier flight that has arrived on time yet. Will not use again.,frontier-airlines,14/01/15,"I am a business traveler with over one million lifetime miles spread over several airlines. I am a Frontier Summit member and have had that status over the last several years. In the early days I found the airline to be of good quality. Under the new management Frontier has plummeted in my estimation under this guise of ""low cost"". First it is not low cost when the ""nickel and dime"" charges are added in. The under-staffing at my home airport (DIA) and the various regional airports is quite apparent. If one talks to staff or flight attendants the low morale becomes apparent. Needless to say I have a few award miles to spend and then it is adiÃ_s to Frontier. What a shame that an airline that was of reasonable quality has been driven down by these new owners.",2frontier-airlines,14/01/15,Came back from Chicago on Monday Dec 29. Was a great flight arrived into Orlando 10 minutes early the crew were friendly. Would take Frontier again.,9frontier-airlines,14/01/15,Flew round trip from Trenton to Raleigh for $89. The flight was on time and coming home I was actually late to my plane and they waited an extra couple minutes to allow me to board. Would definitely use them again. Prices are unbeatable. Complaints are from those expecting a commercial airline. This is a discount airline and you get what you pay for. Our family uses Frontier for business as well and have never had an issue.,10frontier-airlines,11/01/15,Terrible service. Did not inform us that we have to pay for carry on bags ($35). Not enough staff to help you to check in. Our flight was supposed to board at 5.40. At 5.40 they started boarding a plane going to a different location at our gate. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6.15 and the flight they began to board was leaving at 6.30. We had to stand around and wait to board after their flight left at 6.30. We didn't leave until 7. Very disorganized. Anytime anyone asked what was going on they sent us away with no explanation. It wasn't until after 6 when they informed us of the other plane. Never fly Frontier!,frontier-airlines,11/01/15,"Flew on a Saturday Jan 3 2015. Flight was delayed in Houston because of ""weather"". Missed our connection in Denver Frontier said the next available flight to Seattle was Jan 6th. Would not put us up in hotel. Frontier lied to us it was a mechanical issue in Bozeman that started it all that was from the Pilot. Plane finally loaded but after sitting for 30 mins on runway the pilot told us she had reached her limit on hours went back to gate and sat for 1 hour before they rescheduled flight to next morning Frontier didn't pay for hotel rooms. At airport the next morning Frontier board the plane going to Denver with passengers going to San Francisco had to de-plane and remove all luggage. Finally took off.",frontier-airlines,05/01/15,This was my first experience with Frontier. Even though I saw bad reviews I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it out. I booked online through Orbitz and my reservations never made it into the Frontier online system. I could not access my info so I had to use their 800 number for dealings. I paid $40 to upgrade my seat selection and another $20 for my checked bag at check-in. The only part of their online system that worked was online check-in but I had to try twice before it actually worked. At my departure I waited 45 minutes to drop my bag. The customer service was unorganized and rude. Why check and pay ahead of time if I still have to stand in the same line as those who haven't? At the departure gate it got worse. The screen displayed the flight information and they announced boarding so I naturally proceeded to the line. I was zone 1 and when the agent scanned my boarding pass he abruptly informed me that this was not my flight. It was in fact a delayed flight that was supposed to already be in the air. The screen continued to show my flight info and half the people in line were misinformed about where the plane was actually going. We were told that our plane was at the airport and would arrive at the gate once this plane had left. Meanwhile our captain co-pilot and flight attendants were also sitting in the waiting area and had no clue where the plane was. They were laughing and joking (rather loudly) about the delayed status and disorganization of the airline. Everything was very unprofessional. An hour after our scheduled departure we finally took off. I still have to take my returning flight so I hope they will redeem themselves. I will never ever book a flight with Frontier again!,1frontier-airlines,05/01/15,Terrible airline. Will never fly again. On one of the busiest days of the year Frontier delayed our departure for almost 4 hours and then cancelled. Since they have no airline affiliations they couldn't offer any other travel options only option was a flight two days later or refund of ticket. They gave us our money back but it doesn't exactly cover the loss of our vacation planned months in advance. I've learned to always check if the airline has co-operating airlines with which they can rebook passengers.,frontier-airlines,31/12/14,This is the first time I took the new version of frontier. The experience is not at all good not on par with other airlines. I will gladly pay the extra $50 next time to go with a better carrier. My flight was delayed by more than two hours. I only found out about the delay at the airport when I picked up my boarding pass. Desk agent didn't tell me you figure it out on your own from the hour-later boarding time on your boarding card. No one at the gate and the gate monitor said flight on time for a whole hour while I waited. Then told the flight was delayed another hour. Still Frontier doesn't show the delay. Reason for the delay? None I could find. All the other flights in this concourse were on time. Not a happy customer and I will not be back. I rate even Spirit better than this.,frontier-airlines,29/12/14,Horrible customer service and lack of empathy for guests flying with them. Flight was scheduled to leave at 12.40 to Georgia and was delayed until 1.11 pm. Around that boarding time the announcer made another call to let everyone know that the flight would further be delayed until around 4.30 pm due to the incoming aircraft having a cracked windshield. If they were aware of the situation beforehand why lie to the entire crowd of people waiting and expecting the initial delayed flight to depart at 1.11. To further add insult Frontier never offered any service recovery discounts fee waiver etc. Their guest service and accommodations are terrible. Many people were complaining to the staff that they were on a tight schedule for weddings birthdays etc and Frontier Airlines did nothing to help myself or those guests. Never again will I be flying with this airline.,1frontier-airlines,22/12/14,Trip from Atlanta to Denver. No issues in Atlanta crew was very nice. In Denver the desk staff were borderline rude and wouldn't acknowledge you unless you use the kiosk to print the boarding pass but no one was willing to explain how to use the kiosk. Then had to reprint the boarding pass at the kiosk for unexplained reasons. I want to deal with people not computers. Desk staff was rude in Denver but flight crew was refreshing. Flight from Atlanta was actually early and return flight was on time.,7frontier-airlines,22/12/14,Flight 133 Dec 2 Dallas DFW-Denver DEN. Flight 657 Dec 2 Denver DEN-San Francisco SFO. Very unimpressed. They charge for carry-on bags which is bad enough but they actually charge more for carry-ons than checked bags. The employees I encountered were very unfriendly and unhelpful. And lastly they charge for everything but water. Bad experience overall.,2frontier-airlines,18/12/14,"After arriving at Dulles it took well over an hour to get luggage off loaded from the plane. When we finally found someone who worked for Frontier they advised that baggage is contracted out at Dulles. We were told that there were only 2 people working baggage as they had ""a bunch of people call in sick."" They waited for 3 planes to land and unloaded all 3 planes before sending bags to the carousels. It took so long that the hotel shuttle left and I had to pay for a cab. Return flight after a 20+ hour international flight I was told I could not check my luggage through on my final leg until 2 hours before the flight. Family connecting with Delta and Southwest checked their bags immediately. I had to sit in the airport lobby for 5 hours before I could check my 1 bag. I will try to avoid flying Frontier in the future!",1frontier-airlines,18/12/14,I am a frequent business traveler and I will never fly Frontier again. Having to pay for carry on luggage is ridiculous. If they are trying to reduce the number of carry-ons then they should just allow 1 free checked bag. But that wasn't the most frustrating thing. Even though I checked a bag on line and had my printed receipt I had to re-check the bag at least he kiosk at Denver because I was told that was the only way they could print my baggage tag. If that's true then I'm going to fly an airline with the capability of printing their own baggage tags from this point on!,2frontier-airlines,04/12/14,$30 for a carry on drinks $2 and up snacks you also have to pay. I didn't select a seat to upgrade the first time and I was put in the back of the plane. On the way back home I paid for an upgrade seat and it didn't recline back.,frontier-airlines,01/12/14,I honestly can't complain. We paid for seats that didn't have much legroom. Because they were only $3. I would say we got what we paid for. Nothing was complimentary other than the water. The flight attendants were nice and we got from LAX to Denver right on time. We paid for carry on. We followed the instructions on measurements and weight of our luggage. We had no problems whatsoever.,9frontier-airlines,25/11/14,"I am a frequent traveler. I booked round trip tickets for two. The first flight was to leave at 6.05 am. We loaded on time but sat on the runway for 2 hours while the computers ""rebooted"". This delay of course caused us to miss our connection flight in Denver. Causing us to miss much of the first day activities. On our return flight we made it out of LAX on time on arrival in Denver it appears that our connection flight was on time. 30 min after we landed our flight was delayed for 5+ hours. No explanation was given to us. They did give us $15 food coupons 45 min before all restaurants closed ""after we had already paid for our meals"". Every gate in the Terminal had an unused plane sitting at it. Not any cheaper "" when you count baggage fees"" than any other carrier and I have never had so much trouble keeping a schedule. There was no weather in any part of the country by the way. We haven't made it on the delayed flight yet. Entirely possible that we didn't make the 3am flight either. Avoid at all cost.",1frontier-airlines,20/11/14,This was my first time flying Frontier and perhaps my last. My main complaint was assistance for customers with reduced mobility. I am a stroke survivor and was forced to walk up stairs because there was no ramp. The crew offered no help. Also you could board the plane from either the back or front. It was confusing because people bump into each other trying to store their luggage.,5frontier-airlines,20/11/14,My reservation was lost although they billed my card twice and I had to pay the higher last minute fare. Both flights delayed. They lost my luggage and it was not found for 3 days. There is no on site help desk for lost luggage just a phone number (not toll free) which no one answers after leaving a handful of messages. After returning to the airport the next day I was told to call the complaint number - it is only open for 3 hours a day and a recording told me there was an hour wait. Fly an airline that is customer centric if you don't want to get surprised like I did.,1frontier-airlines,17/11/14,Frontier should be ashamed of their lack of customer assistance at Chicago ORD on October 31 2014. The customers were completely aware of the fact that all airlines were not able to land or take off due to heavy winds. That was not the problem. We were frustrated by the fact that nobody showed up at the Frontier gate until 7.30 pm and our flight that was originally scheduled for 4.10 was changed 3 times before a Frontier staff member made an appearance at the gate. On my return flight on November 4 we were expecting to board at 7:10 as stated on the boarding pass but there was no gate agent available again. Then every passenger who had paid to bring carry on luggage was asked to fit their bag into the measurement apparatus at the gate - the delay was ridiculous.,4frontier-airlines,17/11/14,Frontier Airlines poor planning in notifying its passengers in a timely manner is ridiculous. Frontier waited until 6.30 am to make an announcement to its passengers about the flight being delayed due to crew rest. Boarding time was scheduled for 7.10 and flight schedule to leave 7.45 am moved to 8.55 am. So why didn't the airline notify customers via phone (text) or email concerning this change so that passengers could have stayed at their hotels or homes little longer. Why ask for phone number when check in online if you not going to use for that purpose. Ridiculous Frontier Airlines and inconsiderate of your customers.,frontier-airlines,11/11/14,Flew Frontier Denver to Seattle - Oct 7 - Oct 22. Both flights were great! Love online check in - member of Rewards Club so $15 bag. I think the problems that others may experience are back east more than the original Frontier areas. Has some very decent employees. Enjoyed the flights and will travel with them again.,10frontier-airlines,06/11/14,Three of us travelled round trip on Frontier between Washington Dulles and Fort Myers Florida. Our experience was excellent. Frontier was not only $100 cheaper per ticket than any other airline flying the same route but it was also the only airline offering direct service. We opted not to reserve seats to save money yet when we checked in Frontier assigned us seats together. Usually when traveling each of us would have brought a separate carry on bags but because Frontier charges for carry on as well as checked bags we opted to share a large checked bag for the same cost as a single carryon. Boarding was orderly the plane clean the crew pleasant and the flight was on time. We definitely will use Frontier again.,10frontier-airlines,03/11/14,I'm a frequent flyer so for me to say that this is by far the worst airline I have ever traveled on is quite accurate. Where do I even begin? After purchasing a ticket that was supposed to have one free bag checked I was told at check in that I'd have to pay $25 to check in my bag. In addition I was told had to either pay $35 for my carry on or get it checked in for $30. Are you kidding me? That's already 3/4 my ticket. Then I arrive at the gate just to find out there was a delay. Not to mention the customer service was rude and made us wait 30 minutes in line to check in. Please if you care about your money and time do not fly with this airline. They rip you off completely and are shameless about it. Please spare yourself the trouble.,frontier-airlines,03/11/14,Drove to Chicago on 10/24 and paid for a hotel to be at O'Hare by 5am 10/25 for a 7.30 direct flight to Cancun. Due to a scratch on the nose of the plane that we were told would take 45 minutes to fix we waited and waited until finally leaving at 5.30pm. Instead of being at our resort by 1pm we arrive there after 10pm. While delays can be expected with any airline a 10 hour delay was ridiculous. The gate agents were rude and aside from a food coupon for each passenger they did nothing. Our vacation was cut short by an entire day. The agents announced that if we wanted to complain to call the travel agency. I will avoid Frontier. We've flown extensively and again delays happen. But not 10 hours and if it did happen I'd think they would do more than give you an attitude and a cheesy food voucher. Very disappointed.,frontier-airlines,31/10/14,"Just flew SLC - Denver. Paid extra for classic plus which was to include early seating extra leg room free checked bag and carry on and one free alcohol drink and other drinks free. Guess what: after 22nd of this month - no free drinks. ""Didn't I get the email?"" How can Frontier just take away something I paid extra for? Will avoid this airline if at all possible.",frontier-airlines,28/10/14,My Frontier flight was scheduled about 3 hours after a long intercontinental flight to Denver supposed landing and I was really scared after reading all bad reviews. However the experience was very nice. We did not do online check-in but it took literally 1 minute to check-in on the counter. When making a reservation I paid for carry- on items instead of check-in. When I found that out I called and wrote to customer service and they told I'll be able to check my item in and so it was. The staff were helpful the flight departed and landed without delays. When we landed one of the bags was damaged (whichI think is not airline responsibility). We went to Frontier representatives in Bozeman airport (it was around 11 pm)and they just brought us a new bag. You have to pay for carry-on and check-in baggage and drinks but the ticket price is still good.,10frontier-airlines,28/10/14,"Arrived two hours early for a flight from O'Hare to Dulles. We had pre-printed our boarding passes and paid for our additional checked luggage. We simply need to check the luggage at the counter. Our party of five - along with several others were redirected out of the line to some type of ""domestic"" holding area as they attended to an international flight. About a half hour into our wait the redirection stopped. However those of us in the holding area were left to stand there for another half an hour without further direction. There must have been twenty travelers that arrived well after we did that found their way in front of us in a very long line. My son- in-law took matters into his own hands as it was obvious that the Frontier service reps had no intention of returning for us. Had it not been for his negotiating with the people in line we all might still be sitting there. Upon arrival at our destination we sat at the gate for a half an hour before de-boarding. Despite this wait we waited an additional 40 minutes for luggage to begin flowing at the baggage claim. I am a well seasoned traveler for both business and pleasure. This was my first experience with this airline and it will certainly be my last. I would never fly this airline again!",1frontier-airlines,28/10/14,Unpleasant staff; unwilling to assist in any way expensive baggage fees including carry-on old planes with broken seats extra charge for a soft drink and the list goes on. The price of the ticket was not any cheaper than any other airline but the service and lack of customer care made it a very negative experience across the board. Especially for a handicap passenger or anyone with special needs it is a bad choice to fly Frontier!,1frontier-airlines,28/10/14,My wife and I flew from Denver to Minneapolis. They changed our seats at the last minute by calling us up to the counter. We argued to no avail. Rude agent says they don't have to explain. We were reassigned seats to the back of the plane and separated. I will never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,22/10/14,Due to storms our flight was over 30 minutes late leaving Atlanta. Knowing that we only had 35 minutes to make our connection I expressed my concern to two of the flight attendants on the plane before take-off. They assured me that due to flights being late that it shouldn't be a problem making our connection since the tower was aware. We arrived 15 minutes after our connecting flight left. We were offered stand-by on the last flight to Phoenix along with 10 other passengers. We were told that there were no seats available the next day and would have to fly stand-by on any of the flights to Phoenix on Tuesday. We were confirmed for a flight on Wednesday. This was unacceptable since we had to return to work on Wednesday. When I asked if we would be provided with food and hotel vouchers I was informed that it wasn't Frontier's fault and that we would not be given any form of compensation. Taking matters into our own hands we chose to fly into Las Vegas and rented a car to make the 5.5 hour drive home. I was told that flights cannot be held yet as I sat waiting for the stand-by flight I witnessed Flt 583 to Salt Lake City at 7.05pm being held for a flight that had arrived late at the gate next to it. I have been flying for 40 years. I have seen a drastic decline in the quality of air travel over the years. To go from getting a hot meal on the plane to having to pay for a can of soda. The lack of compassion from Frontier's customer service center is disturbing to say the least. I wasn't even offered a discount voucher for a hotel as I was told I should have been. It's a shame that the customers who pay for a service are treated with disrespect.,frontier-airlines,22/10/14,My daughter has flown Frontier Airlines from Seattle to Denver to Bismarck and back on several occasions so I should have known better. Her flights were almost always late and there were several times they were late enough for her to miss her connections to Seattle or to Bismarck. Still the cheaper fare wooed me. Well after leaving 45 minutes late on my flight to Denver and 3 hours late from Denver I am no longer interested in the savings. Goodbye Frontier.,1frontier-airlines,12/10/14,Like some of the folks here I questioned my sanity for booking Frontier after reading the reviews! But it was the only non-stop to Denver from Reagan National. I was pleasantly surprised OK so my standards are not that high but was more then comparable to US Airways I normally fly to Florida. As another reviewer said read the rules. There was a woman on the Denver to DC was arguing about the size of her carry-on at least this airline sticks to their guns about the size allowed.,6frontier-airlines,08/10/14,My family and I recently traveled using Frontier Airlines. I must say the ticketing counter staff Frontier has are the most incompetent representatives I have ever seen. We arrived at the desk approximately 90 minutes prior to flight. We had our tickets and baggage all previously taken care of online. We stood inline for 45 minutes waiting to just get our baggage checked and placed on the conveyor belt while the only representative spent this entire time with one customer ahead of us. When we finally got to the desk we were informed it was too late to send our bags to the plane. After attempting to explain we have been waiting the representative charged an additional $225. then put us on a flight 12 hours later which created a domino affect with our rental car and hotel being cancelled for a no-show. I am disappointed with our service and trip therefore I warn others to look elsewhere for air travel.,frontier-airlines,05/10/14,Flying from Ft. Lauderdale to Cleveland on 9/28/14. Flight was supposed to leave at 8:00 PM. At the airport flight posted a delay to 11:30 PM. Good weather. Flight then posted to 10.30. Got something to eat just outside terminal. At 9:30 went to gate. Fight cancelled with no announcement and nobody at the gate. Found all the passengers at the check in. Only two employees and one line. No alternative fights until Wednesday. Missed my appointments and had to forfeit the return fight on another airline. Buyer Beware. Read all the bad reviews.,frontier-airlines,05/10/14,Charlotte NC (CLT) to Washington Dulles DC (IAD). Sep 19 2014 - Sep 21 2014. Beware: Extra fees. You will have to pay for you carry on going to the city you are traveling to and on the way back $25-35. Staff are extremely unprofessional and I do not recommend this airline to anyone.,1frontier-airlines,05/10/14,"We flew Frontier from Tampa to Denver and back again on 9-17 to 9-26. I had read reviews thought I was insane while booking and decided to get familiar with the rules and regulations posted on their website. We used the check in baggage after signing up with early rewards and it cost us $15.00 each way per checked in luggage. Had no problem toting a decent sized bag on board as our ""personal"" item. Seating was $3.00 each way - still not a lot to pay to have a seat on board together. Thought the flight crew was rather bland on the flight to Denver our return trip was the complete opposite. I totally enjoyed all the jokes both by the pilot as well as the rest of the crew! Very relaxing flight. That being said I would definitely without a doubt let Frontier take me where I need to go in the future.",10frontier-airlines,28/09/14,Surprised by all the fees. Their ticket price is deceptive as Frontier charges for carry on and seat assignments and provides nothing in the cabin for economy. Website charged x2 for a single carry on. Dropped the second passenger for return trip. Could not get boarding pass online or at the airport check in device. Had to wait for the staff to show up. Absolutely no chance of getting through to a person at the 800 number tried x3 minimum wait was 34 minutes (they said). Minimum leg room. Passenger in front could not recline seat all the way without breaking my legs which she tried several times. The single plus of the experience was the cabin crew. They were fine both ways. But flying is too much of a hassle to put up with the likes of Frontier's bait and switch and poor communications. We actually paid more once all the extra fees were added in. Will be willing to pay a lot more to avoid Frontier in the future. Plus the aircraft we flew in were extremely old Airbus 320s. The 320 went into service 26 years ago.,frontier-airlines,28/09/14,I arrived with my family to fly to Atlanta GA. We arrived with more than enough time to check our baggage and make the scheduled flight. There were two representatives when we arrived one representative just closed his site and walked away leaving only one person to service the remaining passengers. The lady left alone was very slow helping one customer which lead to the remaining passengers being left without enough time to process their baggage. When we got to the desk she informed us that it was too late and she would have to reschedule our flight. We tried to explain that we have been waiting in line for at least 20 minutes and there was more than enough time if they were properly staffed. She just apologized and rescheduled our flight for an all night red eye flight that will leave us short on time if not late for the graduation we planned to attend. She also charged us $75 each totalling $225. This was my first attempt to use Frontier Airlines as of now I will never use this airline again. I now see why they are rated number two in airlines with the most complaints.,2frontier-airlines,22/09/14,"There will be additional fees. You will have to pay for your baggage (both checked and carry-on). Your seat will not be guaranteed unless you pay a minimum of $8 to select your seat. Frontier has a strategy of overbooking presumably to ensure full flights. Every day groups of these extra passengers are forced into later flights. ""Check-in is 45 minutes prior to departure"" means that you will be charged $75 and forced into the next flight if you do not check-in 45 minutes prior to departure. Frontier is the only airline that pulls their employees from the check-in counter and shuts down their check-in computers 45 minutes before departure to ensure that you will not be allowed in if you arrive late. I was running late to my flight this morning and called Frontier's 1-800 number at the suggestion of the friendly JetBlue check-in folks as Frontier's counter had recently been abandoned. I manoeuvred my way through the expected automated system and finally reached a woman who handled my situation with the patience and understanding of a grizzly woken from hibernation. I was interrupted and rudely instructed to be quiet and listen to the rules before rebooking my flight. By the way this airline treats its passengers I should not have expected their employees to be any happier. Frontier employs bait-and-switch policies to maintain the ""cheap ticket"" reputation. In reality Frontier's customers are not presented with an honest estimate of the cost of their travel at checkout. My conclusion is that the service one receives from other airlines is well worth the additional 20% in initial ticket costs. You will end up paying that much more to Frontier anyway.",1frontier-airlines,19/09/14,I have flown Frontier many times over the past several years. My last flight with the company will be my last! I flew economy class knowing that I would have to pay extra for checked and carry on luggage. Prior to my trip I used Frontier's website to determine the acceptable dimensions of a carry on bag. I then measured the bag I intended to take. It was within the guidelines provided on the website. I paid to check one bag and proceeded to the gate to board the flight. Just prior to boarding the gate attendant required me to place my carry on bag in a little box to ensure that it was of proper size. It did not fit by less than a 1/4 of an inch in the length. They immediately charged me $50.00 for the carry on. I have flown with this same carry on bag for many years it has even taken several trips on Frontier and fits perfectly under the seat. Needless to say because of this experience I will pay a little extra to fly on Southwest and/or United at least then I will know exactly what its going to cost me before I leave the house!,frontier-airlines,19/09/14,"I recently flew from Dulles to Atlanta and back and for the most part it was a pleasant experience. I have flown AirTran more often than another airline and Frontier is comparable. I bought my tickets directly from Frontier about 4 months in advance. I paid $20 for a carry on $15 for an exit-row seat and $3 to choose my seat at time of purchase (twice coming and going) and my total round-trip fare with fees was $198 so if I had not paid the extra fees it would have been $122. In reading the reviews here I see that many people buy their tickets from third party sites (Orbitz etc.) and are surprised by the ""hidden fees"" when they reach the gate. I really think that they have only themselves to blame. First every time you fly you should check the airline's website for their policies; the fees are very clear on Frontier's site. I think even the third-party sites tell you to check the airline's site. I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for people who make assumptions and then become indignant when their assumptions don't match reality. I also read below that the flight attendants wouldn't help lift luggage because of ""policy."" On both my flights the staff were very helpful with luggage so clearly it's either not a policy or one that not all attendants heed. The only minor complaint I have about Frontier was that both flights were late to take off by about 20-30 min. There seemed to be no particular reason for the delay. I didn't have a connecting flight so I didn't care but it might be useful info.",9frontier-airlines,19/09/14,Never mind extra fee's! How about no show flights! Recently stranded in Milwaukee flight 996 - Milwaukee to Trenton. Arrived 4 hours early for the flight and saw on status board that the flight was cancelled. Went to ticket counter and no one was there when staff showed up for work I addressed them with the problem and was told a matter of factly that the flight was cancelled. I was treated like a fool and no one - not one Frontier rep cared that we didn't have a ride home. I had to rent a car and drive to Trenton from Milwaukee. Do not fly with this airline they will strand you and leave you to fend for yourself.,frontier-airlines,14/09/14,"Frontier used to be a solid budget airline and living in Denver I was comfortable using them. I must admit that the last month I've told many how my wife was recently treated. To start they are getting very skimpy on extras so she found out that her bag check would cost $35 when she got to the airport. This all but kills the advantage they have over United for 'cost' though if she had known earlier she would have bag checked to save money. More important though was the way that first the agent at the gate treated her about how she should have checked after she obviously didn't know about the fee. It was more of a ""it's your fault"" thing. Then she explained that she is recovering from shoulder surgery to the agent who told her to discuss this with a flight attendant and they will ""Assist"". Unfortunately when she boarded the less than helpful person said ""Well you should have bag checked if you have an issue lifting your bag and then told her per policy she couldn't help"" My wife is very kind when speaking and pretty tough but the really rough attitudes had her crying. I'm sorry but I fly a lot and will do anything in my power to never fly them again and I live where the hub is.",frontier-airlines,14/09/14,I took time to read the reviews of previous passengers of Frontier Airlines and if I had relied solely on what I had read I would not have bought tickets. I disregarded the reviews read all the requirements for baggage fees and seating costs and bought tickets for my daughter and I. Did round trip from Baltimore to Florida and back. It was a pleasant experience. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. Even after paying for luggage seats and hand luggage the total fare was less than most airlines if not all. I will definitely fly with them again.,8frontier-airlines,14/09/14,"We arrived 90 minutes prior to our flight and (despite discrepancies in their fee structure from what their website stated) we made it to our gate trouble free. Only then did we find out that our flight was delayed by 2 hours because the co-pilot didn't show up (come to find out they had known for hours but didn't update their system so we woke up at 2.00am for nothing). They told us we would make our connecting flight despite the delay which was an impossibility given the schedule. Of course we missed our connecting flight and Frontier representatives were unhelpful and unapologetic. No one can tell us where our luggage is or when we will get home. Other carriers have open seats going to our destination but Frontier refuses to buy us a ticket. The next seat they can ""promise us"" will be 24+ hours after we arrived here!",frontier-airlines,09/09/14,Another Frontier flight where the TV's don't work. On the way out from Denver today no TV and on the way back from Los Angeles tonight the same problem. Planes are as dirty as I have ever seen them. What happened to my favorite short run airline. I'm a Summit member who can't believe how quickly things have gone bad. Date of flight 9/6/14.,3frontier-airlines,06/09/14,We will not fly Frontier again. My husband and I bought our tickets through cheaptickets.com and picked Frontier because it had a non-stop flight to our destination and because they had the cheapest fare by about $20 a ticket. We were only going to be gone a short time so we both packed a carry-on so we could avoid paying to check a bag. When we checked in for our flight we found out that we would have to pay $35 for each carry-on! We thought Frontier was ridiculous to charge so much (if at all) for carry-ons when no other airline we've flown with charge for that. Also Frontier charges almost $2.00 for a can of soda or juice. You only get one free cup of water after that the price goes up to the same as for a soda. Frontier lures it's customers into buying airfare by offering tickets that seem to be the lowest priced but then rob you with all the hidden fees. Frontier also has its flight attendants pitch a credit card offer to the passengers during the flight. I know that it is their job to do so but I found it extremely annoying. Although the flight attendants were friendly it does not make up for the feeling of being robbed. I will give Frontier a point for the flight attendants being friendly and a point for it being a non-stop flight.,2frontier-airlines,06/09/14,My husband and I arrived 55 minutes prior our 10.13 flight from Seattle to Denver on Labor Day. When we arrived to the ticket counter we saw a small sign that stated that a Frontier representative would not arrive until 11am and to use the nearby kiosks. We attempted to use the kiosks but the system stated that due to our late arrival we would need to speak with a Frontier representative. Since there was no representative at the ticket counter we had no way to check in for boarding. When we call customer service they let us know that there was no way we would make our flight but Frontier would graciously charged an additional $150 to place us on another flight. We then were charged $50 for our 1 carry on bag.,frontier-airlines,01/09/14,"My daughter needed a ticket from Dallas TX to Minot ND. There are only 4 airlines that go to Minot. When we started looking at prices Frontier offered the one-way flight for a total of $174 which included a lay-over in Denver CO. Regarding the ""nickel and dime"" tactics - I actually appreciate them! It provides the option of taking the services for an additional cost or leaving them and saving some cash. The day before the flight we checked in online. During this check-in process I added a checked bag for $15. The option was there to select a seat for $3-$25 but we opted out of the choosing. We printed the receipt for the bag the boarding passes and a receipt. The flight was scheduled to deport at 2.15pm so we arrived at DFW at 11.30 to make sure we had time should any issue arise. When we walked up to the ticket counters a Frontier service agent was standing by the kiosks to provide assistance. Since I had printed my boarding passes she directed me to a counter clerk who was checking bags of passengers who did not need to check-in at the counter. The checked bag weighed 50.5 lbs. They checked the bag. I asked about my daughters purse/bag to make sure we would not have a problem with it being too large to count as the free personal bag. She assured me it was fine. Both agents were friendly. This entire process so far had taken 5 minutes. The plane arrived to the gate boarded and took off on time from DFW to Denver. I asked my daughter about the seats and such and she said it was the same as most other flights she has been one. She did take her iPad with movies on it and watched that during the flight. Landed in Denver on time. The Denver to Minot flight arrived boarded and departed on time. She had a smooth flight the flight was relatively uneventful and arrived in Minot 5 minutes early. After getting off of the plane it took her about 20 minutes to get her luggage and she was on her way out of the airport! Overall a budget airline with great prices.",10frontier-airlines,01/09/14,"We flew Frontier for the first and last time this weekend. We purchased our tickets online with the assumption we could carry on our bags for the weekend. We were charged $60 each way. This was not disclosed when we purchased our tickets through Expedia. We were not able to sit together as the selection online required more payment to select our seats to ""upgrade"" in which we were not even upgrading we just wanted to choose our seats. They now even charge for a pop. We fly 1-3 times per year. Just charge what you want up front (offer discounts for those who have no luggage which would probably be one in thousands) so people know what the total bill will be. It is very deceitful and unfair practice to get more money when it's advertised as the lowest fare etc.",1frontier-airlines,28/08/14,"Frontier seems to be doing their very best to consistently frustrate and anger the people who fly with them. My first experience I was stuck in Denver for 18 hours due to cancellations and delayed flights. Then when I requested another flight staff did absolutely nothing to help me switch my flight book a different flight or even refund my original ticket. They had me on the next available flight at 9.30 am the next morning (which would have been a 29 hour layover). I ended up just booking another ticket with another airline to fly to out. I understand weather causes delays but at least work with the travelers to accommodate them on different flights/airlines or give them hotel/food vouchers to help. It was ridiculous. The next experience (and hopefully the last) I had to fly on a different date than the date on my ticket. They tried to charge $450 dollars to change the date by two days even though I had just purchased the ticket a few hours earlier that day. They refused to refund the ticket (it would be issued as ""credit"" for a different ticket) and wanted to charge me an additional $75 dollars to cancel the ticket. The airline employers are extremely rude. The line was long the travelers were getting frustrated while the only two workers did everything in their power to take as long as they possibly could. They denied military checked bags (even though I had travel orders) because I had 3 of them and the girl was too lazy to tag them. I demanded to speak to a supervisor and was able to get them all checked for free. Will do everything in my power to not fly with this airline again. Even if I have to pay 50 bucks more for United it still comes out even since I don't have to pay $35 to bring a carryon.",1frontier-airlines,26/08/14,Worst airline experience. The employees are rude and snotty they airline charges you for everything. $15 to pick your seats for a family of 4 that's $60 $30 for a carry on $25 for each 1st checked bag $4 for water no free refreshments here. I can't understand how they stay in business. If you want a roomier seat that's $30. On take off there were unsecure bins in the galley so when the plane pitched up there was a loud crash. We flew this airline because it was the one Priceline recommended for our trip. They took an hour to get everyone's checked luggage to baggage claim. Save yourself the headache pay a little more and fly a real airline carrier.,frontier-airlines,20/08/14,"Flight 754 on 8/17/2014 from Sky Harbor to DIA. They have all these rules about when we are to check in etc but when we get there to check in where are they? The Sky Harbor ticket counter was horrible. Not only did we have to wait on them for 15+ minutes when they did show up they sauntered like they had all day. No comments to anyone about our wait. We happened to be first and actually got our bags tagged after the sixth person in line behind us. The gal ""helping"" us was rude and I swear moving as slow as she could. Maybe I should not have said anything about being there first! I have over 200k frequent flyer miles-Southwest here I come!",frontier-airlines,20/08/14,I have been flying Frontier Airlines for years. Not anymore. Both flights had broken down planes. My flight out of Milwaukee had a flat tyre. There was only 1 maintenance person on duty. They had to call another in to help fix the tyre. Our flight to Denver was delayed 2.5 hours. Of course our connecting flight was gone once we landed in Denver and there were no other flights available. Frontier shuttled everyone to a hotel for the night. On the way back home my flight from Denver to Milwaukee also had a broken plane. Flight delayed by 2 hours because we had to wait for a plane from Los Angeles. I have flown almost every US airline and this is the worst.,1frontier-airlines,18/08/14,What you get on Frontier Airlines is one glass of water free. Everything else costs something and all those something's are so under par that the whole Frontier Experience becomes a terrible experience and a costly one. You really don't get a carry on unless it's as big as an old computer case. Customer service will split up families and try to seat two year olds from their mother and they don't follow through with handicap assistance. I found the whole Frontier Experience not one to do again. I advise you to get a credit card with baggage allowances and fly those airlines. They are better and cheaper. I forgot about my credit cards but I won't forget again.,1frontier-airlines,18/08/14,Thunderstorms in Denver are common and although they cause delays the delays are typically limited to 45-60 mins. We flew from Milwaukee to Denver to Santa Ana and back the same way. Our flights were all on time and even arrived a little early each destination. All of the staff were very friendly from the people at the check-in counter the flight crew and even pilots. The check-in counter people were very accommodating to our family with two small children. My husband is a veteran and with his military ID they gave us free checked bags and also even upgraded one of our flights to stretch seating! This was a very appreciated surprise! This was definitely an excellent experience flying with Frontier.,10frontier-airlines,18/08/14,"Was set to fly out on a Friday to Denver then Bozeman from Atlanta. ATL airport had a fire in a tram which shut down passenger travel between concourses. Long story short we were stranded in a tunnel. I wasn't worried as I told my wife and kids that the airport is shut down so our flight will be delayed. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that the monitor had every flight delayed but the Frontier flight it took off without us and several other people. I still thought ""It's ok they will get us out to Denver to catch our connecting somehow."" I was incredibly let down as the airline did nothing to help us just put us on a flight 3 days later. They didn't offer any apologies made no efforts to fix the problem. To make it worse they redirected our bags from Bozeman back to Atlanta on a Saturday. Of course the bags did not make it to ATL. Another 2 and half hour conversation with Frontier - more rudeness. I got a security guard in Bozeman to get a luggage woman to finally locate our bags and hold them for us. It took me 15 minutes what Frontier couldn't do in 2 days.",frontier-airlines,18/08/14,Trying to get home to Orange County CA from Orlando. Flight was scheduled for Monday but I tried to grab an earlier flight. Frontier had zero flights leaving until Monday. On Monday as I arrived at the airport I was notified the flight had been changed to 5.48 am the following day. I was given a hotel voucher. A few hours later I happened to be walking past ticketing and noticed my flight to Denver was now showing 11.48 pm same day (in a few hours). I asked if the flight at 5.48 am tomorrow was still on schedule. She said no that now tonight's 11.48pm flight. No one called or emailed me letting me know about the change. I asked if I could fly the 7.45 am flight next day instead of this 11.48 pm flight. Was told no it's full. When asked if they could try to change my connecting flight time in Denver from 2 pm to something a little earlier they said they didn't know how to do that. I was traveling with a 9 year old and they didn't put us together. I look forward to my 12 hour lay over in Denver now. Will never fly this awful airline again.,frontier-airlines,18/08/14,Excellent service. I flew to Nashville from Montana round trip I have no complaints that's over 4 thousand miles with frontier. We had a delay in Denver but that will happen with all the top notch planes as well.,10frontier-airlines,18/08/14,I am a medical student in Omaha and took a quick trip out to Durango with friends. The airplane broke down before the scheduled departure the mechanic was not available I missed my connection in Denver and have been here for the last 24-27 hours. Apparently Frontier does not work with other airlines - or other airlines don't work with Frontier. The two men at the gate where I was on standby were less than courteous the ladies at the customer desk were nice but unhelpful. They have no way of checking to make sure that my luggage arrived in Omaha either. For a company that nickels and dimes its customers for seat assignments carry-ons etc. it sure isn't making itself seem worth the money. Just save yourself the headache and fly another airline.,1frontier-airlines,18/08/14,Flying from Phoenix to Denver. Frontier has all these rules about when passengers need to check in but it is ok to make us wait 15-20 minutes to check our bags. The staff come sauntering down to the ticket counter no apologies and no welcomes. My husband and I were the first ones there had checked in and reprinted our boarding passes and ready to go. Did a ticket agent ask who was there first. Of course not and then we ended up waiting while they dealt with six groups before we were taken care of. When I said we were there first I got the evil eye and then had to wait until the agent got to us and deal with her snarky attitude. I swear that cost us even more time. When I tried to call customer service the edit time is 35 minutes. Guess I am not the only one with issues. I have 200k miles in my frequent flyer program. Guess I will have to be desperate to us those. Southwest here I come.,frontier-airlines,14/08/14,Thunderstorms in Denver are common and although they cause delays the delays are typically limited to 45-60 mins. My flight from STL to DEN was delayed 2 hrs then 4 hrs I wasn't worried as my layover for my flight to SEA was 5 hrs. When we arrived in DEN we were informed that flight was delayed 6 hours (leaving at midnight as opposed to 6 pm. The plane arrived but the outgoing crew had left. They changed the flight until 1.45 am and finally cancelled the flight stranding all 150 passengers in the airport. No rooms offered no meals offered not even a toothbrush!,frontier-airlines,14/08/14,Flew from SLC to Denver then to Puerto Vallarta. First flew with small children all separated from parents when asked to change seats was told by a very rude stewardess that we had to stay in assigned seats. What person flying wants to sit next to someone else's crying two year old? Then the stewardess had the nerve to talk to other passengers about us very unprofessional. Pay the extra fly Delta.,frontier-airlines,11/08/14,"Flew in and out of Trenton from St. Augustine. A little nervous after reading review however our experience was great. I didn't go in with high expectations and was very pleased with the outcome. First we flew Classic Plus which allowed more leg room (my son is 6'3"" and needs extra space). This allowed us to check a bag each and have carry on for free (in addition to the allowed personal item). The seats were roomy and comfy. The staff at each airport was friendly (we arrived 1.5 hours before the flight with boarding passes printed at home as instructed). Had read horrible reviews of Trenton but found it very nice though small. Restrooms available at the gate a nice little eatery upstairs (before security). If you plan well and read the fine print you should have no complaints. It was 100 times better than my latest flight on United to Newark last month.",8frontier-airlines,11/08/14,Flight Cleveland Hopkins to Fort Lauderdale. Flight was delayed already when we got there because of domino effect of previous flights. It was delayed even more when previous delayed flight to Atlanta had a bad tyre which delayed theirs and our flight by one hour. Total delay time for our flight more than 2.5 hours. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews because they never read the small print. Use your common sense a $30 flight is not going to include baggage fees. Plane was airbus A320 featuring fin the tiger shark. Seats were very uncomfortable and needed new cushions. No IFE. Crew was friendly and we received free drinks for late time. I expected this from a cheap airline so that's why the review is not too negative.,5frontier-airlines,06/08/14,I've flown 8 times with Frontier airlines and I couldn't be happier with their service. The flights were laid back and quiet. Once I even lost my boarding pass after I went through the security checkpoint. The lady at the terminal was very nice understanding and knowledgeable. After verifying my identity with a few clicks at a computer she printed me out another pass and I was able to catch my flight without a problem. They've never lost any of my luggage either. The inflight crew were always very nice and quick to respond to questions and concerns. The only down-side I could find is that you can only buy in-flight refreshment with a credit card - no cash.,9frontier-airlines,06/08/14,Each time if you are in the front three rows the crew restrict usage of the overhead in preference to the people not already boarded. This usually means that we end up putting their bag further down the plane and the first three bins usually end up not full and people boarding further back of the plane end up using the bins. It is illogical and rude to the passengers already boarded. Now we have to wait to go down the plane to get our bags. It makes now sense. Frontier you have lost me with your ridiculous policy.,1frontier-airlines,06/08/14,July 29 2014 was flying from Minneapolis to Idaho Falls one stop in Denver. Ladies at the ticket check in said the flight was overbooked due to weather and we would not make the connecting flight until Aug 3. After 2 hours of going back and forth talking to them about options which they were unwilling to help with we asked how many seats were available well we found out 6 or 7 so why could we not go on our assigned flight? We arrived in Denver the flight to Idaho Falls was delayed and yes there were seats available their too. So why did the ticket ladies not just let us check-in in the first place?? It would have saved us 2 hours of stress. I'll never fly with them again!,frontier-airlines,03/08/14,Plane departed and returned to the gate three times while in Atlanta due to a warning light. On the fourth try the plane took off - now 5 hours late. Connections were missed in Denver by nearly everyone on the plane resulting in a mass of unhappy yelling customers. Options presented by Frontier were to wait for the next flight - in 48 hours - or get booked on a different airline with additional legs and a long layover. Frontier offered a hotel voucher for what ended up being a 3 hour stay and meal vouchers which were not usable at 1 am. Through this I had a toddler with me who became exhausted and dehydrated. Never again will I consider Frontier.,2frontier-airlines,03/08/14,I had no problems with my flights (PDX-CVG via Denver) either with Frontier's service personnel or my expectations. It strikes me that most of the people posting really bad reviews didn't read the information Frontier provides when purchasing a ticket. Frontier is exactly what it says it is basically an al a carte airline. My flights were on time the staff was professional and courteous. Check in online and print your boarding passes at home and you'll have no problems at the gate.,10frontier-airlines,03/08/14,I've flown Frontier numerous times and never had a problem except once my luggage was on a later flight. Minor inconvenience and it was returned to me at 2am the next morning. It happens with any airline. The staff have always been friendly and attentive. I guess there's always a first time but I still plan to fly with Frontier.,10frontier-airlines,03/08/14,My sisters and I went to Minneapolis. We left Idaho Falls flight 446 and 120 on July 25 2014. Flights went smoothly and staff were nice. July 29 2014 on our return flights 115 and 447. We arrived at the Frontier counter to check in and were told a tornado hit Denver and all seats were taken and no seats available until Aug 3 2014 so we could get a refund that night. In a panic we checked other airlines to Idaho Falls we could get another flight the next morning Delta or United. We asked the Frontier counter to help us book a flight they said they could not help us either a refund or travel Aug 3. We were about to ask for our refund when my brother in law suggested we try again to get to Denver options were better there to get to Idaho Falls and cheaper. The ladies at the counter said they could not help us we asked if their were seats available on flight 115 finally they said yes there were seats available but we would miss the flight to Idaho Falls. We told them we would take our chances since the flight going to Denver was delayed 1 hour maybe the flight to Idaho Falls would also be delayed they would not assign us seats to Idaho Falls just to Denver only check our baggage to Denver which we opted to carry on. We barely arrived at the gate for flight 115 after 2 hours of fighting with staff at the check in counter as they were boarding. Staff on the flight were very nice and apologetic. Flight 447 was delayed due to weather as we expected and had to wait for seating assignments just as they were boarding. Boarded the plane and again their were a few empty seats. Arrived in Idaho Falls only 30 minutes later than the scheduled arrival time! Had we not insisted that staff get us on flight 115 we would still be in Minnesota.,frontier-airlines,31/07/14,I arrive with more than 40 minutes to spare for my flight from Trenton to Raleigh. Due to a website issue I was unable to print out a proper boarding pass. Upon arrival the kiosk would not allow me to print my pass as it was under the 45 minute deadline a deadline that I have never encountered in all my years of flying. The Frontier reps at the counter were of no help and were quite hostile to my (and the 7 other passengers) complaints. They are essentially running a racket. Trenton airport is small and the time to the gate from the ticket counter would have been 5 minutes or less. Yet Frontier asks (though I have yet to see this information anywhere other than the Trenton ticket counter) you arrive a full 2 hours before a flight to get a boarding pass. My flight was at 6.25 this morning. It was an absurd experience and easily the worst I have ever encountered flying.,frontier-airlines,29/07/14,I can only speak to our experience on Frontier and it was good. Flew from Cincinnati to Punta Cana DR on a chartered vacation flight in July 2014. Non -stop. 1 free checked back carry on and soda. Food was extra. Both round trip flights started boarding early left on time and arrived a few minutes early. I would fly Frontier again if the price was right and departure times made sense.,9frontier-airlines,22/07/14,I was on a flight with Frontier that was delayed 7 hours. There was no contact from the airline to me (phone text or email) alerting me of the delay. When I arrived to the airport I was informed that I could not check my bag but still had to pay the $25 checked bag fee. I then had to dump all of my liquids from my bag so it could go through security. We were then delayed another 90 minutes while sitting on the plane at the gate at which point flight attendants informed us we could pay for beverages snacks or TV if we would like. The pilots were the only friendly and apologetic staff associated with Frontier. I would not recommend Frontier to anyone. The flights may be cheap but you pay for your seat bags and everything else later. Additionally if you do have a complaint you cannot get anyone to assist you.,1frontier-airlines,22/07/14,"I fly Frontier only when I have to that is when there are virtually no other choices. I don't mind some product differentiation in which they charge extra for ""extras"" but it is completely ridiculous that they intentionally won't allow people traveling together to sit together without paying an extra fee. Also charging for carry-on bags is very annoying but I can live with it. The Frontier company attitude appears to be one of ""screw the customer"" and as one who works with customers all the time this attitude really bothers me.",2frontier-airlines,22/07/14,I flew yesterday from Trenton to Ft. Lauderdale. Was very excited to be flying from Trenton - much more convenient than going to Newark or Philadelphia. Check in was fine - security easy and waiting area adequate. The problem came when the flight was delayed for 9 hours - yes 9 hours. I spent the entire day and evening at the airport. the problem is two-fold - why I am not likely to fly Frontier again: 1) The communication throughout the ordeal was worse than awful - it is pretty clear that they knew early on that this was going to be a horrific wait. They kept stringing us along - many of us could have gone home for the day but instead we were there not knowing what was going on. 2) Second issue - staff are incredibly rude. Staff upstairs at check in were great but those in the gate area - with the exception of the manager were rude unhelpful and without basic knowledge needed to be interacting with passengers. 9 hours late and poor customer service are problems that need to be addressed.,frontier-airlines,22/07/14,"I took this flight this AM 7/19 with my family Atlanta to Denver. Departure 8.47 on time. Good. Flight was safe landing was nice. All good. Cannot complain. The main reasons I log this review is because if you are flying on a budget (which you likely are on Frontier) then beware of the surly attendants the lack of snacks coffee and beverages available on a 3 + hr flight. This was a 8.47am flight no coffee no individual snacks for purchase one box snack available for purchase and some sodas/juices. I don't look forward to airline ""snacks"" but when you fly with kids creature comforts are welcome at times. Very strange airline. Very strange flight. Not worth the $1400.",1frontier-airlines,22/07/14,We flew Frontier from Trenton to Tampa because the flight appeared to be the least expensive and because of the convenience of Trenton Airport. It was a mistake that we will never make again! No free luggage at all - the first piece checked in costs $25. If you have a carry it costs even more - $35. When we factor in $8 a day for parking at Trenton Airport we ended paying more than what we would have flying other airlines. The flight was delayed both ways. The fight from Trenton was over an hour late and it was just seem as par for the course. No apologies whatsoever. We're waiting for the flight from Tampa and it is delayed as well. The service is awful - you'll get a cup of water for free. That's it. It is just not worth it.,1frontier-airlines,20/07/14,July 11 2014 I travelled to Portland Oregon from Des Moines Iowa via Denver on Frontier Airlines flights 155 and 799. The ground personnel at the Des Moines and Denver Airports were extremely helpful and personable. The air personnel (both flight attendants and flight crew) were courteous and attentive. As for the newly revised baggage policies of Frontier I understand and accept them. Frontier Airlines is no different than legacy airlines. They are here to provide good and comfortable air service to their passengers. But they are also here to make a profit. Again hats off to Frontier for providing courteous friendly and helpful service.,10frontier-airlines,20/07/14,Flight 527 Cleveland to Denver and 745 Denver to Phoenix. Return flight 1112 Phoenix to Cleveland. July 7- 15. My family of 7 just flew to Pheonix from Cleveland and back and I have to say I was very pleased in fact impressed with how smooth things went. I had read several reviews about Frontier and I have to abmit I was nervous about flying with them. We have flown on several airlines and I must say I will be flying Frontier in the future the associates were very helpful and the aircraft were very clean.,9frontier-airlines,20/07/14,I had checked in online and printed boarding passes and coupons for my luggage. I arrived at the Madison WI airport 40 minutes prior to my flight. Madison is a small airport and usually does not take much time to check luggage and get to the gate. The Frontier desk was closed. There was a sign on the counter stating someone would return after the flight left. We did not make our flight to Seattle. I think it would be most helpful if Frontier stated on their website that the gates close 45 minutes prior to take off and that you will not be able to board your plane. I paid $75 to get a flight out a day later. I asked if I could travel to a nearby airport and take their flight later in the day to Seattle and I was told this was not an option unless I wanted to pay full fare $600. They were unwilling to put us on another airline going out today. I also paid to select my seats so I could travel with my daughter. I am sorry I did not read any of these reviews prior to my trip to avoid such a disaster. I will avoid Frontier at all costs in the future and can only hope my trip tomorrow goes without problems.,frontier-airlines,15/07/14,My family and I also had a horrible experience with Frontier and will never fly them again. We had no idea that we would have to pay $35 for carry-ons and $25 for checked baggage. We would have packed differently if we had known this. Each of my children had a small rolling suitcase which we ended up checking and it cost us $250 total extra for the trip. I feel like they robbed us! This extra charge is not common practice among any other airlines I have flown before. Then we get on the plane to discover that all drinks and snacks cost as well. They didn't even offer water on two of the flights. There is very little leg room so you feel like you're packed in like cattle. The whole trip gave us a terrible feeling about Frontier.,frontier-airlines,12/07/14,I am so frustrated with Frontier's new policies to charge you extra for everything: seat assignment carry-on bag checked bag coffee on the flight etc. I'm sure they will be charging for seat belts soon. Frontier used to be my favorite airline but now I avoid them at all costs. I am happy to pay a little extra (or not in many cases) to fly Southwest Airlines where they still let you check a bag for free and carry on a bag with your personal item. If Southwest isn't available I look for anything other than Frontier now. We are spreading the word and on my recent flight from Cincinnati I heard several passengers complaining saying they wouldn't fly Frontier anymore - it's so ridiculous. And because passengers have become so frustrated this has caused Frontier employees to lose their patience... what was once one of the friendliest airlines is now the rudest. Shame on you Frontier - this is the worst example of customer service I have seen in many years.,frontier-airlines,12/07/14,I arrived at the Sioux City airport an hour before my flight. It's a very small airport with just a few flights and a few gates going at one time. 30 minutes prior to my flight the man at the ticket counter announced they were closing the check-in desk and no one else would be able to print boarding passes or check luggage. I had checked-in previously from home and just needed a boarding pass printed. Frontier did not have a single self- service kiosk at the airport so I wouldn't have to wait in line with people who needed to check baggage. Myself and about 12 other people had been in line for 30 minutes but were turned away from our flight because they closed the desk. The next option they presented was rebooking in Omaha which is a 90 minute drive without offering a complimentary rebooking or even a discounted ticket. Frontier claimed it's their policy that guests arrive 2 hours prior to their flight (but neglected to mention their counter closes 30 minutes prior) so their desk closure was our problem - not theirs. It's pretty appalling that they were able to turn people away like that when there was adequate time to get everyone checked in and boarded if they hadn't closed the counter. The entire situation was unfortunate and handled poorly by the airline and by their employees. I will avoid flying Frontier going forward.,frontier-airlines,08/07/14,Flying to Denver from Seattle and back Frontier failed to get me on either flight. In Seattle the check-in desk was empty at 6pm Saturday with a sign that it would reopen 10 hours later at 4am. The automated machines were not giving boarding passes and I along with other passengers were stranded unable to reach our flight. On the return trip in Denver recent changes in timing cost me my flight. At the start the desk representative wasn't aware that my boarding pass could be printed for me after I'd checked in online. Unlike all other airlines the doors are closed early and baggage handling is closed early in Denver so I forfeited my pre-paid $20 baggage fee to try and make it to the airport. Luckily for me my bag was small enough to be carried on. Arriving at the gate I was told the doors had already closed and myself (plus some others who arrived after me) were told to go to customer service. It seems a policy change at Denver has Frontier closing their doors earlier than any other airline meaning I had no realistic time to reach the gate. Arriving at the customer service desk after being turned away from my plane I was told they would charge me $75 to be put on standby for a full flight 3 hours later. The staff were unsmiling unsympathetic and unapologetic. I'm now sitting through my first wait at the airport on standby for the next flight. I'm told my odds are not good and I'll probably be spending all day waiting for a flight home. I will not fly Frontier again.,1frontier-airlines,06/07/14,"TTN (Trenton-Mercer airport) NJ - CLE (Cleveland-Hopkins) OH. The customer service couldn't have been nicer. They were very nice on the plane. Sure they charge you for a carry on bag and beverage but what do you expect for an incredibly cheap fare. For the most part they were on time it was a bit delayed in Trenton because of minor issues going forward. This is essentially the ""T-Mobile"" of airlines. You pay for what you want how do you expect they make those fares so low. Great Airline gets you where you want to go recommend to anybody who is on a budget.",10frontier-airlines,06/07/14,Pretty good for a low-cost airline. I know they recently changed their policy on carry-on luggage where I believe you have to pay to have a carry-on bag using storage above. My last trip with them was in January of 2014. They were on time friendly bathrooms were clean and the flight was comfortable. In September of 2013 I flew from KC to PDX with a stop in Denver. On the way back to KC we did miss our connecting flight by about 5 minutes. They hadn't taken off yet but they wouldn't let us on because they were to leave the dock in just a few minutes. While it was a bit annoying they got us on the next flight to KC which left about 90 minutes later and I understand why they couldn't let us on that original connecting flight. Of course we didn't have to pay anything extra for the next connecting flight. With the changes in carry-on costs I'm not sure I will fly with them again because it all really depends on where I can get the best deal but if they are still the cheapest I have no qualms with flying Frontier again.,8frontier-airlines,06/07/14,Denver to SFO July 2nd. This is an inferior airline due to its policies and poor customer service. It is a myth that it costs less when you are done with their nickle and diming. The flight crews are fine it is everything leading up to it. The extra charges are over the top. The only thing that does not cost is a glass of water and using the toilet but I would not be surprised if this will change. I witnessed a young woman traveling with a baby who had paid for a checked bag. When she decided should needed to carry it on she offered to pay the difference and was told there was no way to refund and she would have to pay full carry-on fees or she could not board. Robbery by any other name. Any company that gouges the customer to stay in business needs to close its doors. Buyer beware.,1frontier-airlines,03/07/14,Check in was slow and unfriendly. My seat on the way to my destination was slouched to the right and the cushion was worn below the frame so I had two hours of metal frame for a seat. Costs for drinks are what they are but the crew could offer the complimentary cup of water or the charge for bottled. Also if you have to delay a flight 2.5 hours and not update the flight information on the boards I highly suggest you use the intercom when calling to finally board. I appreciate that I was nearly left behind after being told that You were being screamed at to close the doors yet could not properly inform passengers that the plane planning to leave. But here is my favorite part about Frontier Airlines I incurred a baggage fee for my personal carry on that was not large enough to have to stow above when I paid in advance online for only the bag I was checking to go under the plane. Lastly thank you for eliminating one more option when I decide to fly. I will never fly Frontier Airlines again and the other 3 people in my group agree!,frontier-airlines,03/07/14,"I would never fly Frontier Airlines again. Last week we have a 7am flight departing Denver on Friday morning. We arrived at the airport at 5.30am to check in for our flight we had to check bags so we figured we would just check in at the gate. We waited in line to check in for 45 minutes and when we got to the check in counter the lady stated that their system had locked (it was now 41 minutes before our flight) and we were not allowed to check in or attempt to catch our flight. Their policy is that you must be checked in 45 minutes before departure or you are out of luck we were 4 minutes late but had also been waiting in line for 45 minutes. The front desk lady was extremely rude and unhelpful and just continued saying ""well do you want to pay the $50 per person to change your flight to 5pm tonight"" we did not have any other option. The kicker was we took the 5pm flight and of course checked in 45 minutes before it took us under 15 minutes to get from the check in counter to the gate we could have caught our flight in the morning without any issues. Poor customer service terrible policy took no responsibility for the 45 minute check in line. Absolutely disgusted and will never travel with them again.",frontier-airlines,30/06/14,"Flight 369 from Newport News to Denver. My girlfriend and I checked in at our house and did not have access to a printer to print our passes leaving us with the only option of arriving early to have them printed by a Frontier representative. Confident that we were on time (over an hour early for boarding at this small airport) we stood in line behind a handful of people and two sometimes one representative. The line crept. Two or three people had been assisted in front of us and all the sudden the Frontier representatives walk away behind closed doors for over five minutes. Upon their return all of the paid in full checked in online customers were told in a rude manor that we were all not getting on the plane and to call a 1-800 number for further assistance. We were told it was our fault and there was no other option. The boarding gate could practically be seen from the check in counter there was still 50 minutes to board and all that was standing in our way was a piece of paper to let us through. The clock was ticking while we were about ready to give up. With only a few minutes to spare a woman showed up and took some names and returned with boarding passes. We boarded our flight with a foul taste in our mouths from the unprofessional attitude received from the Frontier representative at Newport News airport. Check- in was ""closed"" but we were all checked in and just needed a pass printed. Why was someone else able to help us? Airlines are a customer service industry and if you lack the most basic skills to satisfy those that support you there will most definitely be a problem for you in the future. A couple of boarding pass kiosks would have eliminated this whole headache.",1frontier-airlines,25/06/14,Frontier is not cheaper. I recently flew American Airlines to Seattle to get my two children and we flew Frontier back to TN. I had no problems at all with American to Seattle. No unexpected fees and charges or hassles at all. You should know that your buck doesn't stop with buying a ticket with Frontier. You must buy your seats and you must pay $50 per any carry on that goes in an overhead or checked at the gate. Even if it fits easily. They are out to squeeze every dime out of you in every way. You must pay for any beverage or snack on board. Not just cocktails and large snacks. They assured us at the gate in Seattle that we would see our baggage in Knoxville. We did not. They're lost and no one knows where they are. I've never written a review to express my dissatisfaction with an airline before but this airline has the worst customer service ever.,frontier-airlines,25/06/14,Spokane to Denver 18 June. Stormy weather in Denver prevented our flight from landing 3 times so we flew to Colorado Springs to refuel. We had to stay on the plane and only 1 of the 3 lavatories was operational - there was a line of about 30 people waiting to use it. An hour later I was close to the lav and had to sit down again for take-off. We got to Denver 2.5 hours late and my connecting flight to Little Rock had already left. After standing in a long line I found out their next flight to Little Rock wasn't for 2 days. They gave me a ticket to Branson Mo for the next day and I slept on the airport floor. In the morning I exchanged the Branson ticket for a Little Rock ticket for Friday since I didn't have transportation from Branson to Little Rock and got a hotel room for Thursday night. I left Denver Friday evening and got into Little Rock just before 11 pm. My luggage was not there. It had not been in Denver the 2 days I was there. The agent there couldn't get ahold of any of the other airports either. I called the baggage dept at Spokane and twice said they'd call back and haven't. I will not use this airline again.,2frontier-airlines,23/06/14,ILG-MDW 6/1/14 Flight 383. I disagree that the fares are higher once you add in the extras. Who do you think is paying for your extra luggage and soft drinks? You are! Everything is figured into the price and when compared to Southwest I know I saved quite a bit on my recent purchase. The service was timely and professional as well. I give Frontier credit for trying to carve a niche and I predict they will be quite successful as people get educated with regards to what they are doing. Also when fewer people are hauling on oversized luggage and trying to stuff it in the overheads it makes for a smoother and quicker loading and departure from the gate. Ultra low cost carriers like Frontier typically charge $5 extra to carry on a bag versus checking it which effectively eliminates the luggage hoarders trying to board planes with too much luggage which most would admit makes for a slow maddening boarding process. Also if you check/carry 100 lbs. of luggage on other carriers who offer free checked bags and carry-ons who do you think is paying for the extra fuel it takes to transport that? That's right it's you again! It's all built into the ticket price. Again I'd rather pay for what I want and for what I use. I was happy to pay a bit extra for leg room but not for everyone else's extra baggage. I'd rather bring my own bottled water than pay for all the soda and peanuts that everyone else drinks. I'm happy with the experience and will be trying this more often. On very short trips I can make due with a personal sized item and not even have to pay any luggage fees whatsoever! It's a win-win once we all better understand the concept.,10frontier-airlines,23/06/14,Seattle WA (SEA) - Denver CO (DEN). Economy Class A320. 13 June Flight #284. Denver CO (DEN) - St. Louis MO (STL) Economy Class Airbus A319 13 June Flight #138. I thought all airlines were about the same but Frontier takes cheap and greedy to a whole new level. I was amazed. 1st carry on bags were 35$ each. Nothing free on beverage cart except cups of water. Attendants just average but the service people at Denver and Seattle were downright rude! We arrived 2 hrs early at check in but no clerks w/long lines then plane arrived 1/2 hr late. When we boarded taxied to flight line then had to go back to gate because of equipment failure so we were an hr and a half late leaving Seattle but they did hold our connecting flight because it was late also. Don't fly w/ them!,frontier-airlines,20/06/14,I flew Frontier for the first and last time this past week. I had a business trip and this was the most cost effective airline for me. First my luggage is a rolling carry on that is the appropriate size and fits in any other airline. Frontier forces you to stick it in a sized up box at the counter to be approved to get the carry on onto the flight and that is for each connecting flight. It's difficult to fit in and I noticed a few people who were charged $50 per bag to have it checked because it did not fit. I lucked out but had to go through the ordeal all over again at my connecting flight in Denver and was told my bag would not fit when it did just a few hours earlier. On my 1st flight the passenger in front was in a broken seat and the stewardess continued to scold him to pull his seat forward for landing/takeoff when he repeatedly explained to her they finally comprehended to get a maintenance person on the flight who did not even fix the seat. I could go on and on but the points above are the biggest red flags and disappointments. Each flight was worse than the previous.,frontier-airlines,18/06/14,I never used Frontier before so I took a gamble for a weekend trip. My flight was scheduled to leave at 3.13pm. I was not told of any delay until I was at airport with bags in hand. Personnel were more concerned about the size of bags rather than telling us of a delay. We were delayed to the aircraft flying to Tampa first and coming back to Trenton. We finally got on board at 5.30 for a 5.50 departure and then were delayed as a passenger was injured trying to get onto plane. After that hour delay the captain stated that there was some issues with the plane's log so could not leave until that was fixed. Another hour passed and we finally pushed back from Gate at 8pm. We ended up sitting 15 minutes waiting for traffic to clear. We finally got in the air by 8.15pm. I have been flying for 25 years and never heard of a log book issue delaying a flight. Since we were so late had to rebook rental car and had other issues.,frontier-airlines,18/06/14,"DFW-DEN on 6/14/2014. Arrived at airport at 4.40am to find out that our 6.10am flight was cancelled due to not having a flight crew. There was no notification of such a cancellation even when we arrived at the airport the monitors still said 'On Time'. There were over 100 people in line at the ticketing counter and only 2 agents at the desk. Hold time on the phone was over 30 mins. Frontier could not get us out that day and we had to be rescheduled for the next day. When I discussed the no notification of cancelled flight one customer relations person told me they didn't know why I didn't receive a notification later another told me that Frontier no longer does flight updates. Arrived at airport at 4.35am on 6/15/14 for 6.10am flight and there were over 50 people in line to check bags and no one showed up to work the Frontier counter until 5.00am! Received several ""textbook"" answers from Customer Relations regarding the issues with Frontier - not one seemed concerned with anything. This airline is not what it used to be.",frontier-airlines,18/06/14,"My daughters flew from KC to Salt Lake City via Denver. They were told in Denver that they could not board after having flown from MCI until they paid additional ""baggage"" fee in the amount of $100.00 for the two small carryon bags that they had. That is one bag each. My daughters were very upset as they had little cash with them and no credit cards. This is a form of extortion as far as I am concerned. I prepaid for their flights with the understanding that this was all paid for. Why would you sell a ticket and not figure that there would be any baggage?",frontier-airlines,16/06/14,DTW-TTN-DTW. Outbound flight was delayed by weather 4+ hours. Not Frontier's fault but once onboard we were charged $1.99 for lukewarm coffee: is it expecting too much to get freebies after such a long delay? Apparently so. But my main gripe is their carry-on policy. It appears based on our experience both ways that after a certain number of passengers have boarded they simply assume the overheads are full and require people to pay extra to check their carry-ons. This happened to us and when we stopped arguing and got on board the overheads were nowhere near full. That's a $50 hit each way.,1frontier-airlines,16/06/14,"First time flying Frontier instead of Southwest and was very disappointed! Not only do they charge you for checking a bag but also for any carry-on and they charge you to sit with your party. The check in process is inefficient and slow the staff are not nice. Once on the flight there is a charge for any beverages and snacks but water is free! They then try and convince you to sign up for their credit card wit their on-board ""deal"" and awkwardly try and explain why it is a good idea. Will definitely be paying a little more to fly Southwest!",1frontier-airlines,13/06/14,Cincinnati OH (CVG) - Denver CO (DEN) Jun 10 2014 F9 0735. Denver CO (DEN) - Cincinnati OH (CVG) Jun 11 2014 F9073. My first around trip flight on Frontier I was sceptical. From the moment I entered the Frontier gate area CVG to Denver flight onboard during the flight and the landing all aspects of the experience was professional. The aircraft's were clean flight crew were making every effort to accommodate the passengers. My return flight was also the same. I would utilize Frontier for my flight service and recommend to others. My one complaint was the long wait for phone service the wait was 20-25 minutes. I feel that's far too long.,10frontier-airlines,13/06/14,Four of us travelled from Philadelphia to Cancun on May 29 2014 flight 19 at 7.15 am. I was not allowed to take my carry-on bag onto the plane unless I paid $50. My other choice was to have them check it for $25 so two of us paid additional $50 for small carry-on bags. The other couple was not charged any money for their carry-on bags with the same customer service representative. My request to speak with supervisor was ignored. The customer service personnel could not have been ruder. On return flight from Cancun to Philadelphia on June 8 2014 we did not have any charges for the same carry-on bags. I will never look at Frontier again when booking a trip.,frontier-airlines,10/06/14,What was once a decent airline is now beyond a nightmare. The new baggage policies are ridiculous. They are taking no frills to new limits and despite the few bucks you save on the ticket price you will end up paying more than competitors in the long run after $2 water charge $50 carry on charge (for the first carry on) and have a poor experience. Customer service if you can even get it is awful. On the phone from a gate agent etc. this airline is almost primitive now. Very disappointing. I will never choose to fly with Frontier again. The one upside is that the flight attendants were courteous and professional.,1frontier-airlines,10/06/14,May 31st 2014 from Denver to Orlando flight 678 return June 6 2014 flight 677. We booked our trip through our travel agent months before these new carry on charges went into effect. We were told we would not have to pay the extra fees. As we arrived at Denver airport and proceeded to the Frontier check in counter we were told we had to pay for our carry ons all of which could fit under the seats we explained what we were told and the check-in guy looked up our booking date and all was fine not the case at the Orlando airport on the way home. We asked for our check in bag back and since we still had 7 lbs allowed in that bag before they added another $75 we started to unpack bags and re-pack so as not to give them one dime more. Needless to say after all the rearranging which was totally unnecessary we were allowed to take our carry on bags as personal items. As I said before we did not have to use the carry on overhead compartments all the bags were so small they fit under the seats with no problem at all. After arriving at the gate we heard several stories like ours. There were so many upset people saying they will never fly Frontier again. It's not just about the money but it's about how you are treated.,1frontier-airlines,06/06/14,Achieved what they offered. TTN-RSW. First flight out. On time boarding departure and landing (a few minutes early). Crowded plane and they checked the size of my personal item 2x. I had to take out a few items (stuffed in my pocket to make it fit) but overall uneventful journey. I can't speak for service as I slept the entire flight and deboarding was uneventful. I faintly remember the offer for water. Seat pitch normal - I didn't pre-assign seat so was in 2nd to last row but had an empty seat next to me. I'm aware Frontier gets a bad-rap due to its fees but if you know what you are getting into I don't see the issue as it is still cheaper vs flying/parking at PHL or EWR for same route.,8frontier-airlines,05/06/14,Flt 232 from Denver to Nashville 06/04. The ticket was not much cheaper than on Southwest. My computer travel system booked it because it was cheaper but it did not figure in the extra $20 for a checked bag and $30 for the carry on bag. Then they charged for a drink and snack! Charged for watching TV yes you have to use your own phone ipad or laptop but it is free. Plus if you want to select you seat in advance it is from $8 to $15 extra. This will be the last time I fly on Frontier.,3frontier-airlines,29/05/14,"After a revolting experience on a Frontier Flight from MCO to DEN we bit the bullet and flew DEN to SLC May 21 (noon). What a difference! Wonderful stewards on board friendly helpful welcoming. Still cannot believe how rude people are when told that their huge bag cannot fit in the overhead just check the damn thing! Saves a few dollars boarding time too but it is funny to watch people unpacking their overhead bag and trying to put all items in their large ""handbag"" then try to hide their now just as big handbag.",8frontier-airlines,26/05/14,I've flown from Harrisburg PA to Orlando FL and back a few times in the past year. Most of the time it was a good experience. One flight which I booked way in advance in the snow season had more than 3 hour delay and I would have missed my appointment so there was no longer a need to fly. I got a refund for which I was thankful. One flight had comedian flight attendants giving the on board preflight information (buckle up etc) that were actually funny. All flights were nonstop from PA to FL which was so nice. The rates were great for an average wage earner like me which was my main reason for choosing Frontier. Now I'm booking 3 tickets for my family and my total bill will be less than I would pay for one ticket with the other major airline flying out of MDT.,9frontier-airlines,26/05/14,Scheduled to fly Frontier 902 ATL to TTN today. Flight canceled without notification or explanation. Next flight offering to TTN was in 5 days! Frontier refused to assist with rebooking on an alternate airline. Offered only refund or hotel voucher. Customer service offered no other assistance. I was left on my own to book same day out of ATL on Memorial holiday (to PHL requiring trains and cab to reach my car at TTN airport). Very expensive out-of-pocket.,frontier-airlines,25/05/14,Arrived at airport 2.5 hours before flight. No one was at the ticket counter despite a line of about 50 people. Shorter line of about 12 at Kiosk but they were having trouble so the line was slow. After finally getting to the kiosk had trouble getting it to work. (Like the others before me.) When it finally did start working I started pressing the continues until I realised that I had just input that I had no carry on. No way to back up so I printed the ticket and got in the line waiting for the ticket counter. After I finally got through all this I got to the gate just in time to board. Never again.,1frontier-airlines,25/05/14,Booked a cruise for the family in Alaska and we were hoping to fly Frontier from ATL to AK but when we got to the airport the airline said flight was delayed for 3 hours. Not a big deal but since we were connected through Denver we would miss our connecting flight. Also happens before not a big deal. The big deal was we would have to lay over in Denver for 2 days. We ended up being able to book a flight on Delta for twice as much and now the nightmare of trying to find out how to get linked up with our ship. Airline was very rude dismissive and well trained in saying sorry. Which is appropriate since this airline is very very sorry all around. Great to book if you don't care much about getting to your destination. Also don't be fooled by the prices. They charge you for both your checked and carry on luggage. They are a complete waste of time and money.,1frontier-airlines,24/05/14,I have flown this airline many times. I saw all the bad reviews and thought while everyone vents when they are frustrated very few take the time to praise when they are satisfied. So here is a satisfied customer. My one wish would be service to Boston or Manchester.,10frontier-airlines,24/05/14,They cancelled our flight from Orlando to Wilmington at the last minute saying the plane did not ever leave Denver. They said maybe they could get us on a flight in 3 days! They would not help even help us find another airline to fly. They just gave us a business card with a 1-800-432-1359 number on it. This had a 67 minute wait time. We had to pay top dollar at US Air to get to a city close to Wilmington.,1frontier-airlines,23/05/14,Hands down worst customer service of any airline/company. I first attempted to call their customer service line to resolve my problem and everytime I called there was a 45+ minute wait so I emailed instead. Keep in mind it takes them 3-4 days to respond to emails (which I find unacceptable) so I tried to work it out with them for a few weeks. Following my initial complaint the customer service rep went in and deleted all my airline miles I had accumulated seeing as how my initial contact with them was resolving and issue on using them. Second they didn't even bother to tell me they deleted the miles they tried to play me for being ignorant and said I had no miles. Three weeks of battling with them they have restored part of my points and refuse to assist with my initial issue of using the points. Absolutely worst customer service ever!,1frontier-airlines,21/05/14,We will not fly with Frontier again. After having paid for tickets for our trip to Costa Rica months in advance we were informed at the gate that our flight was delayed but the check in agent said that we should still be able to make our connecting flight through Denver. So we check our bags ($50 for 2) and go through security. Upon arrival at the gate we were told that we would arrive in Denver at 11:55 p.m. which was the departure time for our connecting flight to Costa Rica. We asked if they would be able to hold the plan for 10 minutes so that we and the 3-4 other passengers who were in the same situation could make the flight. The gate agent said that she had called the staff in Denver and they refused to hold the flight as it would further increase delays. Frustrated we asked to be put on the next flight hoping we could leave the following day at the latest but she told us that the next flight with available seats was in 6 days. We asked to speak to her manager who essentially said that out options were to wait six days or that she could (reluctantly) refund us for the cost of our original flight and book a new flight through a different airline. We had to research flights on our own as they had no intentions of helping us secure seats on a new flight. We ended up paying an additional $400 to book last minute tickets on American Airlines waiting for her to process our refund and get our mailing address to send our checked baggage fee back to us via mail and then rushing to the next terminal to go through security again and catch our flight. Ultimately we paid more than we would have if we'd just booked through American months ago. Plus the lack of customer service or care regarding out situation was infuriating. We are waiting for our flight to Costa Rica as I type this and just praying that they successfully rerouted our bags. Overall a terrible first experience with this airline and we didn't even make it on the plane.,1frontier-airlines,20/05/14,I don't understand the negative reviews. Seating was good. Comfortable seats didn't feel crowded. Entertainment for $4 you get to watch Direct TV. It is free until the flight takes off. If you are really concerned about $4 then I don't know what to say. There were about 30 channels available.,9frontier-airlines,20/05/14,Our flight from Seattle to Branson and back was the worst experience ever. I felt at each terminal that it was their first day in business and they had not worked the bugs out of the system. All the employees seem to be angry about something poor morale and no idea of what customer service is all about. The only good thing about this trip was leaving the Branson airport my wife and I arrived there early no Frontier people there however a Southwest agent checked us in and we had absolutely no problems.,frontier-airlines,20/05/14,MCO to DEN on May 13. I am on crutches and found staff from other airlines to be wonderful helping me but not this time. The stewardess at the front of the plane was the most miserable and unhelpful person I have come across. I don't know why she was even there - a road cone is more useful than she was. She just stood there glaring at everyone that boarded with her arms folded not attempting to help anyone. Abruptly told me to out my crutches in the overhead not attempting to help me do so. The only time she did anything was to miserably ask what people wanted to drink or eat. She was more than annoyed that she had to do anything as it disturbed her gameplay on her phone.,frontier-airlines,12/05/14,Frontier was delayed 120 minutes from new Orleans to Denver for weather in Denver. We were informed all our connecting flights would be delayed and that we would make our connections not to worry. Upon arriving in Denver many passenger's as well as myself learned our flight connections had left. Many appeared to have been delayed 10 minutes or so clearly not inline with the info provided by new Orleans staff Frontier offered to put me on another flight at 4pm the following day and we could sleep in the airport. No other options nor recommendations for other airlines were provided. My husband searched with me and we purchased a one way ticket from Denver to Salt Lake to get home that night. My family will do whatever we can in the future not to fly Frontier Airlines.,frontier-airlines,10/05/14,After reading all of the negative comments on this site I wanted to give some positive information. Most people only write a review when they are unhappy and don't take the time when it is a good experience. We flew from Milwaukee to Denver and then Las Vegas. Everything went very smoothly. All flights were on time. If you don't take time to read all of the rules then be prepared for being unhappy. I checked out everything beforehand and didn't have any surprises. The nice thing about the carry on bag requirement is that it eliminates people from bringing hugs bags on and trying to stuff them in the overhead bins. By limiting this and have the airline actually follow the rules they have makes for everyone getting on the plane and seated so much faster.,8frontier-airlines,06/05/14,"I chose to fly with Frontier because of their low prices. I was not aware that this meant I was sacrificing any type of customer service. I booked a flight from CVG I had not received the online check in email and was not at a place where I had access to a printer so thought it would be easy enough to check in at the counter. This was incorrect there was no kiosk and the line was quite long with several people ahead of me checking bags. Although it was not mentioned in any of my emails Frontier seems to have a strict policy that they will not check you in if your flight is 45 mins or less to boarding. Although we were all in line within this time frame due to the slow movement several of us were not at the counter 45 minutes before our flight. This was handled by one lady looking up at us and saying ""no they are cut off"" and no more. We were all very confused and asked what was going on we needed to check in and she ignored us. There were 3 people at the counter and four in line but they would not respond to us at all just completely ignored us and would not explain what was going on until a fourth attendant came up and asked how she could help. This is a frustrating experience no matter what but to just be ignored like that was one of the rudest ways these staff members could have handled it. I do not plan to continue to fly with Frontier even if does save me a few dollars because people should not be treated that way.",1frontier-airlines,05/05/14,"I will never fly with Frontier again. I was in a rush trying to find flights to make it back home before my grandfather passed away and found some tickets through Orbitz. We were supposed to fly out the next morning at 6.15am. I checked in early online and printed out boarding passes. When we got to MSP we were an hour early. There was no one at the bag check counter so we proceeded to go through security and were told our passes didn't work. We were directed back to the counter to get new passes but by this point we were beyond the 45 minute window and couldn't speak to anyone. While I was on the phone with Frontier explaining what happened they said we had to pay the $100 fee per person to get our flight changed to the next available flight. As I was on the phone they came on the intercom calling our names but we couldn't get through security. We then spent 8 hours in front of the baggage check before we could check our bags and go through security. After being nickled and dimed for every fee they could possibly come up with they have the nerve to say ""you booked on a third party website and can't sit together"".",frontier-airlines,01/05/14,"I do not plan on flying Frontier again. Cannot confirm seats prior to check-in unless you pay however no one explains this. Thus my husband 3 year old and I were all seated in different parts of the plane. Even when I paid to check in early on my return we still were separated. Everything is an additional charge. I would rather pay one price and know that I can have a confirmed seat can carry on a bag and can have one cold beverage on my flight. Flight attendants sit in the back of the plane and read a book. Not sure what the point is in having them. I booked with Amex points (a ""third party"") thus carry on luggage is extra. Pretty much everyone in our line had booked through a ""third party"" so we were all in the same boat. They make everyone have their carry on bag measured which was one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. This created chaos in the waiting area as multiple lines had formed and half the people didn't know what was going on.",frontier-airlines,28/04/14,We left from Omaha and after checking in going through security and getting to our gate we were told to wait in line to put our carry ons and personal items in a slot to see if we would be charged. Very rude same thing happened changing plans in Denver. Leaving Las Vegas at 6.30am told to pay $50 for carry-on I said we didn't on the way out and she said we are a 3rd party and that is how it goes. Wait through a very long security line sit down and again they told us to wait in a very long line to check to see if everyone's carry-on fitted into the slot. I have MS and lines and standing are not the best for me but myself and my husband do what we are told. Never once was there a problem. Staff were not friendly. I travel 12 to 15 times a year for work and have never had to do any of this. Then they come through with the snack and beverage cart and tell you sorry your drink is $1.99. We have never been treated like lower class on any flight business or pleasure. I can assure you we will not save $20 for a flight and go through Frontier ever again. I know everyone wants cut backs but they may want to look at customer service.,frontier-airlines,28/04/14,"Never mind how 100% of everything (drinks food checking baggage) is ""available for a fee"" I understand that is a way to save me some money. What makes this airline the worst experience I have ever had traveling is the fact my flight was delayed - I understand that happens - but that made it so they could not get me on my connecting flight home. They cannot get another flight on their airline for another 2 days. They refuse to help me at the desk I call their customer service line on my own personal phone which took several hours for them to tell me they will not help me get on another airline. I have to stay at the airport for 2 days. Not even an upgraded seat. I saved a little money on Frontier tickets and they are costing me hundreds of dollars. I will never consider giving them my business again.",frontier-airlines,22/04/14,Poor inflexible service. If you don't have your boarding pass printed before you get to the airport you might miss your flight. Their machine shut off 45 min before the flight and they don't staff their counters. 30 min on the phone and they were still inflexible. Couldn't rebook flight until 4 days out. Don't use this airline.,frontier-airlines,21/04/14,SEA to OKC round trip 4/10/2014 coming home on 4/14. I made sure I checked all their rules checked one golf bag online saved 5 dollars each way. Plane was not as clean as would like. Just an uneventful trip with no snags. the Denver to SEA connection was very close time wise. If you do your homework and plan you can save money flying with them. I would fly them again.,5frontier-airlines,15/04/14,My wife and I flew from SEATAC to Midway near Chicago with a stop in Denver. This was round-trip so there were four flights in all. Not one flight left on time. You would think the law of probably would ensure that at least one flight would be on schedule but that was not so. We flew classic plus so we had one free checked bag one free carry-on and a free drink during the flight. I feel sorry for those that had to pay for those things. When did we have to start paying extra for customer service? Since you have to pay extra for everything everybody tries to make all their luggage carry-on. This slowed down the boarding process and only made the whole experience worse. Everything but the seat you were sitting in was extra and it seems that if federal guidelines would allow them to pack more people onto a plane by doing away with the seats they would do that too! The flight attendants were courteous to your face but since we sat in the front right next to them we could overhear them talking about passengers in the back and previous passengers on other flights. Very unprofessional. I would not recommend this airline to anyone expecting a decent experience. If you don't mind being treated like you are cattle being led to slaughter then this airline is for you. I wouldn't fly Frontier again no matter how low the fare is.,4frontier-airlines,13/04/14,I fly all the time and try to fly Frontier if at all possible that is until tonight. I won't be flying them anymore. Flying Denver to Kansas City originally leaving at 7.15. After three gate changes our flight is delayed over 2 hours. Funny thing is there is a later Frontier flight flying to Kansas City and they are boarding now. Everyone is asking why Frontier wouldn't switch planes so earlier flight could leave first. We aren't only people affected either Frontier is moving everyone gate to gate and there are delays galore.,3frontier-airlines,07/04/14,I fly a lot for business and must check a bag for tools. My selected seats (non premium) were rejected at check in and random seats were assigned. I expected baggage fees for checked baggage but my briefcase was large enough to qualify as a carry on instead of a personal item. Sizing explanation was not available until the rate increased from $50 to $100. Random seat assignment always means middle seat assignment. My return flight was not as booked but this may be my travel agent. By the time all of the surprise fees were added I could have flown another carrier for less. They would be better named hidden fee or bait and switch airlines. Alaska Delta and United would be better choices for routes in the Northwest and West. I didn't eat or drink on the flight but n/a is not a review option so I chose no opinion. The flight crew was professional and genial the check in staff was bright and chipper but unhelpful.,2frontier-airlines,30/03/14,Flew PHX-DEN on 3/27 for $90 a person during spring break. Flight was on time boarding quick and organized except for the carry on bag size check which was very unorganized at boarding. Flight attendants gave out water for free and on a 1.5 hr flight food and drink purchases weren't needed. Checked bag was out before we even got to the baggage claim belt. All in all a very positive experience and highly recommend Frontier.,9frontier-airlines,30/03/14,I was penalized because I booked my flight through Orbitz. I had to pay for seats - $8 a piece so that I could sit with my kids. The airlines nickel and dimes you - you pay to carry on or to check a bag. I ended up paying $80 each direction to check 4 bags for my family. Then they give you no beverages for free on the flight - a 4hr flight and you have to pay $2 for a coffee or soda! Finally - their computer system could not let us check in online - because my husband and son share the same full name - one is Jr the other is III. I have never had a problem with this on any other airline. Frontier told me I should have booked their tickets separately.,frontier-airlines,30/03/14,Denver-Orlando and return: March 18-24 (FFT678/FFT681). If you know what you are getting into with this airline it's not half bad. I researched and knew Frontier charges for carry-ons if you don't meet the requirements or book a fare on their website so I made sure to bring a proper sized bag and got on no problem. I do the same thing when I fly Spirit. The customer service wasn't very good in Denver but once on the plane the flight attendants were very nice and helpful especially when my TV broke and the customer service in Orlando was noticeably better. The flight on the way out was delayed due to snow and wind but I can't fault Frontier. Overall an enjoyable experience and considering they have TV (yes they charge but so do most others) I did my research and they were nearly $200 cheaper than the nearest non-stop competitor I would certainly would continue flying them again.,7frontier-airlines,29/03/14,Des Moines to Las Vegas March 24 2014 and return on March 27 2014. One of the legs was flight 782 on March 27th. They reel you in with a low fare and then nickel and dime you to death. As a business traveler I'll steer clear of this airline from this point forward.,2frontier-airlines,28/03/14,"Flight 667 March 7 2014 Cleveland to San Francisco. My 19 year old daughter booked a flight in early March and had two small carry on bags. When she checked in no one at Frontier mentioned anything about a charge for a second carry on. When she got to the gate they told her she needed to pay $100 for the second carry on. She offered to check-in the second small bag and was told ""no we have to charge you $100."" She ended up having to check the bag anyway but they still charged her $100.",frontier-airlines,27/03/14,I flew from Denver to San Diego on 8.59pm flight. We did not board until 9.20pm and started to taxi but returned to the gate due to the plane had a malfunction with one engine. We didn't taxi for another 20 minutes which all of this caused a serious delay! All of these events seemed to be a disorganization on Frontiers' behalf. After all of this confusion and frustration Frontier employees acted as if they did passengers a favor. No compensation was awarded i.e. beverages or anything. On top of this distraction I landed late causing my rental car reservation to be cancelled and had to barter with taxi drivers for transportation to my hotel. As far as I'm concerned this airline has the worst customer service bar none!,2frontier-airlines,18/03/14,I have flown Frontier before and thought that for the price it was a good option. However I suppose it had been longer than I remember since I experienced Frontier. I was told that my carry on was too big (I have taken it on every flight for years including Frontier) and that I had to check it. Then I was told that whether I checked the bag or carried it on that I would be charged an extra fee! I specifically travel light to avoid fees and baggage mix ups. I actually drive an extra hour to get to an airport that includes Frontier so that I can get a good deal. Never again. I hate to say this as I am a working person myself and don't quickly complain about service but unfortunately the Frontier employees were plain rude. I can almost overlook this since I would be frustrated with all the angry customers if I had to deal with them too. Frontier doesn't seem to care about the passengers anymore.,1frontier-airlines,17/03/14,March 3 2014 â€“ Flight F9 395 ILGâ€“DEN. March 5 2014 â€“ Flight F9 396 DENâ€“ILG. Thank you Frontier for my recent ILGâ€“DEN flight coincidently on the Alberta Clipper and Polar Bear tail ID. The New Castle (Wilmington DE) Airport was pretty much the only game in town during the March 3 snowstorm. Nearby Philadelphia Airport was all but closed. This was true for earlier snowstorms too. Our flight was delayed about an hour due to de-icing issues not the airlineâ€™s fault. This little airport has all the charm of a Soviet-era military installation but Iâ€™ll gladly forego shopping mall ambience for short lines free parking easy access and cheap flights. I carried-on so can't comment on baggage. Service was comparable to other low-cost domestic carriers. Return DEN-ILG was delayed about 20 minutes. Their Mediterranean Sky Snacks Box was purchased for $7 and it was ample tasty and good value for money.,7frontier-airlines,13/03/14,I used to be a big fan of Frontier but no more. Three of us travelled from DFW to SLC for spring break. Much to my surprise I was not allowed to take my carry-on bag onto the plane unless I paid $100. My other choice was to have them check it for $35 more than if I had checked it in initially. The gate personnel could not have been ruder. I will never look at Frontier again when booking a trip.,frontier-airlines,11/03/14,My husband lives in Chicago and I live in the Northeast. One of us flies every two weeks. We use Frontier on a regular basis and while I think they can improve on the carry on bag size checking process other than that we've both been more than impressed with the low fares and clean safe planes. The flight crew are funny and make the trip seem quick.,9frontier-airlines,10/03/14,This was my first and last flight with Frontier. We arrived at DIA with plenty enough time to drop off our bags and make it in time to the gate for departure. However when we tried to print our already completed boarding passes and drop off our bags the computer directed us to go directly to the gate. The only option we were given was to re-book a later flight at a cost of $100 per person (5). We were not treated properly and can only anticipate how we will be treated once we actually get on the next flight. I already do not like the cost to pick a seat and the cost to bring luggage and will try to stick with Southwest for future flights. Judging from the other posts it is clear Frontier has a serious PR problem and doesn't care about customer service.,frontier-airlines,04/03/14,"2013 Christmas Vacation from Atlanta Georgia to Trenton New Jersey. I found a ticket within my budget and booking the ticket was easy. Boarding was done quickly and very organized. The stewardesses were kind and very helpful to passengers. The only difficulty I experienced was with the ticket checker upon boarding in Atlanta after I learned that my bag wasn't within standard regulations to be a carry on. This one young lady was very rude and short with me. She took no time at all to explain to me the steps that I needed to take to secure my bag from the gate. Her only reply was ""You're not getting on this plane."" I was quite taken back by her rudeness. However as quickly as she had insulted me another young lady at the desk came to my rescue and she was very helpful and polite. I was able to check my bag and board my flight without further incident. The plane was clean and the flight was quiet and friendly.",10frontier-airlines,27/02/14,My husband and I got to the airport to discover that the flight had been delayed 10 hours. There was only one person behind the desk to re-route an entire plane of people. We got in line and the line had barely moved in 2 hours. I called Frontier was told that the next time we could get out to our destination was 5 days from then. I then went to the American Airlines counter-they said if Frontier was willing to release the first half of our tickets they would be glad to honor them. I called Frontier and they refused. When I tried to reschedule the return date for 5 days later the agent said they would do that but we would have to pay 100$ each for a rebooking fee. Everyone in line had horror stories about Frontier.,frontier-airlines,26/02/14,Orlando to Denver. First and last time I will fly with Frontier. Very rude and disrespectful flight attendants. They were the most unprofessional crew I have seen. They treated everybody like they were doing them a favor. They simply don't realize that customers pay their wages. It's just not worth it.,frontier-airlines,20/02/14,This was my first and last experience with Frontier Airlines. I bought my ticket not directly from Frontier Airlines and found they treat these tickets as if you are an inferior customer. I paid to check in my luggage and not one word was mentioned about my carry on I proceeded to the gate and was told I had to pay $100 to get on with my carry on bag. I travel often and have never had to pay for a carry on. The gate agent had terrible customer service and when I finally made it on the plane everyone around me was also complaining about the horrible customer service.,frontier-airlines,19/02/14,The first time I have used Frontier and it will be the last. Everything was fine until I was boarding and then they said that my ticket didn't say carry on.I had to walk to the check in desk which was about 20 feet away and tell them. This is when I was told that I needed to pay $100. After that shock and paying the money they then told me to carry my bag and go ahead and get on the plane. On my return flight I made sure that I told the check in attendant that I had a carry on and needed to have it on my ticket so I wouldn't have to pay 100 more dollars. She then said my bag was too big and would have to be checked. I have used this bag for many flights and never has it been to big for carry on. It is the standard size approved for airline carry on. Worst airline I have flown.,frontier-airlines,17/02/14,Our flight was cancelled due to the recent snow was told since we didn't buy our ticket from them we have no travel options to get rebooked. Now on my 3rd day of standby. Everyone I have dealt with has been rude and gives conflicting advice. We were offered another flight in a week or money back. Problem is this is a family vacation now with lost rental car lost ski condo etc. no offer to switch airlines or rebook as things settled out from storm. No offers to get others to give up their seats. Never seen anything like it.,frontier-airlines,13/02/14,Flight 668 and 678 on Feb 4 2014. Tries to charge you for every little thing. Who ever heard of charging for carry-on baggage? As if it costs them anything for me to drag on my own suitcase hoist it up to the overhead compartment and then lug it back down! Why do they charge so I can pick my seats? $1.95 for a Coke? There was no airsick bag when I started feeling nauseous. Luckily the stewardess got a plastic bag to me on time but how many times does someone have to wait 5-10 minutes for a stewardess to show up and no one does? Finally they spend half the flight trying to get me to buy a frequent flyer credit card. I'd rather drive.,frontier-airlines,10/02/14,I wish I had read these before booking. We booked our flight through another site so had to pay for bags (the only way we knew about the flight was because of the other site you would think they would be glad for the business) travelled with children could not sit together ended up in middle seats throughout the plane. We arrived at our initial airport on time but the incoming flight was late so we got in late to Denver they let us off the plane to try to make it we ran to the gate to be told (with 10 other passengers) that they released the plane. We were four minutes late apparently that was the one flight that could not be late we were trying to make a reception that night in SLC so had few other options. Customer service was the worst I have experienced in 40+years several different people sat at the counters without acknowledging customers when they did talk to us they were extremely rude acted inconvenienced by customers. We've flown 4 airlines this year this was our first and last for Frontier. Awful not worth the cheap tickets we got nickel and dimed and treated unprofessionally.,1frontier-airlines,07/02/14,"I caught a Frontier Airlines flight from San Francisco to Denver CO then from Denver to Cincinnati on Feb 5th 2014. The airfare is reasonable but I was surprised to learn that you cannot choose a seat in advance I was charged $50 for a carryon luggage plus another $25 for a ""preferred seat"". The agent at the gate later explained to me that I had a ""basic"" ticket which does not afford passengers with similar benefits than those who book their flights through Frontier AL website. Another surprise is they charge passengers to watch onboard Direct TV ($5.95) plus $1.95/standard beverage such as Pepsi products coffee etc.",frontier-airlines,05/02/14,Another awful experience by this the worst of US carriers. Flew IAH-DEN one way only good part was that the ticket was cheap and flight left on time. Previous flights all delayed by at least an hour. Crew were surly and rude and didn't want to be there. One attendant barked at passengers to not put bags in the overhead unless it was their row (never heard that before). Another yelled at me for keeping my Iphone on during taxiing which is allowed by every other airline now (TSA/FAA have change the rules). Worst part is they charge you for a can of soda ($2) and make a big deal about giving you the whole can!,1frontier-airlines,03/02/14,Flew Frontier for first and last time to Nashville-Phoenix. Connecting flight delayed 45 minutes due to mechanical problem with door. Return trip: Phoenix-Denver flight ok. Flight from Denver to Nashville took off and had to return to Denver (plane landing gear unable to retract). In both situations staff had very poor communication informing passengers of situation. Rudest flight attendants I have experienced. No compensation for inconvenience or lost time due to delays. Frontier is an economy airline I get it. They want to charge you for anything/everything they can. Baggage food and beverages.,frontier-airlines,29/01/14,Just did a round trip from Salt Lake to Orlando changing in Denver. We had pre chosen seats on Orbitz we arrived and had been separated for our flights what would posses a company to charge for a carry on I paid $20 for a checked bag and then was stiffed for $25 for a carry on. But here is the good part when boarding in Denver from Salt Lake the plane was late so we had to rush to the next and was treated horrible by the flight attendant saying we couldn't come on late and expect a place for our carry on (the one I paid $25 for). No complimentary snacks or beverages.,frontier-airlines,28/01/14,"I booked a flight on Frontier for my parents on Oribz.com. Their whole Frontier Airlines experience was a disaster. The Frontier employees told my parents that because they booked on through a third party that their seat assignments would not be honored. My senior citizen parents were crammed in the last row by the bathrooms and made to feel like it was their fault because of where they bought their tickets. They were not seated together. They were surprised to find out upon check in that carry on bags are not free even though the Frontier website chart says that ""Economy"" tickets are free. They came to learn that this is only if you book directly through Frontier. Very misleading. They had to pay $50 to take their carry on. The gate attendants were rude. My parents arrived early for their return flight and were made to feel stupid for getting there 2.5 hours early. The gate attendant told them to just sit there and ""someone will be around at some point"". So tricky baggage fees rude employees and being treated like you in trouble because you bought your ticket off Orbitz all equal one bad experience and the fact that our family will never fly Frontier again.",2frontier-airlines,23/01/14,My wife and daughter flew out the day after Christmas (2013) and arrived 2 hours prior to boarding as recommended. Much to our surprise the line to check baggage was extremely long compared to what the other airlines were experiencing. It was apparent that Frontier was under staffed behind the counters so by the time it was our turn to check in the gate was closed for our flight. They did not have an express check in so we were out of luck as this would have helped. Fortunately a relative gave us her miles for my wife and daughter to fly on Delta and after explaining to the Delta representative what had happened they were given priority check in and they were on a flight 3 hours later to their destination. After numerous phone calls with waits of up to 1 1/2 hours Frontier gave us vouchers for the fight that was missed. We have always had great experiences with Frontier over the years but apparently with all the reorganizations buyouts etc.. have lost the customer service they once had.,frontier-airlines,15/01/14,Traveled from Trenton NJ to Fort Myers week before Thanksgiving. It was one of the most pleasant flights I've had in a long time. They have a small terminal in Trenton not like dealing with Newark. Check-in staff were nice and security was quick. They have a tiny store in the small waiting area to buy snacks/drinks. Plane was about 30 minutes late but once it got there they had us boarded and doors closed in about 15 minutes. They boarded from the middle to front and middle to back - common sense! Flight crew very pleasant. I didn't like the idea you could only purchase drinks or snacks or TV with a credit or debit card no cash. The plane was very clean restrooms spotless flight quiet and comfortable. In Fort Myers I went to the first baggage claim to find my luggage already on the rack. I spent less than five minutes in Fort Myers airport! Return flight was on time and flight crew was also fun. Boarding was organized: first 4 rows then those who had carry-ons that would fit under the seat. I got on then and everyone with bags for overhead got on quickly with much less stress than the Continental flight I took in May. Return flight the same as the first quiet and on time. I had to pay $25 for my luggage each way but not for carry-on. For me this was a great value: $178 round trip and $50 total for baggage. From the comments above some encounter problems with Frontier but it seems to be mostly on connecting flights. I will definitely give Frontier another try as my experience this time was very good!,10frontier-airlines,14/01/14,Our flight was Kansas City to Denver with a connection in Denver to Las Vegas on Mon Jan 6th. Flight scheduled to leave at 6.30am. Flight delayed 4 hours supposedly for mechanical issues. They do not communicate to passengers or update on status. Many people were led to believe they will make connections and waited for info for 2-4 hours to be told they will not make their connecting flight. When we finally arrived in Denver we were told to go to Customer Service to reschedule our connecting flight and waited in excess of 4 hours just to get to the counter. Told that the next flight out would be the next day! Finally we got food vouchers we had been at Frontiers mercy for over 18 hours. After arriving at 3am at Las Vegas airport we had to get our luggage out of impound. From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket purchased through a third-party vendor that our carry-on bag would be $100 per bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverages offered without a charge incurred. The recent addition of fees for everything but use of the bathroom has taken Frontier Airlines to the very bottom of the food chain. Our return flight was no better. We made it on the Las Vegas flight to Denver. When we got to Denver our flight was delayed. Our plane was to leave at 9.13pm. We got food and started back to the terminal and when we got there they wouldn't open the doors to let us on the plane. This was 9.10pm. We were told to go to Customer Service to be rescheduled for another flight. By the time we got down to the Customer Service desk the woman was very rude and said that she couldn't do anything without us paying an additional $100. I paid the money and got a stand-by for 10.12am and a confirmation for a 3pm flight. We spent the next 13 hours sitting at the boarding gate. No where to lay down but on the floor and again our luggage made its way home but we didn't. I will never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,10/01/14,Over winter break my family enjoyed a wonderful Skiing vacation in Colorado. My boyfriend and I had to leave the trip early. Because of this we paid a shuttle service to get us to the airport early on Sunday morning. When we got to the airport we saw the Frontier flight was delayed 2 hours. No text no call no email to warn us of this inconvenience. When we got to the gate I politely asked the lady what the problem was weather mechanical or just a delay at the other airport. She told me it was mechanical. With that I asked if we could be compensated for our time in the airport with food vouchers. She replied that the delay was not set in stone and therefore would not reward customers. The flight did not leave for another 3 hours and we were not compensated for any food during that time. I was extremely disappointed and plan to never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,09/01/14,"I traveled Frontier to come home from Los Angeles. Frontier has a rule that their ticketing counters open 2 hours prior to departure. Arrived at the LAX ticket counter a little early and had to wait 45 minutes for an agent to check me in. However agents were very nice and got me checked in fine. I flew to Denver from LAX and had no complaints with flight attendants and pilots. My second flight was from Denver (depart at 5pm) to Cleveland. I went up to the agent at the gate to ask a question. He greets me with ""Yo."" I found that to be very unprofessional. We ended up departing at 7pm I have never boarded a plane so slowly. We landed in Cleveland around midnight. It must be a Frontier thing to be understaffed when unloading bags off the aircraft because that was the case. With all of this said I will never be flying Frontier Airlines ever again.",1frontier-airlines,09/01/14,I flew from Orlando to Trenton NJ. Flight delayed twice but did take off finally. When the flight arrived in Trenton the pilot announced that the runway was too icy to land. We circled for 45 minutes more they tried to de ice the runway. No success! The pilot announced we would now land in Wilmington Delaware and a representative would meet us and provide hotel accommodations. They kept us on the runway for almost 90 minutes and we were told that they were making accommodations for everyone with hotels. Finally get into the airport and are told that they have no intention of providing of providing hotel accommodation. We sit for almost 90 minutes and are told they hired a bus to transport people. Too icy to land a plane but they felt is was fine to put people on a bus. Airport was closing and they were not offering any other options. Arrived back at Trenton 3.30 am. I will never fly this airline again and I don't care how cheap it is absolutely awful service.,frontier-airlines,09/01/14,Kansas City to Denver connection on Mon Jan 6th. Will never book Frontier again. Surprise fees at the gate. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours supposedly for mechanical issues. They do not communicate to passengers or update on status. Many people were led to believe they will make connections and waited for info for 2-4 hours to be told they will not make their connections. Passengers were in a line to schedule alternative flights to find 1 agent to assist them. Then told you will need to call their 800 number. No excuse for that kind of customer service.,frontier-airlines,08/01/14,I do not recommend this airline for people traveling between Chicago and Trenton. The primary reason: the lack of any semblance of a contingency plan in the event of weather related travel delays. Our Monday flight home to Chicago was cancelled due to weather (not the airlines fault) however the next available flight was Thursday (3 days later). The announcement was made by an attendant yelling it through the terminal and passengers had to quickly get in line in the hope they would get on the flight. The attitude of the attendants was apathetic and no efforts were made to help customers rebook a different flight. Certainly no notion of adding an additional flight to help customers reach their final destination. There was minimal assistance helping people find transportation from the airport find lodging for the evening and it felt like we were being pushed out the door as everyone was scrambling to change their plans and find a way home. General complaints include: understaffed baggage drop-offs confusing and useless signage extremely slow kiosks. There is a general apathy towards customer service - individual front line employees are generally nice and helpful but there is an evident lack of organization and customer concern. The airfare is cheap but you get what you pay for.,frontier-airlines,07/01/14,"Was booked on a flight from Tampa - Trenton on 1/3/14. Flight was cancelled about 4 hours prior to departure and I was left stranded without any options. Frontier stated they could not fly me out for another 4 days and refused to put me on another carrier or on their next departing flights stating ""they are already full and you don't have a guaranteed seat"". This is totally unacceptable. I had to spend hours on the phone with other airlines and incur excessive charges to take a last minute flight and change my car return time. Would not recommend this airline if it was the only airline.",frontier-airlines,06/01/14,"We drove 5 hours out of our way to receive what we thought was a discounted ticket for four traveling to Mexico. $180 later for baggage fees and we should have just booked Delta or United for about the same price. It is a ""hidden"" fee and is not ethical. They specifically ensure that your not aware of the policy. I fly a lot for business and its standard to pay for bags exceeding 40-50 lbs and can also be policy to pay for checked bags (domestic) but I have never heard of having to pay for carry-on baggage that meets their size and weight criteria. If they would have been upfront about it we wouldn't have went through the trouble of ensuring that we were brining four small bags that met their height width length and weight requirements and would have just had two bags and saved ourselves half the cost. Even worse this is on an international flight. I could truthfully not care less about drinks and snacks but a 5 hour flight and they want you to pay for a cup of coffee? I feel as if they should be paying me for the 3 hour delay on each side of my flight that was caused by their incompetence if they are going to nickel and dime their ""customers"" for every last item. Watch out next time you get on a Frontier flight they will probably have a visa machine to gain access to the bathrooms.",frontier-airlines,02/01/14,My husband and I are just returning from vacation and are waiting to board our final flight of our journey home to Denver. We arrived at the Frontier ticket counter this morning to find that we could not carry on our bags for free as we had on the way out - today it would cost either $25 to check each bag or $50 to carry them on. This was a sneaky tactic by frontier - very clever to gouge the budget traveler when they believe they have accounted for all costs at the end of their trip. Of course our hands were tied and we had no logical choice but to pay! Wow. My resolution in 2014: no more flights with Frontier.,2frontier-airlines,30/12/13,I think Frontier should remove their inclusion on the cheap-fare sites because when you get to the airport you are told that because you bought your ticket on one of these sites you have to pay $55 for your carry-on etc. The departure and return flights were changed and I had to stay five days longer than planned. Also the people using these sites were put in the very back where the seats don't recline. This would all be fine except by the time Frontier gets done with you you might as well have paid regular fare. Every airline I have ever used cheap fare or not will email when the departure time has been changed even by only 5 min. You rescheduled your departure time for 25 min. earlier without letting me know. I was lucky to get to airport in time. I will never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,29/12/13,We fly Frontier only because it is the only airline that provides direct flights to Madison WI. I would like to admonish everyone not to leave the check-in desk without checking if you received all tickets that you purchased. We wasted 40 minutes with 3 kids under three at the check-in desk checking in our bags. At first the agent was too lazy to carry several credit card transactions for checked in luggage and was saying that she would check in two bags under one passenger's name and another bag under another passenger's name (we had 3 tickets) - we ended up paying $5.00 more which is not a big deal but the agent's attitude was far from professional. After that ordeal we have to return to the check in desk two times as the agent printed only one boarding pass at a time without checking that there three tickets under the same reservation and that happened two times! In addition the crew was out of soap and coffee and by mistake took our bag thinking that it belongs to the crew member. We were happy that it was only a 1.5 hr flight. In general the service was not so bad but little customer service issues ruined the pleasure of having a nice flight.,3frontier-airlines,29/12/13,"I'm a Summit member with Frontier and have been for approx 10 years. In short I booked 4 'Classic Plus' seats for myself and family in October and was told that I could not select seats at that time. So exactly 24 hours prior to the flight tried to check in and received 4 seats (none of the 'Classic Plus' variety scattered throughout the plane). These are all middle seats too. I suggest no-one fly Frontier unless you have time to waste (flights are always delayed) travel alone (can't get seats together) and have no baggage (carry on or otherwise). If you are sane and can do the math by the time you book their ""Ultra Low Cost Carrier' fare add in baggage ($50.00 at min) and carry-on ($25.00 at min) you've just paid the same price as United Delta etc. and get to buy your own water.",frontier-airlines,25/12/13,I read other messages on this board and arrived at Denver Airport fearing the worst. At it happened my experience was entirely opposite. My wife and I fly had booked on Frontier understanding that like other low cost airlines (e.g. Air NZ) you get what you pay for. We had never flown Frontier before. We are Americans but have lived overseas (mostly Australia) for several decades and have been consistently amazed when flying in the USA at the huge suitcases that are show-horned into overhead luggage areas supposedly as carry on. Carry on for us elsewhere is an enforced max 7kg (15 lb) and much smaller in size than the Frontier allowance though admittedly at no cost. We had prompt service from a polite and friendly service team who went out of their way to find for us a luggage option that minimised cost and maximised our enjoyment.,8frontier-airlines,21/12/13,On October 24 2013 my sister and I began a long-awaited vacation with flights from SLC to Denver and one from Denver to Fort Lauderdale. SLC to Denver leg of the journey went without a hitch. We were not questioned about our carry-on bags or our purses. When we went to board our flight in Denver we were rudely told we could not take our carry-on bags because they were too large and would have to pay an exorbitant charge for it ($100). The Customer Service person told us to go to a kiosk several gates away and pay for our bag knowing full well that if we did so we would miss our flight. We were forced to pay the charge of $100 per bag. I observed at least 15 people on the flight that had bags two and three times larger than the size of my bag. We were then put into seats that had the least amount of leg room that I have come across. When we finally got to Fort Lauderdale out of curiosity I tried the pre-formed compartments that several airlines had in front of their check in gates. My bag fit easily into each of them with room to spare. At least we were finally able to go on our vacation no thanks to Frontier. On November 4 the trouble started again. When we checked in at Fort Lauderdale we were told that the flight was delayed by one hour because of mechanical problems. That delay would mean that we would miss our connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake. They said they would get us on a partner airline. A gate agent had put us on an American Airlines afternoon flight. When we tried to check in at American Airlines we were told that the gate agent had not called and confirmed us. Fortunately for us American was kind enough to work with us and find us a late flight to Dallas that then connected on to Salt Lake.,1frontier-airlines,20/12/13,Flight 403 from Denver to LAX on 12/18/2013. I am a Denver native and resident and the decline in the quality of this airline is sad to me. It was never a top tier airline in quality but the recent addition of fees for everything but use of the bathroom has taken it to the very bottom. Want to select your own seat? $8. Stretch seating? $20. Carry-on bag? $25 each way. Seltzer water? $3. Oh and today you have to stand in a new separate line where they force you to stuff said $25 carry-on into a sizing box. If you don't they won't allow you to board the plane. The staff is inflexible probably because of the new corporate rules. Two round trip flights in the last month they are my last ever on Frontier.,2frontier-airlines,17/12/13,I bought a classic plus ticket so that I wouldn't have to pay at check in. However if you check in online you still must wait in line (this was in Seattle and OKC) because there is no curbside drop off. You are better off using the kiosk to check in at the airport because you will receive priority for baggage check. They are severely understaffed and use outdated computers and communication systems so everything is super slow for check in. At OKC two of the 3 kiosks weren't working. Of the 4 flight attendant crews that I experienced on this trip one crew was awful and one crew was great. it had been a while since I had flown on Frontier and I'm with other reviewers when I say never again. Unbelievable.,3frontier-airlines,14/12/13,I've flown Frontier 3 times in the last year. Each experience worse than the prior. They now charge $50 for a carry on bag $25 for a checked bag. Tha last time my seat was taken by another passenger and the flight attendant made me sit between two larger passengers. Never again.,2frontier-airlines,13/12/13,My family and I got to the airport at 5.05 because we dropped our rental at around and 4.40 got the documentation for that one. Now earlier in the day we were notified via email that our 5.45 had been changed to 5.55. Upon trying to check a car seat and a bag which we per paid for at the same time we checked in online more than 3 hours before we were told that could not happen because the time had been changed back to 5.45. I know about the 45 minute cut off time some airports have but it was still showing a departure time of 5.55pm on the departure board and the best part is it didn't even leave until after 6.10. I was given the option to pay 50 dollars more per person for a flight leaving the next day but the wife and I had to work the next day. I basically had to pay $370 to get home. I will pay more to never fly them again.,2frontier-airlines,10/12/13,"Very unlikely I will use Frontier again. Three of us flew from NYC to Portland OR on Dec 2 2013. I bought the tickets through a 3rd party so I had no idea they charged for both checked and carry on bags. Frontier is the only airline that charges for carry on bags. I believe these are hidden costs that they're passing on to consumers and that this practice is unlawful. Aren't the airlines required to disclose all costs? Also their system of charges is complex as is the various ""classes"" of customers. I am so annoyed at having to pay an additional $110 for the bags.",frontier-airlines,09/12/13,First of all I looked online and they said first baggage was free. Got there had to pay $25. The flight had to make an emergency landing (I understand things happen). Got a hotel voucher to stay the night and the desk clerk said this happens all the time! Never again. It is taking 22 hrs and 3 flights to get from Houston to Albuquerque!,frontier-airlines,09/12/13,I will never use this airline again. I had no idea that they charge passengers for carry on bags if you use a third party vendor to book your flight. That is not a deal. We observed numerous travelers being advised of this policy at the time of boarding. Also they charge $2 for a small cup of water. Don't use this airline.,frontier-airlines,06/12/13,"I discovered that they have upped their price for checked baggage and now charge $1.99 for inflight sodas. I then missed my connecting flight due to an error on the counter attendant's part and was charged an additional $50 to change to the next flight. When I calmly explained the situation I was told that I was the only person to miss the flight. She rudely dismissed my further request for a supervisor and demanded payment unless I was ""no longer interested in reaching my final destination."" My traveling is not yet over and I have already encountered further issues with this airline just in one day. I shudder to think what my return trip will be like. Throughout this ordeal I have encountered the same attitude with each Frontier representative. The customer service is absolutely atrocious the employees do not seem to care and I have found that Frontier does not uphold the typical customer service mantra that ""The Customer is Always Right.""",frontier-airlines,05/12/13,We flew Frontier for the first time and it was definitely our last time. I've never heard of an airline that charges for carry on $50 a piece soft drinks $1.99 TV $5.99 and to top it all multiple delays. Customer Service was horrible. One of the check-in agents drove a lady into tears. It was horrible to watch. We also had problems getting seat assigned together but thank you to passengers who were kind enough to switch. Please beware If you book through a third party you will pay for your carry on.,frontier-airlines,04/12/13,"I was traveling with my wife and booked two tickets together. When we tried to check in (exactly 24 hours before the flight) we couldn't select seats and the seats that Frontier assigned to us weren't together - we were sitting in different sections of the airplane not even anywhere close to each other. At the airport we were told that because we don't have ""status"" we couldn't select seats and they had no obligation to let us sit together. When we protested the Frontier rep told us we should be happy that we have a confirmed seat at all. Apparently Frontier has a new policy to specifically not let passengers who travel together sit together so they can split them up and stick them in middle seats. This lets them charge extra for aisle and window seats or just entirely reserve them for their ""elite"" passengers. Do not fly Frontier. They don't notify you when you buy your ticket that your party will not sit together. On top of that they nickel-and-dime passengers at every step. You want to choose a seat? You have to pay. You want a soft drink during the flight? That will be $1.99. Want to use the TV screen? $3.99. Oh and if you buy a ticket via another website (instead of Frontier's website) they will charge you $100 for your carry-on bag. I think the next logical step for Frontier is to start charging for using the lavatory for reclining your seat and for using the reading light.",frontier-airlines,03/12/13,"SAN-DEN. Online booking was horrible - Select outbound flight select return flight change return flight. Frontier then changes your outbound flight to the first one available (the wrong one). Call to change with 48 minute hold time. Called the next day to change (only 28 minutes wait!) Charge to change the flight $150/person. So for the cost of a round trip flight my wife and I were charged to select the correct flight that Frontier erroneously picked for us. Pros: None. Cons: customer service has excessive hold times. Cost to change a flight not commensurate with the cost of the flight/available flights. Frontier refused to admit their website was faulty. Do not fly Frontier. Unless you like ""saving"" $50/flight and then giving it back for checked bags carry- on bag and a drink of water. Same business model as Spirit - cheap flight but not worth it at all.",1frontier-airlines,28/11/13,"This is the first time I've flown Frontier and it will be the last. Want something to drink? $2. They will give you one glass of water for free. Want something to eat? $6. Want to bring a carry-on? $25. Want enough legroom to fit your legs between your seat and the seat in front of you? That will be $5 $15 $25 or $50. Want to watch TV? $6. Want to check in online? Good luck - said I had to check in at the airport. I even went to the airport to check in and at 8.05 the attendant said ""sorry closed at 8pm come back tomorrow.""",1frontier-airlines,19/11/13,I booked through 3rd party which prohibits you from choosing a seat at all and no confirmation until 24 hours before. Used the mobile application to check in terrible application to say the least and no paperless option like United. First time I've ever had to pay for a carry on and normally fly United or Southwest. Got to the gate and they made everyone put their bags through a pre-check to make sure bags were the right size. What a hassle for those who travel all the time. Frontier used to be a good airline but they're just making it difficult for customers to travel with them. This is the last time I will ever fly with this airline.,frontier-airlines,13/11/13,I was a loyal Frontier Airlines customer for forty years. Not any more. I will not fly Frontier again if I can avoid it. Just as others have posted here the customer service is terrible they will charge you outrageous fees wherever they can and the flights are not on time. Avoid this airline if you can. I fly other airlines quite frequently for business. American United Delta Southwest and US Airways all do a much better job.,2frontier-airlines,10/11/13,I live in Colorado and have used them for years. They were a great airline until they were bought by Republic a while back. The latest purchase by the owner of Spirit Airlines has gutted the airline I liked so much. Just spent 10 minutes waiting in line to measure my carry on bag. This is my 4th flight with them this year. In the future I will use United Southwest or Delta.,2frontier-airlines,07/11/13,This airline not only charges for checked baggage but also your carry on. If you pay for it prior to going to the gate its $50 a bag and $100 at the gate. I fly 75 flights a year on various airlines this is the first flight I have flown on frontier and will be the last myself or any other employee in my company will fly on Frontier Airlines. I knew their business practice was to underpay their employees which will lead to terrible customer service so I should have been surprised that they would nickle and dime their customers. Avoid.,frontier-airlines,06/11/13,My flights were excellent however on the Denver to KC flight I was charged $50 for my carry-on bag. This was surprising since I had already paid $25 in Kansas before leaving. In Palm Desert I was not charged at all. It was a little confusing.,5frontier-airlines,04/11/13,"I purchased a Frontier ticket from Minneapolis to San Francisco through Orbitz. Frontier changed my departure light from a 10.45am to 6am flight leaving me with a 5 hour layover and necessitated getting up early and driving myself to the airport (paying for parking). Frontier repeatedly admitted they did not inform me of this significant change in flights. I discovered the change during check-in the night before and called Orbitz. Orbitz tried to rebook me but said Frontier refused to adjust my flights. I then paid $25 to carry on my own bag and they demanded I check it instead. When I asked for a plastic bag to put some things in they laughed refused and told me ""that's why you have hands."" On arrival in Denver I found there was another Frontier flight leaving for SFO in 45 min. I was told there were plenty of open seats and was sent to customer service to change the ticket. The agent again admitted they changed my flight without informing me but demanded I pay $125 to change the ticket. She stated they will only help customers who buy directly through their website. I called Frontier and all they could offer me was to mail a copy of my itinerary to my home (not helpful). I have never encountered such a rude unhelpful company and will never fly Frontier again. Avoid!",frontier-airlines,01/11/13,I am a frequent flier on various airlines but trying Frontier was the worst mistake I've made. My trip was supposed to start from Portland OR and end in Houston TX. At the airport they had only one check in counter and only 2 representatives and when I arrived 50 minute before departure there was no representative at the check in counter. I tried the kiosk machine to check in but it said I needed to check in at the counter. I contacted the company and was put on hold for almost 2 hr. on and off. When I decided to rebook they told me to pay $100 despite a long wait and their fault. I only had a small carry on and my suit but they told me to check in my small carry on and pay $25. Frontier is a rip off unprofessional customer service and a disgrace to the airline industry. Based on my experience I would never use Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,29/10/13,F9 846 SEA to DEN Oct 24. F9 182 DEN to OKC. Return F9 185 OKC to DEN F9 841 DEN to SEA. This trip with Frontier Airlines was one of the worst airline experiences. Many of the flight attendants knocked you every time they walked down the aisles. Never an apology. You had to ask for a cup of water. You had to pay for soft drinks. If we can help it we will never fly Frontier again. The only good thing was they were on time but other than that terrible service.,frontier-airlines,29/10/13,They charge for everything you can get one tiny glass of water and then you have to pay. Inflight entertainment was non existent unless you pay. Also I was unaware of the fact that if you don't check in at least 45 min before your flight that they will bump you. I checked in 44 min before my flight and they refused to let me board. I had to buy a $400 one way ticket from Southwest just to make it to my second leg and then they told me I would have to pay a change fee and fare difference on a flight I already bought. I will never fly Frontier again.,1frontier-airlines,22/10/13,Washington - Denver - Albuquerque. Flights: 721 335 340 724. 10/15/13 - 10/21/2013. Seats assigned at last minute. I was told I could pay more to get a better seat assignment. All passengers had to line up twice once to verify size of carry on and another to board.,frontier-airlines,22/10/13,Not a stellar flight from PDX to IAH but the return was truly horrid. We hit traffic got lost and arrived with just 20 minutes to departure but boarding passes and baggage fees receipts in hand because we knew we had to check baggage due to there extreme size and weight policies. There was no one at the counter. It turns out they close the counter 45 minutes before departure. Really? 2.5 hours later around 20 people were waiting to check in. I had to pay $100 to rebook the next day and get a hotel.,2frontier-airlines,20/10/13,Frontier airlines was the 2nd part of our journey to our vacation in Seattle to be honest our first flight was with AA and that was horrible. The crew on AA nothing memorable but Frontier staff were so pleasant. I made sure when booking our flights that the connecting flights were at least 2hrs apart the service on Frontier was great and I will definitely fly with them again but this time we'll upgrade to more leg room. My Husband and I were quite happy and will use this airline again whenever we can.,10frontier-airlines,20/10/13,The customer service on Frontier is lacking. On a recent trip from Chicago to Denver changing planes then Denver to SLC I was frustrated by the lack of compassion by the Frontier staff. My daughter has MS and uses forearm crutches. Because we booked on a third party site the attendant assigned us a seat on the back row of the plane. It was very difficult for my daughter to navigate her way to the back of the plane. From Denver to SLC I asked the gate attendant if my daughter could please get a seat with more leg room closer to the front of the plane. He said they had a seat with more leg room on row 2 however it would cost an additional $15 for each of the three seats we needed. I did not think someone who is disabled should have to pay to be accommodated. While we were waiting to board the plane he announced several times that there was seating with additional leg room available for $5 or $15 depending on your type of ticket. In the end the seats with additional legroom were empty and my daughter had to go to the back row of the plane. Another frustration was we had to pay $85 to check our baggage because our third party ticket did not allow for carry-on luggage. Then there was the tackiness of having to pay for a soft drink and snacks again because we purchased our ticket through a third party. If you're going to treat customers poorly because they booked their ticket through a third party then don't offer tickets through third parties like Jet Blue does. All of their nickel and dime policies make me want to spend my dollars traveling with another airline.,frontier-airlines,16/10/13,My niece and her new husband were flying last Sunday 10/6 from SLC to Denver and on to Cancun. They arrived at the ticket counter at 6.45 am for a 7.25 flight to Denver. Frontier has a policy that you have to check in at the ticket counter 45 minutes before your flight. No where on the printed ticket did it say that. When they arrived the person at the ticket counter told them they were 5 minutes late so they would not let them check a bag or go through security. There were 6 other people in the same boat. When someone finally came back to the ticket counter 45 minutes later they charged an extra $200 and were told to come back tomorrow. Frontier went out of their way to make sure people didn't get on their flight. We will never fly Frontier.,frontier-airlines,16/10/13,KC to Denver- my flight was due to leave at 8.30 am. At 9.00 it was announced that the flight was delayed and more announcements would follow. Announcement at 9.30 am the flight will be at 10.30. At 10.30 it was announced that at 1.00 it would be announced if the flight would be cancelled or rescheduled for later that day. Also was told to be thinking about booking a different flight just in case. I went to the ticket counter and asked about a different flight. I was given a flight to Chicago on a different airline and would catch a flight from there to Denver. I went to the gate of the different airline and noticed that I landed in O'Hare but flew out of Midway. I asked the person at the gate about it. He checked it and said to return to the ticket counter. By that time the line was very long and only 1 person was handling that canceled flight. 4 hours later I got to the counter. I had to stay the night and flew to Dallas to catch a flight to Denver from there. I lost 2 days of work extra parking fees.Told they would send me a $75 voucher. They can not pay me to fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,15/10/13,I booked a flight from Org City to Bismarck ND on Sept 13 2013. We were 1 hour 40 min late leaving. Told we would keep same plane to go into Bismarck because the other plane had already left since we were late. When we arrived at Denver we were told that this plane was needed elsewhere and to go to the service desk. Waited in line for 2 hours got to a rep and was told that they did not have another flight to Bismarck until Monday. Told they would fly us to Fargo or Willison the next day and we could rent a car and go to Bismarck. They said we could see if United could get us in the next day for $500 one way but United did not honor them. I booked United I had a boot on my leg since I had fractured my foot and could not drive easily. When I called Frontier Customer services upon returning from my flight I was told that it was the weather. This is the worst airline I have flown.,frontier-airlines,15/10/13,August 8 2013 Salt Lake City to Denver Denver to Wilmington return. Frontier Airlines are unfriendly and crowded. They treated us like cattle as we were preparing to board. Do we have to expect rudeness and poor service to get a decent deal? How much can it cost to give us a small glass of orange juice? I wondered if this is just the way airline travel has become but my husband flew on Delta last week and was treated much better and enjoyed his juice. My sister flew on Southwest and even had a bag checked for free. I hope I never have to fly on Frontier again. If you had a spot for zero stars below rating travel experience I would rate zero stars. Frontier is definitely the worst in my experience.,1frontier-airlines,10/10/13,"I will never fly Frontier Airlines again. I booked a ticket from St Louis to Phoenix. I started off in St. Louis and connected through Denver to arrive in Phoenix. While in St. Louis I checked one bag for $25. I then paid an additional $45 to have ""More Legroom Seating."" and Zone 1 boarding. St. Louis leg was fine. Denver is where the issues take place. As I boarded in Zone 1 I was asked to step aside and stand in a line as the flight attendant needed to speak to me. I was informed that I needed to pay an additional $100 to carry my purse and computer bag onto this plane before I could get on my flight home. I explained to the flight attendants that I would have easily packed my computer into my existing bag that I checked in St. Louis. The flight attendant asked me to dump my purse into my computer bag. It was never mentioned to me in St. Louis that I may have to absorb an additional cost to carry my purse and computer bag onto plane. Beware of the lower priced fares of Frontier. They will charge you in the beginning middle and end! You could fly first class on other airlines.",frontier-airlines,10/10/13,"We flew from Costa Rica to ATL stayed for 7 days then back to SFO. We were told we get one free baggage per person. I confirmed again a day before. At the check-in we had to pay for baggage simply because we had stayed 7 days in ATL so it is not considered international flight. Gate check-in was a joke. She grabbed our printed boarding pass and left us nothing to show our seat number. When we asked her she said 'You did not print 2 copies?"". Really? I need to print 2 copies of boarding pass per person? Next the safety announcement at flight 429 on 10/9/2013 sounds like someone is forcing a 15 year old to read an English essay. I highly recommend travellers avoid this airline if you can.",1frontier-airlines,10/10/13,I was given this trip the purpose was to see a concert in Seattle and we were scheduled to arrive at 2 pm. Due to a weather delay our initial flight out of KC was delayed-this is not Frontier's fault. I asked the ticket counter clerk if I needed to be put on a later flight and that I was even willing to purchase a flight on another airline because I had to be in Seattle before 8 pm. The counter clerk told me this delay would cause a 'ripple' effect and that my flight out of Denver would be delayed. The flight out of Denver wasn't delayed and we missed it - and missed out on all of the flights that we could have booked when we were in KC. The only available flight was on a partner airline and arrived to Seattle at 11.15 because it had to go through Phoenix first. On the way back our flight was delayed again - this time it was not weather and we were automatically put on a later flight out of Denver to KC. This meant that we had to start our drive home 3 hours later than originally planned. Somehow we made it to Denver before our original flight left. They wouldn't let us on the plane. The ticket counter told me I had to change my ticket at customer service. Customer service called the ticket counter who told them we could not board the plane - that plane was actually delayed until 7.45. We sat and watched the plane we had purchased tickets for take off. I am giving them low ratings on everything because the seat comfort really doesn't matter when they can't do the basic job of getting you to one place when they say they will.,frontier-airlines,07/10/13,Left on Friday 10/4 at 6.15 am. First time flyer on Frontier. The ticket desk was horrible. They were so rude to each customer that went up to the ticket desk. It became the joke of the customers in line and than on flight. They acted as if we should be lucky they were there instead of treating us as the customers. Flight attendants were abrupt and never helpful or kind. Awful experience. When I got to my destination I talked with my son and his fiancee who flew the day before. Same thing happened to them. On the way home from Oklahoma City on 10/7 we had an amazing experience. My ratings below are on MPLS only.,frontier-airlines,07/10/13,"I booked the flight via a 3rd party agent depart from Los Angeles to Indianapolis with one carry-on with me for the weekend. Arrived at LAX 20 minutes before departure. Incredibly I avoided the extremely long line and made it through the kiosk quickly but did not realize that they charge $25 carry-on fee for 3rd party booking users. So I got charged $100 at the terminal gate in order to board the flight instead of $25. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to bad weather in their hub in Denver. On the returning flight I arrived at the Frontier counter in Indianapolis 50 minutes before departure. Few people in front of me and a few behind me at the counter with only 2 employees working there with extra slow pace. By the time I reach the counter I been told that their counter has been shut down 45 minutes prior to the departure as well as the Kiosk so there is no way for me to pass TSA without a boarding pass. Their employees were extremely rude with a bad attitude. Both left the counter and shut down everything. All they said was ""read the sign and call the 1-800 numbers for help. I called the number but ended up wasting my time. It was $100 to reschedule which I did not accept. In the end I had to purchase a one- way flight from Delta across the lobby for $450.90 in order for me to get back to Los Angeles on Sunday. I have learned some lessons from this incident which I will definitely avoid Frontier Airline in my life.",frontier-airlines,07/10/13,My family booked its trip on Frontier Airlines through Travelocity. From the time of booking to when we flew several changes were made that negatively impacted our trip greatly. We were not notified that because we had an economy ticket our carry-on bag would be $50 a bag to take on the plane along with no food or beverage except water. Also Frontier Airlines has implemented a new policy that if your boarding pass is not checked in 45 minutes prior to your flight you are not allowed on the plane and are to be rebooked. My family was traveling in a very small airport turned in our rental car and got in line about 50 minutes before the flight. Please note that there is no one in the security line and that it would take about 10 minutes to check in and go through security at this airport. As we are standing in line it is announced that my family along with 15 others will not be allowed on the plane and that we will need to rebook. Because it is a small airport the soonest that Frontier Airlines could get us to our destination was 2.5 days later. My family rented a car drove to another airport 7 hours away paid for new tickets on another airline and got home late that evening. Frontier Airlines is known as an airline for value however booking with them cost my family an additional $1200 and left many of their patrons sitting in the airport stranded. My family along with many extended members will never fly Frontier again and we will make sure to share this experience with as many people as possible. For a customer service industry this is unacceptable.,frontier-airlines,26/09/13,My wife and I were scheduled to go to Los Angeles to visit our family today. Arrived at Frontier in Bismarck ND an hour before the flight (at 5.30am). Bismarck is a tiny airport and the last time I attempted to get there 2 hours prior to departure no one was there. When we arrived there was a large line at Frontier we waited for 20+ minutes and the lady at the check in stated that Denver (Frontier's hub) had shut down their computers and nobody else would be able to check in. The entire line missed their flight. This was due to the fact they opened the check in line later than they should have. They did not shut down the check in line 45 mins prior to the flight departing because they were trying to catch up from a combination of opening up so late and the incredibly slow service. Not only were there no other flights that day the flight for the next day was full and we were told Saturday was the first option. You would also think this would be at no additional charge you would be wrong to think that as well. They charge you transfer fees third party booking fees difference in the cost of the new ticket etc... So all in all we initially paid $635 for the tickets for the two of us then I paid $679 to put my wife on a Delta flight same day to get her to LA lastly I paid $399 for myself to fly from Dickinson to LA on Friday morning. Frontier gave me a credit for the flight I missed that ended up being worth $33. That doesn't even cover the gas for me to drive back from Bismarck after they caused me to miss my flight.,frontier-airlines,24/09/13,I arrived at the gate with 40 minutes until departure. They would not give me a boarding pass! Additionally the rude lady at the counter would not re-book me or put me on standby for another flight. I had to buy new same day tickets with Southwest Airlines. Worst of all because I didn't make my outgoing flight they cancelled my return flight.,frontier-airlines,22/09/13,September 20th - first flight: ABQ to Denver and Flight 2 Denver to Seattle WA. Both flights were delayed. The boarding process was chaotic the boarding by zones served no purpose: we had to wait in line before boarding for at least half hour because passengers struggled to find a spot to store their carryon luggage and struggling to get to their seats causing heavy traffic in the aisle. Attendants seemed to be as confused as us not knowing what to do. I and other passengers had to check in their carryon as all the overhead compartments were full. The check- in agent did not seem to know what to do either. Finally arriving in Denver I headed to the customer service to make sure my carry-on would get to my final destination when I arrived at the counter the three employees who were not helping anyone literally ignored me for some time and then finally a rude employee did not really help me out but sent me to another gate in order to receive service. Second flight was delayed due to refuel process. Paying for entertainment may be justified but paying for non alcoholic beverages is not acceptable. I will definitely not fly with this airline ever again.,1frontier-airlines,19/09/13,"We booked through Cheapo Air because tickets were cheaper. Well we made up for this at the airport when we checked our bags - $25 for checked bag and $20 for carry on - each. We followed online instructions that said it would be cheaper if we checked in online - so we did. I used my smartphone so could not print a boarding pass. At the completion of this online check in I got the message ""online check-in confirmed"" - this was witnessed by four other people. At the airport we were told that they had no record of our online check-in so had to pay $50 for checked bag and $25 for our carry-on. Not only that but the 3 of us did not get seats together. We had to approach the ticket counter every stop (4 times) and beg to get our seats changed so we could sit together. On two ""legs"" of our trip we got the very back row which was stuffy/hot/uncomfortable. If you have booked your flights together they should know that you want to sit together. It's ridiculous! It all comes down to booking with them so you will pay a higher fee for your ticket. One ""leg"" of our trip the flight was delayed almost one hour with no explanation no notification no apology. We would never fly Frontier again.",frontier-airlines,16/09/13,9/13/2013 Flights: 231 Nashville to Denver 551 Denver to San Diego 563 Denver to San Diego. Travelers beware. Frontier is no longer what it once was. The ticket gate and customer service agents will - either through incompetence or deliberate false manipulation - frustrate your efforts to smooth out the hiccups caused by their poor schedule management. Flight delays and missed connections are tough luck - takes 12 hours to travel Nashville to San Diego or Chicago to Las Vegas or Austin to Denver. There were 100s of these stories just in one day. The staff denied that connections would be missed (they were) claimed all flights were delayed (they weren't) claimed later flights were full (not true). New militant carry on baggage measurements and charges don't ask for water coffee or a soda unless you have your credit card handy and don't count on them having anything edible on board. If you still decide to travel with this miserable airline the best of luck.,frontier-airlines,15/09/13,I flew Frontier approx 2 years ago to Vegas and had a bad experience then. I ignorantly decided to give them another try and flew to San Diego from Nashville with a layover in Denver same route back to Nashville. Not only was the check in staff rude but they messed up our seat assignments. My husband and I who were on our honeymoon checked in 2 hours early and they still managed to mess up our seat arrangements made during the booking process 4 months prior. We ended up having to fly seated separately. Normally we wouldn't be too upset but it was our honeymoon and we did check in with adequate time and booked our flights well in advance. Needless to say I will never use this airline again.,frontier-airlines,13/09/13,I got an early flight from IND to PDX. Flight 613 was 2+ hours late so Frontier rebooked to later flight with 20 minute connection in DEN which was obviously missed. Rebooked again on Alaska Air to SFO then Virgin Air to PDX later that night. After traveling over 12 hours now my bags are in SEA waiting for next flight to PDX so I have to wait hours again! Bags never made flight! Drove to SEA airport to pick them up. Trip home 2 weeks later flight 792 from PDX on time only to find out in DEN that flight is actually delayed but not before running 40 gates to make a connection then running 40 gates back to new gate. All airport displays showing on time at wrong gate! Now sitting at new gate waiting hours again. Flight 1608 finally leaves well after 4.30 with a reserve pilot. Not once did we get to watch TV on any one segment of flight to or from PDX! I will look for other airlines in the future.,1frontier-airlines,11/09/13,We recently flew to and from Denver to Anchorage. Both were night flights. Your cabin and reading lights are awful. Those greyish/white lights make the plane feel like a parking garage and impossible to read by. Yes everyone is transitioning to new types of lighting but there are better lighting options out there.,4frontier-airlines,08/09/13,Our flight ILG-MDW was wonderful. Wilmington airport was a breeze flight was pleasant arrived 30 minutes early. We upgraded to STRETCH seating which was very comfortable. Flight crew was extremely friendly and personable. I look forward to flying them in the future.,10frontier-airlines,08/09/13,Flew late July from Vegas to Cancun via Denver. Realised that bags had not been booked apparently you can not do this from UK. I attempted to book online day before leaving Vegas but was not permitted to do this. At airport we paid for bags and asked to have two seats together as my partner is a very nervous flyer. Check-in staff in Denver were lovely and quickly changed our seats. Staff on flights were probably the worst I have flown. Landing announcements were quite funny and instead of reminding passengers to check the overhead compartments for personal belongings we may have stored she said to check for any personal problems we may have left there. Didn't flying used to be fun and exciting and not a chore.,3frontier-airlines,05/09/13,Orlando to Trenton on 8/28 and return 9/3/13. I had one of the best flights I've had! I was bothered about the reviews I read prior to my flight and I can testify that my Frontier flight was flawless. It on time crew and staff couldn't have been more professional and courteous. I look forward to flying into Trenton NJ again.,10frontier-airlines,03/09/13,August 23rd on Flight 572 from Salt Lake City to Denver and on Flight 156 to Des Moines. Return flight on August 27th on Flight 157 from Des Moines to Denver and on Flight 575 to Salt Lake City. I have flown Frontier several times within the past four or five years and have never experienced difficulty. However on this flight I was shocked by the apparent focus of the staff on measuring each person's carry on bags. I saw several customers being sent back to the security desk to pay a $50 fee so that they could carry on a backpack - simply because the backpack did not fit in the measuring tool. Each item individuals had to pay extra for were not overweight nor extremely large. Many of them had backpacks the same size as mine and my backpack fit completely under the seat with no problem. Personally I had to remove my dirty laundry out of the front compartment of my suitcase and transfer it to my checked on bag or I would have had to pay an extra $50 to check on my carry on bag. I believe Frontier has changed their focus from convenience and friendliness to customers and are now focused on making more money. I remember the days when Frontier used to serve complementary drinks and cookies on their flights. Now they charge $2 for a glass of apple juice. Forget the cookies. I will not be using this airline again in the near future.,2frontier-airlines,29/08/13,DEN-SLC. Not for the business traveler. In a competitive industry - you would think that the airline would want last minute top dollar customers. Finished meeting early have 4.30 flight but not able to take the 1.55 - would not accept me as standby because I am not their rewards customer. Frontier does not fly anywhere that would warrant being a rewards member. Also the entire cabin was laughing because of the flight attendants trance to ensure that everyone was charged for their carry on luggage.,frontier-airlines,27/08/13,Arrived at 5am to Salt Lake City Airport to find my flight cancelled. Nobody had received any type of alert. After 1 hr 15 mins we were finally addressed by a Frontier Airlines employee who was passing out customer service cards and telling us that we would likely have better results by calling or rebooking. I called finding a 45 minute wait should be expected. Like many customers I was on a tight schedule and decided to book with Southwest Airlines. My Southwest flights were excellent. On the returning trip the first flight was 45 minutes late. We had a similar wait on my connecting flight though we were told repeatedly that there would be a delay of some sort with no explanation or expected time which ended up lasting at least an half hour. I understand that things like this happen but I was happy to land in my final destination.,frontier-airlines,27/08/13,I have traveled with this airline several times in the past year from Utah to Arkansas and have never encountered any problems. The last trip was SLC to LR. Once onboard the plane proceeded to the runway where there was a 45 minute delay. Had to return to the gate told we had a choice to deplane or stay but all connecting flights would be missed in DEN. We boarded again and went to DEN. Staff were amusing and more than willing to offer any information. We all received our hotel accommodation food vouchers and questions were answered quickly and efficiently. The next day was a piece of cake - I flew on to SLC but had problems with losing my bag but had it delivered to my home by 5am the next morning. One thing I didn't understand was the first flight they gave a free beverage but the one from DEN to SLC they wanted to charge for a soda. I feel like a beverage is a very small request for the price of an airline ticket.,5frontier-airlines,26/08/13,I purchased the tickets in February to fly Classic Plus in April and return in May. When I scheduled this round trip ticket the airline stated I would receive free television on both flights along with discounted liquor. On the first flight I did and the service was great. On the flight back I was informed Frontier no longer provided such service and canceled in between the time of my three week business trip. Had it not have been for the TV baggage fees reduced and beverages I would have chosen I different airline. They either need to inform prior to flying as the company knew I had the ticket so I could get a different company or honor their' commitment when I paid for the ticket.,1frontier-airlines,26/08/13,I have to say my round trip went without a hitch. Both my departure and return flight were on time with no mechanical problems. The staff were cordial and my seat was the same as any other airline as far as comfort. Yes they do charge for drinks and snacks so if that bothers you buy your own in the airport (it is the same price anyway). I flew from Delaware to Houston and it cost 110 dollars. All other airlines that had direct flights were asking between 350-400 dollars. For that price difference I am willing to shell out 5 dollars for a snack and something to drink. Maybe I had beginners luck but I did save quite a bit of money.,7frontier-airlines,26/08/13,Began flying Frontier out of Williston ND some 3 years ago since they were the only carrier there. I live in Utah so would have expected basic but acceptable service. It seems the longer I continue flying with them the more the problems. Coming home to Utah this last time meant delay after delay (I had some 5 delay announcements sent to my email all after I already knew about it!) causing me to miss my connection at Denver. Almost had to stay overnight. Had been gone from home 3 months! How difficult is it to maintain their equipment? Always an issue for them. Now United and Delta are flying to North Dakota. I have to return with Frontier but won't fly them again. I'd rather fly someone else for $100 more who has their act together without the drama and adventure. Hope they go out of business soon.,frontier-airlines,20/08/13,SEA-DEN-ILG (Wilmington DE) one way. A pleasant enough way to travel. Had exit row seats on both legs at $20 per segment on an economy fare this is a steal and well worth it. Yes you do have to pay for drinks but they will give you a cup of water for free if you ask. Why not just charge an extra $2/ticket and give everyone a free drink and a small snack? Flight from DEN delayed 35 minutes due to waiting on a crew member to deadhead. Carry on bag policy enforced at DEN with all bags sized but not SEA - if an airline wants to be strict they should do it at every airport. Some people were bringing bags on the Seattle flight that were clearly over-sized. Wilmington New Castle airport is a great alternative to chaotic PHL but has little to no room for expansion and is crowded with just one flight on the ground.,8frontier-airlines,11/08/13,"LAX-DEN. Bought a ticket after 20 hour flight from Asia since it was a better connection to DEN. Flight delayed 1.5 hours and had to rebook everyone making a connection - 2 agents for 70 people who were totally incompetent could not get anything done. No announcements no information just rude attitude from ground staff. My bags were checked through onto Frontier and I checked with agent to make sure they would get loaded on from the international flight after clearing customs in LAX - she assured me ""no problem"" and of course on arrival - no bag. Had to wait 36 hours before they were delivered. Never again.",2frontier-airlines,11/08/13,"My son and I flew from ANC to SFO (and return) via DEN. Satisfied by all flights and crew. However I did notice some changes since my last flight(s) one being the new charges for carryons. The folks at SFO began to implement this new policy and it caused quite a bit of confusion for the passengers and some noted unhappiness at having to pay. Some folks were not pleased with having to have their stuff ""sized up"" prior to boarding. The new policy of charging for all drinks was not too popular as well. I spoke with a couple of crew members from the various flights we were on and a basic theme appeared ""we seem to be heading towards becoming Spirit"". Crew members were not too thrilled. I was using my miles on this trip and my last one with my daughter recently. I have been both an Ascent and Summit member for years and have been very pleased with Frontier. I am however somewhat scared about their becoming a bottom feeder. I know change is always around the corner with airlines but the nickel and dimes they are going after is not right in my way of thinking. Keep it up and I will be traveling on Alaska Air year round.",7frontier-airlines,06/08/13,My daughter took a teaching job in Phoenix we drove from Michigan to help her get settled. Tried to use Frontier to get back to Michigan - worst experience ever! My husband was to fly out on Sunday the 28th at 3.14 to Denver after several hours was sent to O'Hare had to stay overnight get up at 5.00 to get flight to Grand Rapids Michigan. I stayed until Saturday 3rd 3.14 flight after a delay got on the plane sat for half an hour got off the plane. 2 hour delay - stood in line to change connecting flight Denver to Grand Rapids. Line up to board plane - cancelled. Back to the line for new connecting flight. 9.00pm all flights to Denver cancelled. Back in line. Phoenix to Miami at 10.40. Miami to O'Hare at 6.40 am. Now I need to be picked up in Chicago. Terrible experience.,frontier-airlines,05/08/13,First and last Frontier trip SFO to/from Denver. 1.5 hour delay out of SFO. Nearly 3 hour delay out of Denver - 2am arrival! Had to get a taxi home at 3am. Should have flown more expensive flight on another airline. Never again.,frontier-airlines,04/08/13,Had a 2.5hr delay on the first flight (no apologies or service recovery offered) and another 2hr delay on the return flight because they used the same mechanically inept plane. The return flight was to be the first of the day. An entire plane of peoples plans ruined.,frontier-airlines,28/07/13,"Flew from DTW to Denver (connecting flight to SNA) traveling with two small children (3 years old and 9) they offered us a ""complementary soda"" nothing else! On the way back to DTW a week later we checked in 2 hours early and they sat us all including my 3 year old child all by him self the representative at the ticket counter simply said there is nothing she could do! No more complementary sodas.",1frontier-airlines,22/07/13,Daughter and I flew down to SLC from ANC changing planes in DEN. No problems going or returning with the small exception of a somewhat rude/uncaring employee at check-in at SLC. The service was fine the planes clean and the flight crews were caring and professional. The crew on the return to ANC was the best I have ever had on any airline professional and funny. I have them on the flight tonight returning to DEN as my son and I fly to SFO. I expect the flight will be a good one!,9frontier-airlines,19/07/13,DEN-SJO. Cramped in a seat with no recline. I tried to call in advance to book a seat seat assignment via website did not work. Online check-in not working. It seems that service is non-existent anymore on that airline. Attendants came shortly after take off to sell snack boxes and beverages for $2. No free water service on a 5 hour flight. Attendants very rude sat around and chatted the whole flight.,frontier-airlines,17/07/13,Seattle to Omaha 7/12/13 Flights: 510 and 432. Omaha to Seattle 7/15/13 Flights: 437 and 843. I have had many complications with this airline. The last 4 flights I was on over this past weekend did not leave on time. The shortest waiting time was 2 hours after original departure and the longest was 24 hours. I have many other opinions on why I am not satisfied with this airline and will not fly with them.,1frontier-airlines,14/07/13,I flew Denver to DC. Outbound was pleasant enough by today's flying standards. The way back was horrible. I had the same weight suitcase as when I left and they wanted to charge 75 dollars for an overweight bag but a second bag is 20 dollars. The person at the counter was very rude. They started charging for beverages on July 1st. If you add up the fees this airline charges you will actually pay less with another more expensive carrier. I'd shop around before booking tickets with Frontier.,3frontier-airlines,08/07/13,Booked MSN to DEN. Had a 13.5 hour delay one day - was able to reschedule for the next day at 6am. The delay for that flight next was 3.5 hours. Poor communication and limited options made the situation worse. Both delays were mechanical in nature.,frontier-airlines,08/07/13,Flying from Cancun Mexico to Denver. Spent 45 minutes at gate waiting for maintenance to repair a tray that wouldn't stay latched. Then another 20 minutes for a refuel. Only two updates on status in the entire hour. Missed the connecting flight. After another 4 hours we here the announcement that the Denver to SLC flight was delayed 30 minutes. Given a card with a phone number to file a complaint or a compliment. The wait times were horrendous and after waiting for 15 to 30 minutes with no answer - we tried this several times. Most recently it said high call volume. Not surprised. Hope we never have to fly Frontier airline again. Staff fairly unconcerned.,1frontier-airlines,07/07/13,Not a pleasant return flight from Denver. Flew DEN-STL on the 'economy' fare. Seats were okay but became uncomfortable and pitch was poor. Beverage service was nonexistent since drinks now cost $1.99. That is ridiculous. Flight attendants were rude. The bright side was the TV service.,3frontier-airlines,03/07/13,"There is room for improvement. Left from STL at 5.00 on time outbound to DEN. Seats weren't that great. They were thin and uncomfortable. Very little lumbar support. Flight attendants were okay a little aloof but kind. Inflight entertainment was nice but you had to pay for it. No complimentary snacks. Drinks were free but will be $1.99 as of 7/1/13 - ridiculous. Plane was somewhat dirty. Very wide plane however (A320). Seat pitch wasn't bad (I'm 5'9""). Landed ahead of schedule. Overall pleasant first experience but could have been better.",5frontier-airlines,01/07/13,Flight number 122 from Denver to Dallas on 6/30/13. Flight delayed 3 hours and I never received any notification from the airlines via email text automated call. The customer service desk was very unhelpful in exploring other flight options since the flight now doesn't leave until 11pm. They also were very unhelpful in providing any information. I will never use Frontier again this is a first and a last.,frontier-airlines,23/06/13,I once again had a great experience flying Frontier-ANC to SLC via DEN. The planes were clean the service was excellent and always on time. We actually landed in ANC 30 minutes early on the return. I have yet to have a less than positive flight ever with them. I have been flying them since they arrived in ANC many years ago. Good choice overall.,9frontier-airlines,11/06/13,Flight 929 from Trenton to Detroit yesterday. After hearing a number of bad comments I had very low expectations. They gave me an option of a food box which I liked. Had a small TV in front of my seat. Flight attendants were funny and very nice. Seats were comfortable.,10frontier-airlines,07/06/13,The worst airline I've flown. My flight got changed 7 times. Each time it was a new reason why the flight time was changed. My flight was suppose to take off at 8am. Did not leave until 9pm. The service alone was enough to make me never want to fly with the airline again.,frontier-airlines,05/06/13,"I flew from Columbus Ohio to Trenton New Jersey a few weeks ago and had a good experience. I was worried because of the unfavourable reviews but I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. Frontier is your typical ""no-frills"" airline. You do have to pay for a snack but for the price I paid for the flight I wasn't complaining about that. The position of the seats was a tad uncomfortable however my flight was short so it wasn't too much of a problem for me. The staff and flight attendants were helpful and friendly and there were no delays on either flight. In fact the return flight arrived early. In my opinion Frontier is a good value and I would fly with them again.",9frontier-airlines,02/06/13,DCA to Jackson Hole Wyoming. Flights to Denver and one to Jackson Hole were on time. New clean Airbus 319s. Friendly and helpful crew. Return flight from Jackson Hole left about 40 minutes late due to weather but they held connecting flight in Denver and arrival in DCA only 10 minutes late. Excellent experience.,10frontier-airlines,30/05/13,I foolishly accepted a great rate flight forgetting you get what you pay for. Flight delayed from LAX to Denver 3.5 hours upon arriving in Denver the staff were completely useless and preferred bad attitudes over customer service. The amount of misinformation received was nothing short of incredible. Management was useless. I will never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,29/05/13,Friday 24 May 2013. Frontiers Denver flight was delayed 3 hours which caused me to miss my connection to Reagan Airport so an agent booked me on a United flight from Denver to Dulles. While at the gate I was told I needed to check my luggage because it may not fit in the overhead bin although my carryon luggage met the requirements of a carry on. Once I arrived in Denver I was told by a United agent that they no longer have a contract with Frontier and I was unable to board the plane. So while I did not board the United flight my luggage was on its way to Dulles. I then had to stay over night in Denver and pay for my own hotel. When I finally made it back to Oklahoma I was told my bag was located and it would be sent to my house. Received a call Tuesday 28 May 2013 stating my luggage was still at Dulles with United.,frontier-airlines,27/05/13,Have no problems with Frontier except their seats. Horrible and I've flown over 60 flights with other airlines. Never had a seat that uncomfortable. The cushioning in the seats is terrible.,5frontier-airlines,20/05/13,"No huge gripe here but it just seems Frontier has joined just about every other airline in the USA in their quest for uncomfortable mediocrity. My tray tables on each of 4 flights were filthy and the seats are very hard. ""Classic Plus"" gives you a few more inches of leg room but little else. They will attempt to charge you for your complimentary beverage upgrade and nobody on that aircraft will get any freebies not even a tiny bag of pretzels. Don't expect a magazine (or even SkyMall) or any free TV/movie viewing. The in-flight credit card sales pitch is the icing on this cake of cheapskate tackiness.",5frontier-airlines,13/05/13,Flew Frontier last week and had a horrible experience. On the way back they were delayed 1 hour due to weather even though looking at a radar of the entire US there were no weather issues anywhere. Another staff member said it was an air traffic control delay where another said it was a TSA issue. They wouldn't hold our connecting flight for 5 minutes and we missed our flight. We had to wait 5 hours. Finally they lost our luggage and I still don't have it back. I have yet to receive a phone call. It has now been 4 days since the flight.,frontier-airlines,13/05/13,The planes were clean and the staff very nice. What I didn't like was they push for you to sign up for a Frontier Airlines Mastercard. They should be pushing you to get one of their cards in the Concourse / Gate Area that seems more comfortable to me than having the Flight Attendants doing it. The live TV service has gone up in price didn't like that - they should have left the price alone.,10frontier-airlines,13/05/13,New Orleans to Denver: heavy rain flight delayed. Staff tell us we won't make our connection so should go back pay for our own hotel and try again tomorrow. We insist that we go to Denver now they reluctantly concede but take us off the connection flight giving us tickets for next day. We should have insisted that we get the boarding passes for the connection and then change those if we can't make it. Before departing we call our travel agency who tell us that there is a United flight with seats departing the same day and Frontier was responsible for placing us on that. Onboard: staff start asking me where I'm going then essentially grab my carry-on bag out of my hand to check it in. I explain that due to my short connection my bag will almost certainly not make it and ask to check for a space. They say no. I was shocked by their abruptness and rudeness. In Denver: our connection is delayed and is boarding as we leave the plane. They won't let us on. After a phone call staff at the gate decide to let us on. In Seattle: naturally they didn't get my bag there on time. I had to get it myself the next day.,frontier-airlines,13/05/13,I've got no problem with the on-the-ground staff of Frontier. Most are hardworking nice folks but I may never fly Frontier ever again due to their poor management making decisions. Thr overhead compartments wouldn't be extremely full if they didn't start charging to put bags under the plane years ago. Now they will charge us to have a carry-on bag for our own good of course. Also promo codes that their site say they are good for a certain time they don't last until the time they say they are usable. That's just dishonest. All things considered it's enough to push me away from ever wanting to fly them again. I'm happy to take my business elsewhere especially when other companies fares are identical. Why fly a dishonest airline that talks down to their customers?,1frontier-airlines,10/05/13,I will never fly frontier again Trenton Airport customer service is horrible and they don't have someone to take your baggage down to security for you when you have an infant a child to tend to and I also had my 90 year old grandmother with me who was in a wheelchair. When it was time to board the airplane they didn't have the walk way connected to the plane. They had to push my grandmother up on the ramp. We got to the door of the airplane they had my grandmother sitting in the middle seat they had to change her seat 3 or 4 times. We just wanted to go to Orlando FL with my children but I will go to the Philadelphia Airport and get on United to make our next trip.,frontier-airlines,06/05/13,TTN-TPA round-trip. Booked 1 week in advance and paid under $200 round-trip whereas US Airways and Southwest's fares were twice as much. Overall good value for money. In addition to the savings on airfare I was able to park for free at the Trenton airport. Since the flights were full we were given the opportunity to gate check our carry-ons and pick them up at baggage claim. This came in handy flying from TTN to TPA since I wouldn't have to carry my garment bag through the Tampa airport. But I would advise don't gate check carry-ons when flying into a small airport like Trenton. I had to wait in a cramped baggage claim for probably 30 minutes for my bag no thanks to the ground crew taking their sweet time. As much as I don't like the Philadelphia airport at least bags are going around the carousel by the time I get to baggage claim. Also although Frontier has DirecTV on the seat backs if you get the lowest fare you have to pay extra for it. And if you're thinking about purchasing snacks you better have a credit or debit card because they don't accept cash.,7frontier-airlines,05/05/13,"We had purchased 2 return tickets MDT (Harrisburg) to MCO (Orlando). Did online check-in 24 hr prior to takeoff at which time we purchased and paid for Frontier's Stretch seating. Selected a middle for myself and window for son who is over 6 ft tall. They called our name and boarded us first before all other passengers. My extra charge stretch seat became awful when Frontier determined the seat (aisle) next to me was the only place that would accommodate a ""double wide"" passenger. Their term not mine. They wheeled the passenger in and we spent 2 hours skin to skin with me unable to move. There would have been absolutely no way to access the screen controls. We also were unable to get out for bathroom use or for any other reason. I understand we all have different body types and sizes but it's unfair for me to pay extra for more room yet getting the worst possible seat on the plane. I will never pay for ""stretch"" seating on Frontier I won't be flying with them again.",frontier-airlines,04/05/13,This is the worst airline ever. Only use them if you are desperate and if you are plan to have a terrible experience. I have taken hundreds of flights good and bad and Frontier is one I will never take again. I've only used them three times but each time they have been delayed. I mean 20 minute delay fine but each flight has been delayed over an hour and usually close to two. One was weather related and okay of course that happens but other times there has been no excuse. And when I have talked to them on the phone they give no information for why its delayed! I've only taken this airline because it flies into an airport right by my parents so its easier when I go to visit them but Id much rather fly to Newark or JFK and take a train to my family! Lesson finally learned. But really Frontier get your stuff together.,2frontier-airlines,01/05/13,Our flight was changed to us air. Me and my wife 2 children 1 being an infant had seating together and select seating. We were moved to another flight seated apart when there was an entire row above us for same price open. We were denied be able to have those seats and sit together. I had asked for a reason and none was given. I asked to speak to the air manager. What kind of business downgrades their customers to a worse seating arrangement when its the companies problem they had to move our flight? We also had to pay the baggage fee difference. Customer service was horrible I will have to say I would never book a flight with Frontier Airlines again and would gladly pay more to another airline that would accommodate their customers.,2frontier-airlines,22/04/13,This airline could not provide a flight-crew for a flight from Kansas City to Boston so the flight was cancelled. We were then transferred to a flight to LaGuardia. We got to LaGuardia and had to switch terminals to the flight which was a US Airways flight with the rest of the people from our original flight. We got to the terminal and the flight had left and all other services to Boston had finished. We were told to go the baggage claim and take a bus to a hotel. Our bags had made it on the US Airways flight. We could not find the bus due to terrible communication skills between the passengers and the staff. However one very nice flight attendant on the flight to New York stepped outside the job description and helped passengers personally.,2frontier-airlines,16/04/13,We were pleased with our flight from Chicago to Denver and Denver to Las Vegas. I wish they had told us ahead of time that the seats in front of the emergency door don't recline. Our son has to have a reclining seat and we were not told about this prior to purchasing our tickets.,9frontier-airlines,16/04/13,LaGuardia-Denver-Phoenix. Incoming plane to LGA was delayed for mechanical reasons. Plane to DEN therefore left the gate 2 hours late. Sat on the Tarmac another hour and a half because of a fast moving storm. We all missed our flights out of DEN. Frontier denied responsibility for the delay secondary to the weather. Clearly if the incoming plane to LGA had been on time we would have left ahead of the storm and made it to our destination. I waited in line in Denver for an hour and a half to speak with the customer service agent who gave me incorrect information. I was finally booked on a flight leaving early the next morning to San Diego way out of my way with a transfer to PHX. Spent a sleepless night in Denver airport and got home 24 hours after the start of my journey.,2frontier-airlines,16/04/13,Trenton to Orlando. I flew with my husband and my 2 young boys. Check in took a little while because there was only 2 girls at the counter. Security check did not take long but was thorough. The plane was on the smaller side but not any smaller than Spirit Airlines planes. The seats are a little smaller than your Continental airline seats. If you are a larger person and don't like tight spaces don't fly Frontier or Spirit airlines. Flight out was on time some turbulence mostly smooth. Flight back was about an hour behind but made up some time in the air. The attendants were nice. Cleanliness as average. I found some trash in the pocket seat in front of me. We had no problems with Frontier.,8frontier-airlines,03/04/13,Denver to Spokane (March '13). We were put in the back seats that don't recline at all. The space to the seat in front of us was so close to us that ii even blocked our reading light. The stewardesses were sympathetic but apparently couldn't offer us the empty 'stretch' seats unless we paid an extra 25 dollars. The stewardess said the 'stretch seats' had actually created the lack of leg room between other seats. Frontier should not have back seats that are so cramped and certainly shouldn't be charging full price for them. While giving the usual free beverages we found it very cheap and tacky that Frontier doesn't even give a bag of pretzels. To have to pay for even music channels is very poor for customer relations.,2frontier-airlines,25/03/13,Booked a flight from MSP to DEN saved maybe 20 bucks on the flight. Started to taxi down the runway there was a problem where they told us they need to run tests that will take 45 minutes. 2 hours later they removed us from the plane. 3 more hours of unknown and no communication. Finally they routed a plane from another location and I touched down at 1.15 (2.15 local). Then it came time to come home my 3pm flight turned into the same thing this time we never boarded though. I waited in the DEN airport for mechanical issues until we were boarded at 8.15. I spent over 10 hours in one weekend waiting for Frontier Airlines. I have $300 in useless vouchers from one weekend - you could not pay me to fly with them again.,frontier-airlines,22/03/13,I have flown Frontier twice in the last month. Both times the flight was delayed until it was later cancelled. The agents were very difficult to work with and did not provide reasonable accommodations. On the first flight I had to purchase a Delta flight or wait 2 to 3 days to get to my destination with no weather issues at the origin or destination airport. Today a Thursday I was turned away in Minneapolis and told they could not get me to a wedding in San Diego by Saturday. Given no alternatives in either case. Neither was acceptable and I will not fly this carrier again.,frontier-airlines,19/03/13,My outbound flights were both on time and I really have no complaints other than both planes smelt. My return was delayed and after asking to be rebooked the gate agent said everyone was going to make connecting flight. She was incredibly rude and did not want to help anyone. After missing my flight which I knew was going to happen it took over an hour to rebook me and half my flight missed connections. Frontier could not get me into OMA within the next 24 hours so I drove. I would never recommend flying Frontier.,frontier-airlines,19/03/13,Have flown Frontier 3 times now each time seems to be a little worse. Just got back from a Florida trip via Harrisburg PA. Going down there was a problem with a seat late leaving. Coming back same problem sat onboard for one hour waiting for a seat to be fixed. My tickets were bought 3 months in advance and they were high in price one month before the flight they were 1/2 the price. So buying early isn't always the best way to go. Wanted to buy a snack they were out so made another choice they were out - this was the first flight of the day. Cheaper isn't always better.,5frontier-airlines,06/03/13,I checked in online the night before but did not have my boarding pass. I also was not checking any bags. I made it to the ticketing/baggage check counter right at 45 minutes before the flight time. I was told that I could not check in. Rather than wait in line I remembered seeing signs that you could get through security using your smart phone. I verified this with the agent before I went through security. Unfortunately I only had the pdf document downloaded to my phone and that was not sufficient. I needed to have the little speciality square that these smart phones can read. I had to return to ticketing to change my flight because I was definitely going to miss the flight. Then I had to fly standby and hope I could get on a later flight. So my lack of knowledge regarding the scanning/smart phone procedures did me in but it all started when the first agent gave me bad information. The agent that finally provided me with a boarding pass verified that the 1st agent should have been able to issue the boarding pass - it was only checking in at that point that required her. In hindsight I should have argued with the 1st agent or requested that he check with someone more experienced (or who was listening to me).,2frontier-airlines,04/03/13,We traveled recently on a trip that was American Airlines to our destination but Frontier on our return. I have no complaints about the flight itself. We were delayed due to necessary de-icing but the captain and flight attendants kept us informed and we were grateful to arrive at our final destination only a couple hours late. My only complaint would be that they don't know how to seat people we were in a group of 4 (2 couples) and they seated us all over the plane in middle seats between people who were traveling alone. We weren't allowed to pick our seats or change them so that even couples could sit together. I just feel that if you book your trip early enough as we did there should be no excuse for such a terrible job of seating us.,7frontier-airlines,20/02/13,Booked our trip in Sep and paid for preferred seating. When we checked in at the ticket counter we were told that our seats that we prepaid for we're reserved for other customers and we were given seats further back. On the flight the seats we had paid for sat empty. While onboard I turned on my light to get a drink and the attendant said I would have to wait while she and another attendant stood in the front and had their drinks and snacks an hour later she came by and wanted to know if we wanted anything. Would not waste my money on such poor service.,1frontier-airlines,18/02/13,Return round-trip from Ft. Lauderdale to Trenton-Mercer NJ airport was a disaster. We had a return flight for Monday 2/10/13 at 6.40pm - they delayed the flight to 8.50pm then to 11.30pm then at 12.30am cancelled flight. They advised that they could book us on a flight back Friday - 5 days later! The flight Wednesday was fully booked. We asked that that they put us on another airline on Tuesday but they would only refund our fare. It ended up costing us double since we had to get one way tickets at the last minute on another airline. We had to fly into Newark airport and then arrange transportation back to our car in Trenton. We will never fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,18/02/13,All flights departed on time and either landed early or on time. The second flight DEN to IND was the best of all - one flight attendant knew my son loved the Frontier animals so he looked for some cards with the animals listed. He gave the whole family free headphones to watch TV for the rest of the flight. If the need arises to travel to DEN again I will definitely choose Frontier Airlines.,10frontier-airlines,12/02/13,Kansas City-Denver-Colorado Springs return 1-30-13 return 2-4-13. No problems on first leg but flight from Den to COS was late nearly 2 hours as originating flight from Minot ND was delayed due to mechanical. Return flight COS flight pushed back and stayed on tarmac for 30 minutes as one engine could not be started. Eventually corrected and just barely made connecting flight to MCI. Again no problems on the Denver to Kansas City flight.,5frontier-airlines,31/01/13,My daughter and I flew from Newport News to Denver and on to LAX on Jan 25 2013. Although both flights were enjoyable the first leg was particularly well managed by the flight crew. One of the passengers a lady with a small child 15 months old was doing an admirable job of keeping the little girl happy. On a 4.5 hour flight this is a nearly impossible task. After serving drinks an FA spent a good deal of time occupying the little ones time. As a parent myself and remembering what traveling with little ones could be like I am sure the mother of this child was very appreciative.,10frontier-airlines,14/01/13,"We paid for classic plus going from KC to Denver and stretch on the return. You get 36"" of legroom but the seats were flat and uncomfortable at least for my back! On both flights we took off around 40 mins late with no apology or explanation. The flight attendants looked tired and were unfriendly. The check in staff were just as bad. Frontier needs to improve its customer service. A shame as they are good value.",5frontier-airlines,09/01/13,Unacceptable service for our charter 12/23/12 to Punta Cana from Chicago and again back on 12/30-31/12. In brief 3 flights from O'Hare on 12/23 all delayed several hrs flight to Montego Bay was cancelled all because none of the crews were complete. They knew this was going to happen and never notified any of us. Offered no info or help. Coming back we waited 2 hrs at Punta Cana airport then flight cancelled.,frontier-airlines,07/01/13,December 2012 round trip between Madison WI and Washington DC. The planes were up-to-date and the seats very comfortable. The service was superb at check-in gate and through the flight. Crew were organized and friendly. A nice touch was the raising of the cabin lights during beverage service. Many food items were available for sale. We didn't buy any but liked that there were options. Flights were comfortable and calm.,10frontier-airlines,02/01/13,We flew on Christmas Day from Madison to DCA (Reagan). It left 2 hours late. Return flight on 12/30/2012 left 4 hours late. Seemed to be a problem in gathering crew for the flight. Unprofessional appearance and very casual attitude. Here in Wisconsin we like having the option for a non-stop from Madison to Washington DC but the service is terrible. Hope I can find another way.,1frontier-airlines,02/01/13,Flew round trip from Ft Myers to Denver 12/12. Flight out was no problem. Return flight - flight listed as on time on the screens but we boarded over 30 minutes late. No announcement made that explained when we would be boarding the reason for the delay or any kind of apology or assurance. Asked to check our carryon bags at the gate which was not a problem except that my companion was not given the receipt from her bag check. The agent said she would be right back with the tag never returned and when my friend asked the attendant she was sent to the front of the plane and told by the gate agent that there was no way they could find the receipt. During the flight we experienced strong turbulence no acknowledgement was made by the flight attendants or by the pilot over the intercom system. We don't plan to fly Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,31/12/12,We left Seattle late but the gate and flight crew told us that the connection in Denver for my flight to Orlando would wait for us. Flight was pleasant and the air crew good. However the plane did not wait and no flights available until tomorrow. To add insult to injury they lost my bag.,frontier-airlines,31/12/12,Delayed over 2 hours. None of it related to weather issues. It was because we were short a stewardess for our flight and we had to wait for them to arrive from another city. My first and last time my children and I fly Frontier Airlines. Completely unacceptable.,frontier-airlines,31/12/12,Virginia to California in economy. They checked in all of the classic plus customers before checking in a single Economy customer. I and many others nearly missed our flights because of this. Once I actually got to my plane to make the 5 hour trip I realized once again because I was an economy passenger I then had to pay for movies! There's was no entertainment either direction which made for an even worse experience. On my way back to Virginia I had a lay over in Denver and realized my original flight Id bought from Colorado to Virginia was no longer in service and I had a 6 hour layover. I was never notified of the cancellation and this just confirmed that I will never fly with them again.,2frontier-airlines,28/12/12,Had an emergency flight back to Ohio. I left Albuquerque in bad weather but was reassured by Albuquerque Frontier staff that I would be able to catch the next flight back to Ohio. Frontier airlines in Denver knew that we would not be able to make the connection and told me that the Albuquerque Frontier station frequently tells customers that they will be able to make connections that are not possible in an effort to get them out of Albuquerque to be someone else's problem. I had the 'pleasure' of sleeping in the Denver airport overnight because staff in Denver said that they were not liable for putting me up in a hotel.,frontier-airlines,25/12/12,My 2 older children had a flight from DIA to Grand Rapids and they sat in the airport for 6 hours before Frontier cancelled the flight. The were rebooked for the following morning. We arrived at 6 am flight just to be informed that flight was cancelled. We received no compensation or upgrades for the inconvenience. They rebooked us for what was our original 2 hour flight tomorrow to fly 4 hours to Houston 3 hour layover and then another 4 hours to Detroit - not their airport of origin. I have 4 children returning 12/28 on Frontier what are the chances they will all make it?,frontier-airlines,20/12/12,My wife and I flew Frontier on a whim since it was our honeymoon and they offered a non-stop flight. The flight to our destination was uneventful even pleasant. On the return the ticket staff were incredibly rude. We paid additional for the both of us to sit together in the middle of the aircraft however when we arrived we were seated at opposite ends of the plane. After spending an hour trying to get the issue resolved we had to resign ourselves to the back of the plane negating the extra money we spent for preferred seating.,frontier-airlines,20/12/12,Awful experience ticket agent was very rude. Our flight had been moved to another day without notifying us the ticket agent said it was not his problem and we needed to contact the other airlines to find a flight to Orlando. He finally did find us a flight on American and it was already boarding so we had to run to catch the plane our option to fly home was stay an extra day in Orlando which we could not do or fly from Orlando to Denver to Madison WI which we had to do. Fly another airline.,frontier-airlines,18/12/12,We flew to Puna Canta. Attendants were friendly and attentive we were celebrating our 50th anniversary and enjoyed the trip there and back. Impressed with the cleanliness of the bathrooms and the room in them. Hope to fly them again.,10frontier-airlines,06/12/12,Depending on which rules they choose to enforce you can never be assured that you will be granted access to their boarding process. I am a young woman with a certified disability. I live 4 hours from Oklahoma airport and after waiting on the check in line presented my travel documents 4 minutes late according to their boarding rules. I was not allowed to check in for my scheduled flight. I was re-routed to an intermediary city where I had to spend the night before catching a flight to my final destination. Do not fly this airline especially if you have children or special needs!,frontier-airlines,03/12/12,Booked one way GSO-MCO Nov 26th. Few minutes late leaving and arriving but no problem. Cabin staff friendly and competent. Plane clean and IFE working. Thanks Frontier for bringing low cost full size plane service to GSO.,8frontier-airlines,02/12/12,Very disappointed with Frontier Airlines service on our trip out to visit family for Thanksgiving. They did not make traveling with two young children easy (1 toddler 1 infant). We selected seats together at the airport we could not sit together because we didn't pay the extra $5 fee for the opportunity to select seats. So we pay the upgrade for the 1st leg of our flight but they keep us in separate rows and seats for the second leg. With a 2.5 year old and an 8 month old we're all going to sit in separate seats? I highly dissuade any families from using Frontier. We flew home on United and had no problems whatsoever sitting together.,1frontier-airlines,02/12/12,"I had a combined round-trip ticket flying American from Tulsa to Denver then Frontier to Minneapolis; coming back was the reverse Frontier out of Minneapolis then American to Tulsa. It was ticketed through American. Flying to Minneapolis was fine because I didn't really have to interact with checking in at Frontier. However the return was horrible. I arrived at the airport later than I planned but still had a half hour before takeoff when I tried to check in at the Frontier counter. The attendant wouldn't let me check in because he said I wouldn't make it in time. I had a half hour but he wouldn't even let me try. I asked if there was anything he could do and he said no. Other airlines have been known to call the gate tell them the passenger was on the way and ask them to hold the plane. But not Frontier. He was also unwilling to help me get on a later flight because ""it's ticketed through American let them help you"". I went to the American desk. They were very friendly and tried to help. However it would cost $150 to change my ticket and fly from Minneapolis with them so they suggested I go back to the Frontier desk and ask them to sign my ticket over to American. The attendant would not help me and rudely said it was my fault because I was late. But he finally said they could put me on standby on the next plane which would leave 4 hours later but said it was full so my chances weren't good. I went back to American and paid my $150. From now on I will pay a little more to deal with a friendly helpful person.",1frontier-airlines,30/11/12,We were supposed to leave on a 1.12 flight to Denver and our plane had started boarding when an announcement was made that there may be an aircraft change. There was - the plane headed to Harrisburg directly across from our gate started deboarding and got on our plane and took off. Here we sit 3 hours after we were supposed to leave with another 5 hour wait before we can leave. What I don't understand is why we had to sacrifice our plane and time for the folks going to Harrisburg. It's a huge inconvenience. We will never fly with Frontier again.,frontier-airlines,26/11/12,Flew Frontier 3 times this week (Denver to Phoenix 11/16 Phoenix to Denver 11/17 and Denver to Dallas 11/24). This was the first time I had used this carrier. Not a single flight left on time average delay on each flight was 2-3 hours (always blamed on mechanical delays). I understand being delayed once in a while but 3 out of 3? Also staff (from the baggage checker to flight attendants) were grouchy and the customer service reps essentially told me too bad (never once apologized for the inconvenience). I fly a fair amount (20+ times per year) and have been on almost all major US carriers this one takes the cake as the worst!,frontier-airlines,19/11/12,I flew from Austin TX to Portland OR changing both ways in Denver CO. On all 4 planes the aisles were so narrow that it was difficult to even enter the plane. The planes seem to have been changed from 5-seat rows to 6-seat rows and additional rows added. This meant that the seats were so close together that the experience was like being a sardine in a can. When the stewards were passing out drinks on one flight they parked the cart by my row and served the whole plane from there. When the passenger in front of me lowered their seat they were in my lap. Never again will I fly Frontier.,frontier-airlines,14/11/12,Will never fly Frontier again. Was on 4 different flights and were only greeted twice by flight attendants. Made arrangements in April for a November trip and had no choice of seats at reservation time only to be told at check in you will get your seat at the gate. Gate staff were rude. We had a first time flyer with us and nicely asked if she could be seated with one of us so she wasn't alone. Only to be told we were lucky to be on this flight. The 4 of us were separated on all the flights we were on. When you're flying for over 3 hours it would be nice to sit with someone you know.,2frontier-airlines,21/10/12,Denver to Dayton to visit family in Ohio. Have flown Frontier many times before staff have always been courteous and apart from when I've flown home in the winter the flights have been on time. I have a direct flight so don't know about connecting flights.,8frontier-airlines,18/10/12,Flew from Orange County to Detroit with a stop in Denver. Boarding in Orange County was fine was seated at the very back of the plane which I hate but that is the luck of the draw. Flight started with flight attendant saying the TV system was broken for the flight . Beverage cart came around giving us a shot glass of Pop. Landed in Denver 15 minutes late. Only had 15 minutes to catch my next flight which was 7 minute away from gate to gate. Being at the very back of the plane killed another 5 minutes. We rushed (with no assistance from the airlines) to our connecting flight and was made to feel like it was our fault when arriving at the next plane for holding up the flight. Never even looked at our boarding passes just ordered us on the plane. Why would they put us at the very back of the plane on the first flight when we had a tight connection like that. I booked over a month in advance. Second flight to the very back of the plane again. Air did not work in our seats and when asked attendant about it she brushed it off in addition the seats do not go back when you are in the last row which made it tight. Then the TV came on and was disappointed we had the pay $5.99 if we wanted to watch it. Overall very uncomfortable flight with rude attendants. I flew AA a week earlier and had a great experience.,1frontier-airlines,04/10/12,Even though I booked round trip tickets with Frontier I never once got on an actual plane the departing flight was cancelled altogether and the return flight was delayed so long that the connection would have been impossible to make. Making matters worse I was flying to my sister's wedding in California from Michigan and could not afford to wait for following day much less trust that it would go. So they rebooked myself and my daughter on a flight from Detroit to Washington/Dulles then after hurrying to the connecting gate we flew clear across the continental US something like 5 straight hours. Not much fun to say the least. Coming home we were forced to layover an extra day so my 5 day trip turned into a six day trip with three days spent entirely at airports. As far as this review goes I can't give an opinion because I never got on their plane! My sister booked my niece on the same flight so the same thing happened to her except they rebooked her on US Airways and she flew from DTW to Phoenix but never made her connection to California.,frontier-airlines,20/09/12,I will never fly Frontier again. The staff were rude and made us very uncomfortable. They were not helpful at the baggage check in this was in PHX on the morning of Sep 12th. On our connecting flight going to Nashville one of the flight attendants snapped at me when I asked where the restroom was. Their lack of customer service made my experience lousy. On our way back we took United Airlines. Totally different.,2frontier-airlines,11/09/12,Overall I was very satisfied. Online booking was smooth I had no problems boarding and the flight left and arrived on time in Denver. I flew from Salt Lake to Little Rock to visit family and I might have to push my return date out so I am curious as to how smooth that will go. The drinks on flight were a small cup with ice the food was expensive and so were alcoholic drinks so I refrained from those. I would recommend this flight and would also add that more leg room would be nice.,8frontier-airlines,09/09/12,My flight to Colorado Springs with connection at Denver was delayed which in turn made me miss my connection flight. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to fly the next day at 8 am. We were told that they were holding flights when in fact my connection flight left 7 minutes earlier than suppose to. This is the last time I fly Frontier. I was told by another flyer that this happens way to frequent and he was driving from Denver to Colorado Springs. This was my first time flying alone to this airport. They have made this a bad experience. This airline needs to get their act together.,1frontier-airlines,28/08/12,I was travelling with my 4 year old. My flight to Portland with connection at Denver was delayed 3 hours. First they said it was due to weather but then they said it was a mechanical problem with the flight. I was to miss my connection at Denver. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to either stay back at Denver or fly the next day at 9 am. The next day they were so fuzzy about my baggage being overweight by 1 pound - the same bag they checked in yesterday but had to get back due to flight delay. They made me remove stuff from my bag and finally they lost my bag. Staff at Portland responsible for baggage claim was impossible. I am still waiting for my baggage to arrive and I am hoping I would get it back.,1frontier-airlines,28/08/12,Portland-Denver-Jackson Hole in A320/A319. Smooth online booking online check-in and bag drop Flights on time and the service efficient. Seats in the cheapest part of the plane offered as much legroom as premium airlines' Economy. A non-alcoholic drink was served on each leg (no free snack). The hub at Denver was quite crowded and busy. Luggage took a long time to be unloaded at Jackson Hole. Overall a good experience.,7frontier-airlines,16/08/12,"I arrive at the airport 2 hours ahead of time to find the Frontier line out of the door. There were two extremely slow agents and a slew of broken kiosks. After an hour in line I finally got through security to find out my flight was delayed. Because of this I would miss my connecting flight. Frontier rebooked me on one of their later itineraries - one that would get in 3 hours 17 minutes later than my original itinerary. Even though there was other flights available on other carriers I was booked on this flight. After doing some research on Frontiers website I found Frontier's policy about controllable flights. ""If we can't get you on a Frontier flight scheduled to arrive within three hours of your original itinerary we'll do our best to arrange for you to fly on another available carrier or combination of carriers with whom we have agreements."" After bringing this to the attention of the agent at the gate I was booked on another connecting flight on another airline. Then I found out our original flight was cancelled so I would miss my new connecting flight. While standing in line at the gate trying to rebook my flight I was told I had to go back to the ticketing counter to do so. I had been standing in this line for 45 minutes already. I proceeded back through security and waited in another line for an hour and a half line to try to rebook to get on a new flight. I cannot believe an airline could be so incompetent. I feel that it is ridiculous that I have to go on Frontier's website and show it to Frontier agents in order for anything to happen.",1frontier-airlines,16/08/12,I flew to Portland OR from NYC via Denver. Outbound trip was great. On the way back on DEN-LGA leg of the journey the pilot made an emergency landing in Indianapolis. The next 16 hours is a case study in trying to buy off customers for poor quality service. Instead of having enough people on the ground to service the accommodation of 150+ passengers the airline effectively paid the passengers to struggle through the limited resources available on the ground in Indianapolis to assist them. I ended up sleeping the night in a cold airport lounge and slogged through multiple re-scheduling of the continuation of my trip from Indianapolis to NYC. I tore up the $400 airline voucher I got for the inconvenience.,3frontier-airlines,07/08/12,We (5 people) travelled from GEG to DEN on 08/03/12. I was travelling with my disabled daughter in a wheelchair. During reservation I had already informed them that my daughter is in a wheelchair and cannot walk. We checked in online and after going through security arrived at gate C32. After the gate agent arrived I reminded her that we need an aisle chair. She said that as per 'normal' Frontier procedure when travelling with a wheelchair passenger I should have checked in at the counter and not online. I never saw this instruction on their website. She also mentioned that they can deny us boarding for not doing that. I did complain about this to the airline and they rewarded me the with a whopping $25 certificate per passenger that can only be used for 'future' travel on this customer un-friendly airline. Frontier provides only complementary beverage no food.,1frontier-airlines,22/07/12,"I just returned from a trip with Frontier Airlines and I hope it is the last time I need to travel with them. Unlike other reviewers we were not offered a cookie with our drink. We had a delay of 6 hours which was not Frontier's fault however people were tired. A nice gesture would have been to offer flyers a whole can of Pepsi not just the usual half ice and half drink that all airlines offer after the wait was over. Instead we had one steward who was not rude but obviously tired. Frontier like most airlines does charge. Their term for this is ""excess baggage"" when you check it in. It's not excess it's your luggage bag. However what I was amazed about was Frontier staff kept announcing before the flight that the flight was full and you should check your roll-on baggage before boarding. In both cases where I saw this done many people did check their roll ons and there was lots of space in the overhead bins. This was a DC to Denver to Billings MT round trip.",4frontier-airlines,22/07/12,All in all pretty good experience. Flights were on time check in was smooth as were the flights. Flight attendants were great. The only cons were the planes were small and cramped especially on the Denver to Spokane leg. We paid extra for Classic Plus and felt like our knees were under our chins undoubtedly due to the aircraft type and the fact that three seats were squeezed into an area probably meant for two. We were shoulder to shoulder in the three row seating and both of us are small and thin. I imagine it would be even more miserable for people who are normal sized or a little overweight. It wasn't as bad on our return flight but it wasn't full and we had an empty seat in our row. The saving grace for Frontier at least as far as we were concerned was the courtesy of the staff at the airports and the personable flight attendants.,9frontier-airlines,15/07/12,SEA-DEN-OKC-DEN-OKC. Overall service was really good. Had a huge delay from DEN-OKC due to crew scheduling issues but other 3 legs were on time. Food selection was adequate for these flight duration's but the aircraft interiors need to be refreshed. With that said seats on 3 of the 4 legs were uncomfortable due to high wear and tear. IFE was not free like Virgin America or JetBlue. It's terrible how the US airlines are charging for everything now it's getting ridiculous.,5frontier-airlines,24/06/12,Flight: In last month. Just returned last night to Anchorage. I used my Early Returns miles and took my family to ATL via DEN. All aspects of our trip were great on Frontier. We did takeoff 40 minutes late from DEN on our return but somehow managed to arrive 20 min's early into Anchorage. The planes were fine the service excellent and staff attitudes were quite positive. No problems and no complaints! I will fly them again soon!,10frontier-airlines,20/06/12,Flew from La Guardia to Denver. Flight took off 40 minutes late but otherwise a pretty pleasant experience. Newish Airbus with comfortable leather seats decent legroom and direct TV screens in seatbacks. Crew was OK but unremarkable. I'd fly them again and consider them one of the better options in my market.,8frontier-airlines,11/06/12,"I purchased a round trip Minneapolis to Santa Barbara 4 months in advance. I did not specifically look at the aisle seating I was assigned and 3 out of 4 legs I was seated just in front of the exit row and could not recline my seat (Row 10). 3 out of 4 legs were on an Embraer 190 which is a nice plane but no storage. Last leg on Airbus 320 had the most cramped seating I've experienced. They gate checked my bag half way through boarding letting the last 20 folks bring on their bags. When I asked the flight attendant what was going on she said they ""pre-emptively"" gate check bags when they have few checked bags for a full flight. Bottom line is that Frontier is not customer friendly. They will survive on price alone and they won't get my business unless I'm desperate.",2frontier-airlines,02/04/12,"LIR (Costa Rica)-DEN-LAX. Sat on the runway in CR for a 1.5 hours due to ""paperwork issues"". They wouldn't let us on our connecting flight (we made it 30 mins before departure) stating our luggage wouldn't make it on. They rebooked us to a United flight who charged us for luggage. Not a pleasant experience - will never fly them again.",2frontier-airlines,01/04/12,Flew round trip from Minneapolis to Las Vegas via Denver. Staff very friendly and the overall experience was fantastic. I recommend upgrading to Classic Plus - it is well worth the extra money!,9frontier-airlines,29/03/12,Flew roundtrip from Denver to San Diego return to Denver. Staff were friendly helping us with checking baggage. Boarding was easy boarded early due to no carry on bags. Flight staff friendly and efficient trying to get everyone's carry on bags stored. Seats were comfortable and had plenty of room. The TV was good had to pay for it but it was affordable. All of our bags made it to our destination. The return trip to Denver was just as pleasant the plane not very full so attendants let us change seats.,9frontier-airlines,26/03/12,ATL-DEN. Arrived on time however the boarding ramp would not work so had to wait 30 min for technicians to fix it before we could exit the plane. On the return DEN-ATL we sat on the runway for an hour because the plane had a malfunction. Finally unloaded off the plane just to be told to wait for another to arrive in 30 min. We arrive in ATL airport to find out the shuttles have been shut down for the night and that we would have to take buses to the baggage claim. Total delay 3 hours!,1frontier-airlines,24/03/12,My flight from DCA-MKE was delayed 1.5 hrs. In MKE my flight to DFW was cancelled due to the fact that they did not have any staff available. There were only 10 seats available on flights going to DFW for the next 2 days. Overall the worst flying experience I have had. My first and last time using this carrier.,2hawaiian-airlines,27/07/15,"Flying Hawaiians seasonal non stop was a pleasure. Comfortable seating, warm service and good food were the highlights of a pleasant comfortable experience. Nothing to add but a hearty recommendation. I actually prefer the older 767s over the newer A330's. Even the luggage was delivered in a timely manner.",8hawaiian-airlines,23/07/15,"The good: Efficient boarding, departed and arrived on time. The so so: Cabin attendants did their jobs, legroom OK, but less than jetBlue. The bad: ""Entertainment"" - Why have in-seat TV screen when nothing worthwhile to watch, unless you pay extra for it? ""Meal"" - water, few pieces of fruit, mystery cheese thing, one piece of candy. Overall opinion: Very average experience. Hawaiian should be so much better when their slogan is ""Hawaii Flies With Us"". Should not boast about serving a meal, attendants OK, but lack aloha spirit, delete ads when giving info about Hawaii before landing. Would fly again, but only because of mediocre competitors.",5hawaiian-airlines,20/07/15,"I am never flying on Hawaiian Airlines again. Once was once too many! Horrible customer service. 1) Luggage issues. They refused to send my bags all the way to the final destination. Their response was ""because you have a layover of more than 4 hours, we cannot send the bags all the way."" This was blatantly false because I later confirmed with people who had flown the exact same route and they had no issues checking their bags all the way to the final destination. Some incompetent staff, for sure! 2) In-flight service for an international flight was atrocious. When I reminded the attendant that I had requested a special meal, she replied rather rudely, ""Oh, we don't do special meals."" 3) Good luck trying to change your flights without paying a hefty amount. And even then, you were restricted to a few dates only.",1hawaiian-airlines,20/07/15,"We have flown Hawaiian airlines about 8 times, and it has been satisfying every time. The service is very good, the seat is comfortable (especially the pillows), the food is pretty good and the legroom is comfortable. We fly this airline about once every two years, and it's been very satisfying. They are kid friendly too.",7hawaiian-airlines,19/07/15,"AKL-HNL on a modern A330 in Extra Comfort seat in 11A. An excellent option at a small cost for the 9 hr long overnight flight. Whilst the seat was the same as Economy Class and the armrest was fixed, this row is situated directly behind Business Class in a small intimate cabin at the front of the plane. The leg room was huge, improving comfort and thus the ability to get some sleep. Return HNL-AKL afternoon flight was in standard Economy seat 18A and whilst a little tight when the person in front reclined, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable. On-demand movies / TV series / games were free and it was fun to watch some Hawaii-centric shows. The touch screen was not very responsive and there was no alternative controls resulting in a lot of unnecessary ""poking"". Upon embarkation, FA's handed out amenity kits comprising eye masks, headphones, earplugs and in Extra Comfort seats additional items were included in a cute little pouch. Food and drink service was prompt after takeoff and I think relevant to the time of travel. A snack pack was offered at midnight with a breakfast before arrival then on the return a hot chicken/rice dish at late PM takeoff with a sandwich as a late supper. Much better than a curry at 3am as I have experienced on some airlines. Service friendliness and professionalism was mixed depending on which crew member attended you (as always) and the return was much better but overall more than adequate. Water was offered frequently throughout the flight. My only negative would be the temperature of the cabin - it was freezing cold! The FA's were even wearing cardigans. And the complimentary blanket smelled like it had been in a smokers zone - it was disgusting. Fortunately I had packed my own. Overall I was very impressed with the flights. It represented good value and the inclusion 2 checked bags in the fare was a bonus. I would recommend this airline for this route and will fly with them again. It's a shame Honolulu Airport is their hub - it is woeful and not a pleasant experience.",9hawaiian-airlines,10/07/15,"Chaos at the airport which is more the fault of the airport administration than the airline. Though it would be nice about the need to take a shuttle to the gate and there is nothing available at gate 34 except sandwich, sweets and drinks at highly inflated prices. Impressed with the cabin crew and range of inflight entertainment - although any announcement that was made whilst I using it nearly blasted my eardrums. Not quite as cold as my earlier flight but still needed the blanket. Flight was smooth and the landing feather like.",10hawaiian-airlines,10/07/15,"My husband and I were disappointed with the inflight experience from Honolulu to Sydney (arriving SYD 7.30pm). The staff were cold, sullen and non-communicative. The food was minimal and of poor quality. We were given a terrible chicken meal at lunch and then nothing until the equivalent of 11pm (for the passengers' day), when we received sub standard sandwiches. We have never experienced an international flight like it. Additionally, the entertainment systems were problematic in that the touch screen was not sensitive enough and had to be pressed repeatedly. As a result, I had the woman behind me repeatedly pressing the back of my headrest all the way through the 10 hour flight. We will never choose this airline again for an international flight.",3hawaiian-airlines,08/07/15,"I don't usually fly business class, so this was a treat. The first class check-in was fantastic. The seats were only recliner, but very comfortable. I didn't need full flat anyway, as it was not overnight. Attendants were attentive and professional. Food was very good. In-flight entertainment was varied, and had some documentaries available that were very interesting. ",9hawaiian-airlines,08/07/15,"Check in at Brisbane was poor, the machines didn't work and there seemed to be a shortage of staff. When I finally reached the counter, the young lady was polite and helpful. The actual flight was good, except the cabin was freezing and really needed that blanket. I was involved as a helper in a medical emergency and was impressed with the care and attention given by the crew. Found the shell like seats a little hard.",9hawaiian-airlines,12/06/15,"I was so looking forward to my trip to Honolulu, but it was not a pleasant experience, was seated next to window with 1 passenger next to me, as soon as we had levelled off the woman in front of me thrust her seat back to the maximum degree and that's where it stayed the entire 8.5 hour trip, until she was asked by staff to return her
seat to upright position 5 mins from landing.  I have scoliosis and prefer to sit upright, but I was left with no room whatsoever, could not even open a magazine, I was severely restricted of any movement and trying to get out the seat to visit the toilet was near impossible, if people want to sleep the whole trip like that they should
travel 1st class and why do the seats have to go so far back. By the time we arrived in Hawaii I was in pain. I was dreading the return trip home, but just dismissed it as bad luck, the return trip I was seated in an aisle seat with empty seat next to me, well the same thing happened we hadn't even taken off and a woman put her seat
right back, I thought surely staff would correct her but obviously they didn't spot her, as soon as we had levelled out again I moved into the seat next to me, her 4 year old son was now in front of me, she then proceeded to push her sons seat back to the extended position, was this really necessary for a 4 year old, the only respite I had was move back to the aisle seat at least I was able to exit the seat so spent much of my time standing at back of airline, how could people be so oblivious to other travellers discomfort by having their seats fully extended the entire trip is beyond me, I certainly wont be travelling with this airline again it was a nightmare trip for me.",2hawaiian-airlines,11/06/15,"Our flight from Brisbane to Honolulu (overnight) was good even though an awful time to fly. My only complaint was the cabin was freezing. On the return flight this is where the problems started. The airport is mayhem and needs more signage. People wondering aimlessly. Once on board and seated. I had packed for warmth on this flight. It was a day flight leaving at 1.40pm local time. Once on board we were informed that there was no headsets, they had not been loaded onto the plane. so for the next 9 hours plus no movies, how many games can you play of Solitaire. Also on the first meal service we where informed there was no scotch as they had run out. First meal service. That is not good enough. The staff were polite, the meals OK but for an international carrier to have no headsets for a 9 hour flight is ridiculous, and concerning. Hawaiian Airlines need to pick up their game, as in pre-checks and cross checks and strict compliance procedures that must be adhered too for safety and well being of your passengers.",5hawaiian-airlines,11/06/15,"Flight from Hilo to Honolulu, new cabin, seat 5B. The new seats are perfect for the 50 min fight - lots of legroom and comfortable. Staff as normal are perfect and professional.

Very rarely can they fix problems and can often give incorrect information.",9hawaiian-airlines,06/06/15,HA30 May 28 2015. Staff at desk were cold and rude though not busy at all. Couldn't get into the Premier Lounge again third time that has happened. New scanner didn't work and we just gave up. They pre loaded a very elderly couple into our selected seats in 1st class without checking their tickets. When we went to board we were addressed like we had the wrong tickets then informed that the couple took too long to settle in and we could have their middle row in the back seats. Right in front of a comfort seat of a crying child and with a broken stuck tray table. Attendant knowing I was upset with our seating avoided us so no beverages and service at first. Then the male attendant offered to move the people though he didn't mean to made the people around look at us like we should be shamed for being mad. We were the last to be asked about meals so we got what was left curry in salad dressing really? Food was dry. The people in our seats had our desired meal too. Save your money and take Alaska Air.,hawaiian-airlines,31/05/15,HA7 8th May 2015. My 5.5 hour flight from Las Vegas to Honalulu was the worst flight I have travelled on. Cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked for a blanket was informed that I would have to pay for this a pillow would also be provided as part of this fee (a lot of help that would be to me when I arrived in Honolulu). The 'meal service' if you could call it that was appalling. Our meal consisted of soggy watermelon cantaloupe and a few grapes served with cheese and crackers. Also informed that to use the inflight entertainment I would have to purchase a set of aircraft earphones as well as pay per view for movies/TV shows. So much for the Aloha friendly airline advertised on their ensuite. Flight staff were rude and unhelpful obviously not happy to be in the job. Hawaiian Airlines- you got me this time but never again!,hawaiian-airlines,28/05/15,Sydney - Honolulu - Hilo. Today I was impressed with Hawaiian econ plus seat 11G I normally travel business class but was fully booked. Staff at Sydney check in were very good typical friendly while being professional. Boarding was good business and families first then econ plus. The seat is in a row 11 just behind business and has excellent leg room it's also in a quiet 3 row section away from the main cabin. Cabin crew excellent as usual high degree of customer service. During a medical problem on board they were very professional and showed honest care for the customer. The food for econ was very hot when served constant drinks available throughout the flight. Overall very impressed. 2 negatives having to pay for lounge entry in Sydney for platinum Hawaiian when platinum velocity can get in free. Next the ground crew at the inter island terminal were nowhere even close to the flight crew in customer service skills. The short island hop was in first as a free upgrade again friendly professional crew.,8hawaiian-airlines,12/05/15,Our family of four recently flew from Brisbane to Honolulu return with Hawaiian Airlines. We found ourselves to be pleasantly surprised by the airline. All of our flights were on schedule the service from crew was very friendly and helpful. For example on one flight our daughter wasn't hungry at the time our first meal was served. Later in the flight we asked what food options were available to purchase and the flight attendant then returned with a spare full meal. I also liked the fact that the staff offered water numerous times throughout the flight and also collected rubbish at very regular intervals. More so than anything other flight I have been on and I really appreciated these small measures which add to the enjoyment of the flight. The seats were comfortable enough with sufficient leg room. Would like to see a little more variety in the entertainment offered (movie and television show wise). We found the check in process not to be completely straight forward. Both occasions on checking in the machines were not working correctly. We then had to be checked in by a staff member at the desk. Overall though I would definitely fly with Hawaiian Airlines again.,8hawaiian-airlines,16/04/15,We flew non-stop from New York to HNL. On the way there we tried extra comfort. Staff were great plane was late getting into JFK but made up time and we arrived only about 20 min late. Seats were ok. Boarding was good also. On the way back to JFK non stop from HNL we bought first class seats - what a disappointment. Seats are about as good as extra comfort nothing better. Food was not good at all. They need to look into United first class seats which recline almost to flat status or look into SAS. Staff at Hawaiian on both flights were great but the rest was terrible.,hawaiian-airlines,25/03/15,We recently flew Hawaiian Air from Seattle to Maui and return. Return flight was delayed and we had nothing but good come from it. They were very apologetic and one of the girls at the gate did a Hula dance for us and gave volunteers lessons. I enjoyed every minute of the flight there and back and liked the A30 airbus. It was our first experience flying Hawaiian Air and we will be flying it again next year to Maui. We were alerted via email that there was a delay so got to stay by the pool for a bit longer!,10hawaiian-airlines,09/03/15,We were instructed to confirm our onward flight to San Francisco when we reached Honolulu. Flight to SFO was next day (4th Feb). Rang to confirm this flight and were informed because of a time change in the flight we had to have a new ticket issued and that we would have to ring our agent in Australia to enable this to happen. We rang our agent who checked with Hawaiian Airlines Sydney office to be told no that our ticket that we held was fine and it was when we checked in. I had to make a call to Australia which was not easy and it took nearly 2 hours of our precious time in Honolulu. Not good. Also the food on the plane although I had requested a meal without tomato and mushrooms there was no option. One meal was all that was available and we had it twice with tomato which disagrees with me.,1hawaiian-airlines,18/02/15,LAX-HNL-AKL. New A330 aircraft on both legs.

Terrible business class. No lie flat seats. The seats have only minimal recline. Seats are manually operated with no power assistance. Disgraceful lounges in Hawaii. Poor beverages inflight: prosecco (no champagne) red label scotch one cheap red and one cheap white for wine. Food is poor. Inflight staff are very nice. The on the ground staff are rude. Overall a terrible business class which they ironically call first-class!,1hawaiian-airlines,14/01/15,We traveled business class return Brisbane - Honolulu on new Airbus A300 aircraft. Only two negatives were limited pitch of business class seats as did not fully lie flat and limited movie selection on in flight entertainment. Food and inflight service was excellent.,8hawaiian-airlines,18/12/14,We flew Sydney-Honolulu-Sydney. We paid for extra comfort upgrades. We sat in seats 11A and 11B on the way to Honolulu and on the way back 14H and 14J. These seats provided a great amount of legroom for what we paid. The seats themselves were the most uncomfortable seats I've flown in - very hard. The service however was good. All crew members were friendly and flights departed and arrived on schedule. The food was pretty good as well.,7hawaiian-airlines,10/12/14,"ITO-HNL-LAX return. Bulking at the cost of suitcases on the first leg of a trip to the UK we bought Premier Club cards as we checked in online. We understood matters would not tie up instantly and expected difficulties with the famously belligerent HA ground staff. This was not the case at Hilo where the charming early morning desk hand gave us the code for the lounge (for coffee) and sent us on our way. Well fine but HNL proved true to course Having got our boarding passes certified we went to board as Zone two only to have them snatched by a woman standing next to the line we wanted who said as loudly as possible "" This is first class you can not board here!"" Now we were not trying to board there and how prey does anybody which line which when they are not marked? Are HA loyal customers clairvoyant? On board good planes they do give passenger food in this case a good fruit breakfast and a rum cocktail before landing. Route back OK. Sad lounge at LAX but it is LAX nobody can work miracles and the on board service was good enough. Whether Premier Club is worth it only time will tell. I hope some of the money paid goes to training ground staff.",6hawaiian-airlines,20/11/14,Just booked OAK-OGG in 1st last night. Price was right after watching it for a week. This will be our 3rd trip to Maui in two years going with HA in 1st. Service has always been great with HA. Food good presentation well done. Wish there was more room in the 767's they use for this route. But fear that with the Slated smaller A/C proposed to take over this route we're not fans of in the least bit. Sure the 767's are showing their age but the staff tend to make the flights well worth it. In fact on last trip I left items at the check-in counter and didn't realize it until we were on the plane. Got off the plane and spoke with gate agent. She confirm with check-in person my items were there and that they'd store them until we returned since it was close to us departing. And to my surprise the check-in agent boarded the plane and handed me my items!,9hawaiian-airlines,20/11/14,"We flew return from Sydney to LAX then returning from Las Vegas. Of 4 flights only one left on-time. The flight from Honolulu to LAX left 2 hours late because of delayed fuelling. This happened again from Las Vegas (1h15m wait) and the flight was already delayed by 14 hours due to crew working hours. Our connection from HNL to Sydney (already 1 day late) left the gate but had a flat tire and we waited 1 hour to fix it. Honolulu to Sydney the entertainment system did not work for over an hour and when it was rebooted the ""Movies on Demand"" were not free as advertised on the website for International Passengers. I did ask about not having to pay $7.99 per film but the flight attendant didn't seem to appreciate my request and ignored my call button for the duration of the trip. Staff seemed intent on hiding behind curtains. Poor service onboard and the Customer Service department is equally poor. 24 working days to get a response. I won't be using Hawaiian again â€“ avoid at all costs!",hawaiian-airlines,12/11/14,We snagged $1300 return to Seattle as part of a Canada a trip with a stopover in Hawaii for 3 days on the way back. For the price paid and considering we are a family of five could not complain. Staff are friendly with constant drink top ups and smiles. Meals are not huge and the lack of free entertainment is a small problem. I guess if I had paid a premium price I would of been a bit let down as the other airlines out there are better. I would definitely fly them again if the price was right.,7hawaiian-airlines,12/11/14,They do not have their own staff for check in at JFK there were 4 kiosks and only 2 worked. The staff were not welcoming or friendly and borderline rude. They kept mostly to themselves and barely smiled during JFK-HNL - no aloha spirit. Video selection was limited and a la carte not one free movie they charged for everything even regular tv-cable shows that are free on other carriers. The Hawaiian Airlines video history and commercials with smiling friendly flight crew are free. We were treated to 2 gourmet packets of stale crushed peanut mix during the 10.5 hr flight. They don't give whole soda cans - just cups of beverage. Meal was half heated pasta with tomato paste - so eat well before boarding. Being a Hawaiian living in NYC I did so much to promote this airline in NYC within my social circles company and whenever I can. It breaks my heart to see how they have completely disintegrated as a company and lost the spirit of aloha. I travel frequently throughout the year and have flown on all carriers in USA - Hawaiian Airlines is the worst for the cost and experience. There are much better cheaper carrier/options.,1hawaiian-airlines,06/11/14,"ITO-HNL. Early morning check-in usual poor attitude from ground staff HA seems to like to employ. Flight on time though with their ""New"" boarding process (zones 1 2 and 3) they insist on boarding the plane backwards. Anyway it was the usual overhead bins at the back of the plane were full and closed. What do they ship to take four and a half bins out of service? Drink service on the short flight the coffee was quite good. The way back really showed how poor the inter-island flights are now HA have a virtual monopoly. Full flight standard HA board in reverse and low and behold the overhead bins at the back are full again despite no passengers being in the seats yet. Find somewhere to stow carry on but told to put laptop under the seat in front. It does not fit and with the already meagre seat pitch I ended up with my knees almost on my ears. Water or sugary juice to drink from plastic containers It all shows how far HA have fallen since Aloha failed. I dread my next flights this coming week.",hawaiian-airlines,06/11/14,Such an average airline. Travelled first class Honolulu to Sydney. The service was poor and the seats very uncomfortable. If travelling between Australia and Honolulu book on either Qantas or save money on Jetstar. Avoid this airline.,2hawaiian-airlines,03/11/14,I travelled on 3 flights with Hawaiian airlines. From Oahu to Maui Maui to Oahu then Oahu to New York. I was surprised to be charged $25 per flight for the short island flights per bag put into the hold. But my main issue was that unlike all other airlines Hawaiian airlines do not cater for non meat eaters. If you are a vegetarian there are no food options for you even on the 9hr flight from Oahu to New York. In this day and age that is totally unacceptable.,6hawaiian-airlines,22/10/14,Sydney-Honolulu-JFK early October and back same route. Positives - no delay clean cabin reasonably clean lavatory friendly cabin crew 60kg check-in luggage. Negatives - more expensive than most other airlines. No meal choice - chicken and rice only salad inedible. Poor navigation on console choice of movies/TV limited. Meagre snacks cost extra only water is free during flight. Honolulu airport check-in and security hall is overcrowded and poorly air-conditioned. US domestic leg clearly sub-standard compared to int'l route. Overall typical boring American-style airline with nothing to be remembered for. If you are used to Qantas or any good Asian or Middle Eastern airlines then you are in for a real cattle class ride. Won't be flying with them again at the current price.,5hawaiian-airlines,05/10/14,I was most disappointed with the Business class lounge in Honolulu the worst I have ever been in. I also thought that for a business class fare I would get a seat with more recline I didn't expect a flat bed. I found it to be a lot more expensive than economy which I used twelve months ago and was quite happy with but thought I would treat myself as I was travelling alone this time.,5hawaiian-airlines,28/09/14,I flew business class from Sydney to Honolulu. Getting through Sydney airport was a dream no queuing for check-in and expedient trip through both customs and security with priority. The Air New Zealand lounge was adequate clean and comfortable. It is not the best lounge I have spent time in but having said that there was good selection of food and drink. Boarding was effortless and again done with priority. The plane was old and it showed in the console and to a lesser extent the seats. The seats were comfortable plenty of leg room the seat recline was not sufficient enough for a comfortable nights sleep. The leg and foot rest mechanism in my seat was faulty. The staff were wonderful and very attentive both food and drink were plentiful and a good variety to choose from. The entertainment selection was good but a few more recent release movies would have been nice. I had a window seat once the seat in front of me reclined I literally had to climb over the console to be able to go to the toilet. The USB charge facility did not work so don't rely on that. All the above pertains to the trip home as well with the Exception of the Hawaiian Airline Lounge at Honolulu Airport. If your idea of a business class lounge is a cup of coffee or a soft drink then you will be happy. Not only did they not provide anything other than a packet of nuts they do not allow you to take any food or drinks in. I would not bother using it again the point being the lounge facility is part and parcel of flying business and first class and Hawaiian need to lift their game. Again I must say I could not fault the flight staff or the food and beverage services on the aircraft.,7hawaiian-airlines,17/09/14,Flew Hawaiian from Sydney this August. Could not sit in lounge at airport until just before boarding. Arrived at Honolulu to Big Island. Boarded plane but could not take off. They had no air con. Finally took off but could not disembark. Door could not open. It was an extremely long trip. Coming home we were told just before boarding from Honolulu there would be no audio for. 10 hour flight. I had to upgrade as I cannot sit in a confined space for that amount of time. Seated in business class. The air con was freezing all the way. Given IPads but battery kept running out. Could not rewind to where I finished my movie so had to watch it all over again with another IPad. The air con was freezing all the way home. Even the crew were wearing jackets jumpers etc. it was the worst trip there and back we have ever encounterd. Never again. Could not even get a cup of coffee after dinner. Only tea. Did not have decaf coffee. Someone forgot to make it.,2hawaiian-airlines,17/09/14,"HNL-KOA-HNL in economy. We had a very uneventful flight with Hawaiian Airlines inter-island. They have good teamwork onboard the FA uniforms are really smart the ""juice"" is rotten (so just get water) up and down and painless flights. In the poorly designed Kona airport I liked how Hawaiian have a ramp for the entry to the plane for wheelchair passengers and everyone with their giant roller bags. Can't imagine how boarding would work with stairs only. They have a monopoly on inter-island travel so it could be far worse.",9hawaiian-airlines,14/09/14,Gone downhill in the last few years. We're First Class flyers and their food is almost inedible now and it used to be delicious. They've yet to upgrade the dated 767's out of San Jose on their non-stops to Maui. Nothing very special about HA anymore. Their food used to be top notch now we eat before we get on the plane. Not saying much for First Class huh?,2hawaiian-airlines,14/09/14,Very poor airline when compared to the main airlines. Considering the price we paid for first class the standard service quality of food and overall experience was very poor. We traveled from Honolulu to New York we found the first class lounge to be dirty and lacked any food or drink. The seat on the aircraft did not recline very far the pillow and blanket were the same as in economy food menu only had two selections as for a wine list it did not exist. They need to look at some of the European airlines and learn how it should and can be done.,3hawaiian-airlines,14/09/14,We were loyal HA flyers for years. We loved that we could finally afford First Class from San Jose to Maui (our favorite place in the world). We try to go 2x yearly. The vacation started on the plane! That was then. Over the last 3 years Hawaiian's First Class services have declined dramatically. Starting with their food. What was a highly rated menu scripted by the GM of the Hali'maile General Store in Maui (great restaurant) is now normal coach nasty airline faire. The speed of the decline is epic. The 'ghetto birds' (767) still flying the non stop route from SJ to OGG are an insult to us Nor Cal folks. Why are the new planes not in place yet? The planes are old tattered and the seating in First Class is more like a glorified coach. Our last trip in January had us on the runway at OGG for 12 hours! Delay after delay we even had a crew switch as laws had them time out. Rude flight attendants were rampant on this trip as well (something we'd never seen on HA prior). Our son was due back at school Monday morning and a flight that was supposed to have us home at 8pm Sunday night had us landing at 7.30am Monday morning. No dinner no drinks nothing that we paid double what coach travellers paid. So this once great airline is no more unfortunately.,3hawaiian-airlines,06/09/14,Our recent return flight from Honolulu was lacking to say the least. My son and his wife who were honeymooning were seated separately. My son who is quadriplegic was lifted into the aisle seat then a stranger placed in the adjacent window seat which meant the woman would have to repeatedly climb over him to her seat. My son and his wife were travelling with a 16 month old who was a delight throughout the flight. When the steward came through with the meagre sandwich offering we asked for a sandwich for the baby to which she replied 'I will have to see if there are any left'. The baby had no seat but they were charged $300 anyway. Would you not expect a sandwich for that? Especially when there is no food for sale custom laws make it very difficult to bring your own and there are many hours between meals. So mean spirited it took the aloha out of our trip.,3hawaiian-airlines,06/09/14,I flew first class on 12/8/14 from Seattle to Honolulu. Was very disappointed as the inflight entertainment did not work. For what you pay in first class it should be working I am hoping they will honour my request for a voucher as the ticket was pricey. Please do give better options for food as well. This airline needs to lower its prices for what you get.,5hawaiian-airlines,01/09/14,We flew Brisbane - Honolulu for the 5th time in August 2nd time with Hawaiian Airlines this time we flew Bus class and was worth paying the extra the service was typically American very friendly and helpful and the food was great with plenty of choices and plenty of drinks. There was an ipad to watch movies for the duration of the flight. All round a great flight and fantastic crew.,10hawaiian-airlines,26/08/14,In Feb we booked our seats flying from Hawaii to Las Vegas. We booked four seats together as there were personal and mental issues that necessitated careful planning. In August On the day of our flight without consultation Hawaiian Airlines changed our seats. We were separated two of us were put in row 46 and apart. These non reclining seats were a nightmare. I checked the seats we had booked the passengers sitting there were random. To add injury to insult the staff member in Hawaii at the check in counter for our return flight had the arrogance to say there are no non reclining seats on the plane. Maybe Hawaiian Airlines needs to let their staff have the experience from hell. We will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again. We are spreading the word through our large circle of travelling friends.,1hawaiian-airlines,03/08/14,Flew Brisbane to Honolulu return in last few weeks. Seats comfortable with lots of leg room. No movies shown overnight. Movies shown on way home in the day. Only big screen. Service ok. Food too spicy. Kids meals very good. On way home 2hrs out no toilets in entire plans. Some problem. They didn't announce that though. Check in at Honolulu is entirely self check in. Rather daunting. Wouldn't recommend for elderly not a lot of help around. Would fly them again for excellent luggage allowance!,7hawaiian-airlines,10/07/14,Flew SYD-HNL-PDX return June/July 2014 with Hawaiian. The price was right and the A330 aircraft configuration of 2-4-2 was handy for couples and family groups alike. Seats were rather hard on the behind after a few hours and getting up to move the limbs is hard if crew are working the aisles with snacks & meals though these weren't too common. It is all pretty no frills stuff though on the international sectors all the in flight entertainment is free but premium content is paid for on domestic sectors. The meals were adequate on international but really a token effort on domestic although Hawaiian claims they are the sole US airline to feed you on domestic sectors anyway. SYD-HNL is overnight so it is best to just try to sleep or doze the night away after they feed you an hour or so out of SYD. a 3 hour layover and HNL-PDX is a daytime flight that arrives just after dark in the last bit of the trip. PDX-HNL is daytime but is a bearable 5.5 hours or so. My most negative comments are about the HNL-SYD sectors flown almost entirely in daytime again staff feed you an hour or two out and do a few rounds of drinks but then want everyone to close the blinds and basically sleep/doze/not bother them for the next 7 hours or so. Overall we got to PDX for a month at a super low fare and knew what to expect having read a number of reviews here so had reasonably low expectations for all the additional things airlines can add to make trips bearable. I'd hate to have paid full price for the trip. Having said that for the same price we'd probably do it again.,7hawaiian-airlines,30/06/14,We flew Hawaiian Airlines on our recent trip from Auckland to Honolulu return as well as flights from Honolulu to Maui return. We were very pleased with all flights. Air crew planes and all check in staff were excellent and we were pleased to have chosen Hawaiian to fly with. We will definitely fly with them again.,10hawaiian-airlines,25/06/14,On flight from Sydney to Honolulu on an A330 airbus upgraded to extra comfort seats for an extra $80 per person located behind Business Class plenty of leg room but hard and uncomfortable but little else which doesn't add up to the package offer for the upgrade everything else is the same as in economy. No movies unless you pay for them. Drinks limited to wine or beer. Food on offer is mediocre. Flight attendants friendly I have flown on similar 3 star airlines that provide much more than on offer with this airline. The return flight wasn't much better still had to pay for extras including inflight entertainment snacks which were limited and ran out quickly. Did not upgrade to extra comfort seat this time and not much difference with the same service except for some extra leg room. Don't think I fly with this carrier again as there is better options at the same or near price. Be aware it's self check in at Honolulu airport including luggage.,3hawaiian-airlines,25/06/14,Not the friendliest crew on this trip. I have flown with Hawaiian before and the staff was great but this time it was complete opposite. On this flight there weren't any pillows or blankets and the plane was cold. There is always one screaming kid and just my luck he was beside me and his Mom and her group of friends really didn't try to calm him down so this happened the entire flight which was about 5.5-6 hrs. The seats were uncomfortable and my seat didn't recline at all. Paid too much for what we ended up with.,5hawaiian-airlines,16/06/14,Travelled from Honolulu to Sydney. Seats squashed together and hard and uncomfortable. Less room than on an Australian domestic flight. 7.5 hours between lunch and dinner there was a limited range of food available to buy in between meals but best to bring a snack with you. Friendly helpful flight attendants huge luggage allowance (2 x 32 kilo bags) complimentary pillow blanket headphones eye mask and ear plugs: good selection of movies TV shows games and music.,8hawaiian-airlines,13/06/14,"Given health booked business class. Booked wheelchairs and meet and greets. Rang and triple checked on priority on luggage with assistance needed both in Australia and US. Imagine my horror when told flying business first time ever and nil afford told bring own food due to health issues. Spoke with them and sent world-wide advice on what we could take. Told first on first off. Not true. Wheelchair passengers had to sit while able bodied passengers got off first. Told wheelchair would be available would be pushed assistance with luggage - not true. Got sat in first row middle seats about two inches extra width and some silly ramp thing you can push down on and get feet up about 5"". Most uncomfortable seats ever. Told because of where we were sat and had no choice even though requested window seat our two backpacks had to be up top at all times so hubby was up and down to get medications food aides the entire flight. No wheelchair on arrival although pre-booked. And last off. Went from Honolulu to Kona no help with luggage consistently having to ask for help and tipping expected. Lounges disgusting at Kona. Return flight worse. All same as above. What did we get for business class prices! Nothing.",hawaiian-airlines,04/06/14,I have in my possession an itinerary and confirmation code along with a stated price of $177 for a flight from Hilo to Honolulu May 28 for my granddaughter's birthday. Aside from hellish service and customer service representatives on UAL DEN-LAX flight (see earlier review) this one about took the cake. When I went to check in at Hilo Hawaiian told me that had no reservation for me. They said that they sent some kind of message to me earlier. I have all my email and text messages for weeks before the flight and there was no contact. Eventually the only way to make the flight was to buy an upgraded ticket (from $177 to $303). Needless to say I'll never ever fly with Hawaiian Airlines again.,hawaiian-airlines,03/06/14,Trip Brisbane to Honolulu return - Economy class. My wife and I flew Hawaiian Airlines as they offer a direct flight from Brisbane. We flew in a Boeing 767 and found there seemed to be more leg room than some of the more recent aircraft. Service was good both ways.,8hawaiian-airlines,02/06/14,Flew Sydney to Honolulu then Honolulu to Las Vegas and back to Honolulu on A330 overall flights were good especially the international legs but the seats on the 330 are far too hard. The flight attendants were very good we then flew Honolulu to Brisbane on old 767 but actually this aircraft was very comfortable and would be my preference over the 330 every time.,6hawaiian-airlines,25/05/14,I flew to Honolulu from Sydney returning to Brisbane last week and was impressed with the onboard service. I was connecting from a internal flight to a Hawaiian Air flight and had a great welcome from desk staff which continued in the Air New Zealand Lounge. Great food and drink service with great amenities. On board the A320 the unique Hawaiian welcome on board set the ambience for a great fight. Food and drinks service and care was exceptional. The great experience with Hawaiian Air resumed on my return flight on a 767 to Brisbane. The friendly welcome from Hawaiian ground staff at the curb side at the Honolulu terminal until I got on board was terrific. My only disappointment was the Hawaiian Premier Lounge need to look at their code share airlines Virgin or Air NZ for a better standard. I felt I had the privilege of spending a further 10 hrs in Hawaii surrounded by the friendliness of Hawaiian culture. Good one Hawaiian Air ... I'll be back!,10hawaiian-airlines,23/05/14,Las Vegas to Honolulu round trip in first class. This was our first experience in first class and we were very pleased. Immediate friendly service before leaving Las Vegas. Very good food and plenty to drink. On the trip back the entertainment screen failed and a flight attendant dead heading back to Las Vegas helped me get it working. Again very good and friendly service from the crew. As this was our first time in first class I can't compare seats to other airlines or plane models; but our seats were very comfortable on the A 330. If we can afford it we would definitely do this again.,10hawaiian-airlines,16/05/14,Hawaiian is usually very good at customer service once you are on the plane but the process to get a seat or an upgrade is the worst that I have experienced in the 17 years that I have traveled for business. As a Platinum member I have vouchers for a complimentary upgrade to first class on flights from the mainland to Oahu. I am now on my 3rd year of travel to Hawaii and I have not been upgraded once. The process requires that you wait until 72 hours before the flight before they will consider an upgrade but most of the time First Class is sold out by that time. Even if it isn't sold out they will not allow any upgrades until the last minute in hopes of generating more revenue. The fact that they offer First Class to their Elite customers then put processes in place that makes it impossible to use it says that they really don't have anyone with any customer elations skills working at the corporate office. I fly to Hawaii 6 or 7 times a year and I would rather they didn't send me any type of upgrade certificate as a teaser if they are never going to let me use it.,6hawaiian-airlines,21/04/14,"Our first trip (OGG-SEA) on the new A330 with Hawaiian. We like the wide-body aircraft because when the two of us travel we can get a window and an aisle seat together. The seats on this plane are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in! The setback ""entertainment"" system is very slow and hard to navigate because one has to push hard on the screen for inputs to be recognized. I was afraid to push hard enough because it must have been annoying to the person in front of me. We had to miss the outbound SEA-OGG segment of this flight because of a change to our plans. I knew that we would not get anything back for that flight that we did not take but when we called HA to tell them that we would miss it they tried to collect $400 from us for change fees for the segment that we intended to keep. It has been our experience that the call center at HA is terrible and this was no exception. After 3 hours and no call we just went to the OGG airport where we were told that there was no change fee applicable.",3hawaiian-airlines,06/04/14,"Flew Beijing to Honolulu March 2014 in ""Business Class."" Definitely closer to economy plus. Uncomfortable barely reclining seats no electronics charging in-flight entertainment consists of iPads with a few games and movies/TV shows. Food was okay flight attendants brusque but efficient. They definitely don't seem like they enjoy their jobs. Would look hard for other options next time especially with Air China starting to fly that route.",5hawaiian-airlines,18/03/14,AKL/HNL + Maui and back. Flight up ok apart from seating at rear of cabin (we had paid for this trip in March). Poor food and expensive inflight entertainment. Maui to HNL my wife and I were seated in separate areas of the cabin! HNL to AKL seated even further apart. Seating arrangements Maui/HNL sorted by very helpful passenger service agent. Seating arrangement HNL/AKL sorted by paying additional $US75 each. Never again. Note we had booked and paid for this trip 6 months before flying.,hawaiian-airlines,11/03/14,Worst business class I have experienced. We flew from Sydney-Honolulu and Honolulu-Oakland and were shocked. The seats were terrible reclining just a little bit more than those in economy class and the food options for vegetarians were non-existent. We had informed them that we are vegetarian well in advance but when we reached the airport we were told that they don't have special meals for anyone even in business class so we'll have to make do with whatever they had. The lounge in Honolulu is shocking - no food just some juice and soft drinks. If you do have to fly Hawaiian do yourself a favor and save yourself a lot of money by flying economy - business class adds nothing.,1hawaiian-airlines,17/02/14,AKL-HNL-LAX on 13 Feb Business class: the AKL-HNL leg was on an A330 so the seats were very uncomfortable for a fairly long flight. The inflight entertainment was very basic. The staff seemed alright: even though they seemed to be very focused on 3 specific guests with whom they have been talking most of the time they were friendly and they did their job. The service is very casual anyway. HNL-LAX was on a newer plane: seats were bigger but not really reclining more of an easy chair than else. The inflight entertainment was via iPads as there were only communal screens. The chicken salad was really strange: the chicken was OK but it got served with some very gooey steamed rice and 2 (as in two) very hard strips of carrot. The lounge in HNL was a joke: the only refreshments offered were orange juice coffee and soft drinks from a dispenser eventually I was able to find some dry snacks by the reception counter (instead than at the 'bar'). The decor is very shabby. The only good thing was the wifi.,5hawaiian-airlines,03/02/14,Brisbane - Honolulu Boeing 767. Seat comfortable food ok. Departed on time and arrived on time. Honolulu - Sydney Airbus 330. Seat Rock hard (Standard Airbus) food oK dinner could have come about an hour earlier. It was served about 8 hours after lunch. Entertainment excellent. Departed 30 minutes late arrived 10 minutes late however did make for tight connection for Brisbane flight.,7hawaiian-airlines,16/01/14,We flew over to Honolulu on 8th January 2014 and was most uncomfortable flight I have been on. The flight entertainment was atrocious and we were told the entertainment was no longer available which I call false advertisement as they still claim the tablets are available. We are dreading the flight back to Sydney and will not be travelling with Hawaiian Airlines again. The airfares were not cheap either. Big mistake on our part.,1hawaiian-airlines,16/01/14,Went from New Zealand to Honolulu to JFK Return. Chose Hawaiian for the price. The staff seemed to be keen to help in the first 2 hours. Then it seemed that they were sleeping as it was hard to get service. My husband is blind and this was noted when booking but the staff were not very understanding compared to other airlines we have flown. Food marginal.,5hawaiian-airlines,09/01/14,"I fly monthly on Hawaiian and January is always a surprising month as they change services for the new year. This time HNL-PDX I flew coach exit row. No meal upgrade available like in 2013. Instead their complementary meal was a soggy bready carbohydrate laden terrible mess. It's as if Hawaiian said: let's do this on the cheap so we can say ""we're the only airline to offer complimentary meals from mainland to Hawaii"". I get PR but what I was served was like a slap in the customers face it was so horrible. I would pay the $15 for a more appetizing meal. The crew was as always excellent.",8hawaiian-airlines,03/01/14,Positive experience on short return hop between Honolulu and Kona. All flights on time. Baggage was not on plane on arrival in Kona but arrived on the next flight after a short wait. Staff was friendly and professional.,8hawaiian-airlines,30/12/13,San Diego - HNL - Hilo. Good service very welcoming staff small portions of food but good breakfast consisted of fruit crackers and cheese and macadamia chocolate. Later we were served a cocktail and chips which was lovely. Most entertainment has to be paid for and I think so has the earphones but I had my own entertainment. My one bugbear the recline of the seats are ridiculous with the travellers in front nearly on your knee more so than on any other airline I've flown with. Luckily they were very strict at meal times for seats to be upright. All in all a pleasant experience.,7hawaiian-airlines,17/12/13,HA451 13/12/13 business class seat 1G. On time boarding and departure and thankfully business class before children this time. As usual I was treated as a VIP due to my platinum status. Once onboard the business class cabin staff were outstanding they introduced themselves by name and learnt the customers names. The smiling faces of the 3 business class flight attendants was great - nothing was a bother for them. The food as usual on Hawaiian were great fish and veal with a very nice sweet for dessert plus dessert wines and liquors drinks flowed the whole way to Honolulu. After a sleep in the comfy armchair recliners style seats a big healthy breakfast was served about an hour out of Honolulu. One and only complaint this is an ongoing issue all of the bags marked first class priority were last off this problem always happens at Honolulu and in Sydney. Otherwise as usual great service and a highly professional team that needs acknowledged.,10hawaiian-airlines,16/12/13,First class from JFK to Honolulu. No more room than a normal domestic first class. Seats were manual recline and barely moved. I've never seen that before. No welcome kit. Food is a joke. Two choices tofu or ribs. 11 hour flight from hell with an equally poor entertainment system.,hawaiian-airlines,12/12/13,HNL to AKL. Very clean A330 with neat mood lighting throughout whole cabin. Nice food but no choice. Free drinks and snacks provided at the back during the flight. Crew we're very friendly. Movies not the latest but plenty to watch. Would fly again.,8hawaiian-airlines,12/12/13,My flight from JFK to LAX was 20 min late including the time it took to retrieve my luggage at baggage claim. The flight I had just arrived on was located right next to the gate I was to leave from to catch my Hawaii flight. When I got to the Hawaiian ticket counter to check my bag in for the flight I still had 40 minutes remaining before my flight would leave for Hawaii. To my surprise no one was there at the check in counter. I explained that I had a flight to Hawaii that leaves in 40 minutes and I asked to speak with a manager or supervisor to assist me. The only response they gave me was to go to the information booth which was downstairs and turned their backs on me and said â€œThere is nothing they could do!â€ùI went downstairs dragging my heavy luggage to ask for help at the information desk was told to call Hawaiian Airlines. I went back upstairs and there was a representative there. I explained my situation stating there was no one to check me in. I was told: There is nothing that he could do and the next flight is tomorrow! I was stranded and had nowhere to turn to at the time. I was offered no assistance at LAX airport. I ended up paying for the ticket having to change my return ticket because of their policies. Then they informed me about a reduction fee policy after I already paid an extra $200! Hawaiian Airlines computer system appears inefficient outdated and extremely slow. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again!,1hawaiian-airlines,04/12/13,Sydney to Honolulu return A330 brand new planes. Clean tidy interior with mood lighting. Lovely helpful friendly staff. Very reassuring when we hit what they said was severe turbulence on the way to Hawaii. Kept us well informed of what was happening. Food pretty good for airline food and drinks aplenty. Always smiling. Flights all on time. Would definitely be my choice of airline flying to Hawaii or Americas again.,10hawaiian-airlines,25/11/13,Flight from Sydney to Hawaii was fantastic the service could not have been better. Staff were very friendly and helpful the children had plenty of entertainment and the adults had plenty to watch all free. The leg from Hawaii to LAX was not what we had experienced in the first leg of the trip. The plane was freezing so I asked for a blanket and it was going to cost me $10us dollars. You also had to pay for the entertainment we had just flown from Australia and they wanted more money. We were not happy same again on the LAX to Hawaii - freezing but the leg from Hawaii to Australia very comfortable.,5hawaiian-airlines,15/11/13,Honolulu to SF First Class. Excellent service very good food. Only complaint is that the first class seats on the A330 are just not that comfortable especially when not reclined. 767 is more comfortable and the rest room is larger! All in all a nice experience.,9hawaiian-airlines,14/11/13,A couple of weeks back we had to cut short our trip due to a family members health deteriorating rapidly we were in Kauai and needed to get back to Sydney pronto. Hawaiian were accommodating on getting us on a flight but charged us both for entirely 2 new one way air fares ( AUD2200) - talk about slugging you whilst you are down - absolutely no compassion at all. Other family member were in the UK and Emirates/Qantas did all they could to get them home in time which they did and did all of this free of charge - we've flown with Hawaiian in the past but this has left a very very poor taste in our collective mouths. IF we can at all help it will not be flying Hawaiian again.,2hawaiian-airlines,14/11/13,We flew for the first time with Hawaiian airlines from Brisbane on 767 to Hawaii then onto Vegas. We upgraded to business class on flight from Brisbane to Hawaii the night before on online check in for discounted price - worth it. Lounge at Brisbane airport is AirNZ and was great. Staff on ground very helpful food great we paid extra for bulkhead seat from Vegas to Hawaii - again worth it plenty of leg room. I found every aspect of the flights great.,9hawaiian-airlines,14/11/13,Most uncomfortable seats on any flight I've ever experienced. Very cold on the flight no blankets or pillows offered on this OAK-OGG flight. Meal is a joke! Brunch consisted of 2 small slices of cantaloupe 2 small slices of mushy watermelon 2 very hard slices of unripe honeydew melon 4 grapes 4 crackers one piece of cheese and one chocolate covered macadamia nut candy. When leaving home at 6:00 a.m. with two hour advance check-in before a 5:33 flight don't assume Hawaiian is offering a meal as their advertising reports; eat first take food on the plane. Take a jacket to wear on the flight. Very tight leg room uncomfortable uncushioned hard seats. They are the only airline that I know of that charges for ear phones. Could have brought my own if I knew they are not included. Poor quality entertainment choices. If you want to starve freeze and suffer through a long flight fly HA otherwise choose a different carrier.,3hawaiian-airlines,07/11/13,BNE-HNL return Business although not fully flat the recliner seats are very comfy food and beverages excellent as well as the staff. Inflight entertainment on the 767er not so good but the service made up for it. As previously mentioned the lounge in HNL really needs upgrading we walked in used the restroom and walked out.,9hawaiian-airlines,20/10/13,I flew HA436 first class from SYD to HNL on 12th October on a brand new A330 and had a very good experience - attentive crew - great food preparation and meal and beverage service and good in-flight entertainment. The only drawback was the lack of a lie flat bed for a 9 hour flight-the seat was comfortable but if HA pulled out those cradle type seats in First and removed the economy seats in the second smaller cabin and installed lie flat beds in both cabins they would have a great product and sweep away their competition.,8hawaiian-airlines,16/10/13,Hilo to Sydney via Honolulu. Web check in went well purchased preferred seats for Honolulu to Sydney cost $75 seat 14B. Hilo to Honolulu HA 121 8.50am departure seat 1B first class. Lounge at Hilo very basic free wifi coffee and soft drink. Pre boarding done correctly on time departure quick 50 minute flight just enough time for a coffee and a biscuit. Honolulu to Sydney HA 451 seat 14B the reserved seating bulk head seat cost $75 extra. Boarding called in correct order except kids get priority again. My bulk head seat was as spacious as an economy seat can be. I would have preferred the seats in row 11 but they were blocked for the entire 24 hour period during check in. Not long after take off a very friendly stewardess offered drinks and 2 hours into flights refills and dinner served would give this food a 4 out of 5 for economy. There was a lot of young families traveling with babies all were reasonably behaved for a 10 hour flight. There of course was one family who thought it was ok for their children to play a portable DVD player without head phones so all the cabin could hear it.,7hawaiian-airlines,07/10/13,5th October SYD-HNL-ITO. This is my 10th year as a dedicated Hawaiian air traveller for long distance trip SYD to HNL and Hilo also to LA and Vegas also started to use their HNL to JFK this year and looking forward to their expansion with new aircraft purchase planned. Today's trip started on 4th October at 2000 when I attempted to use the web check in 24 hours prior with no success. I am lucky I am a gold Pualani member so I called their dedicated line after about 25 minutes they were able to upgrade my SYD-HNL flight and my HNL-Hilo which is good as business on Hawaiian is normally very good. 5th October check in was a breeze with the dedicated business and Pualani member line and with express pass through immigration I was In the Air New Zealand lounge in no time. This Air NZ lounge has improved over the past few years it was getting tired and food mediocre. But gladly today much better I really like the self help bar. My flight is scheduled for 2000 departure I noticed in bound flight arrived on time. Boarding started on time and again children first before business - this always annoys me. Once onboard was offered welcome champagne or juice the seats are wide leather seats but don't lie flat but are still very comfortable and they have power for your iPad or iPhone. Take off on time and as soon as we levelled off drinks started to flow I had a few chivas regals and before dinner there also was a cheese plate. 3 options for dinner I had the veal and catch of the day and it was fantastic. Breakfast was strawberry yoghurt fresh fruit plate country style potatoes and crab and scallion omelette also fantastic. The cabin crew were very attentive and professional I managed to get a good couple of hours sleep and rested for my next flight HNL to Hilo. Got through customs fairly fast but maybe they could looking into express path for business passengers like in Sydney. At the transfer desk no Hawaiian staff there to send my bags to Hilo so had to take them to the inter island terminal myself. Once there was easy to drop off bags and head to the priority security line. Honolulu to Hilo again seat 1B a quick 50 minute flight no problems arrived on time and bags were quickly available. Over all a 5 star trip very pleased and look forward to many more Hawaiian trips.,10hawaiian-airlines,03/10/13,"San Francisco-Honolulu-San Francisco in September 2013. Outbound Flight HA11 boarded on time boarding was organized flight left and arrived on time. Newish Airbus A330-200's economy cabin was stylish and comfortable. Basic IFE offered little entertainment you have to pay extra for movies and TV programs. Not a problem for me and my wife as we brought our own respective iPads. The outbound basic ""free"" meal consisted of a fruit tray a cookie a Hawaiian chocolate candy in a wrapper water and juice or soda. Upgraded meal was $14 for a hamburger or a Chicken salad with a few extras on the meal tray but we felt those were not good values for their prices therefore we bought two sandwiches in the airport before our flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and they offered free Mai Tais and Hawaiian chips about one hour before landing in HNL. Total of three drink runs during the 5 1/2-hour flight. Return flight HA12 also with organized boarding left and arrived on time. Nothing new to say about the Airbus A330-200's IFE except this particular airplane's moving map display has an added information on the airplane's flight level in meters and feet. Surprised we were given ""free"" in-flight meal of Chicken- stuffed hot sandwich with a small salad and Hawaiian chocolate candy a free cup of wine was an option! This was very much appreciated. Again three drink runs during this 4 1/2-hour flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. With HA's convenient departure and arrival times and newer Airbus A330-200 aircraft's used on the SFO- HNL-SFO routes we will fly with them again next time we visit the Hawaiian Islands.",8hawaiian-airlines,02/10/13,Flew Business Class Sydney to Honolulu. Complete rip off. Seats do not convert to beds the plane was old and outdated the food was terrible and they don't even have a wine list. For a snack we were not offered but had to ask and it was a bag of chips or a cookie in Business Class. Uniforms are as ugly as the plane and the service was shocking. I will never fly on Hawaiian again.,hawaiian-airlines,30/09/13,SYD-HNL. My mother and I had high hopes. We were quite disappointed starting from the moment we entered the plane. Cabin Crew appeared disinterested and not polite. The food was by far the most terrible we have ever had on any flight. It was quite safe to say that Hawaiian Airlines food service onboard HA452 and HA451 was disgusting. On both legs no vegetarian option was given and we were given hard cold chicken with undercooked vegetables. It was a terrible way to start a flight and it certainly did not get any better as the long night flight became unusually extremely cold to the point that others were questioning it too! The cabin temperature served countless chills that made it hard to sleep.,4hawaiian-airlines,17/09/13,SFO to HNL (7 Sep) HNL to/from Lihue (09/10 Sep) and final sector on HA445 to Auckland (13 Sep). Per my previous post this airline could be good. Pluses: new A330 aircraft flights on time decent 2 piece 70 lb baggage allowance for international pax the crew on the final four sectors were much more enthusiastic in serving their passengers (HA445 in particular) the web check-in and bag drop at all airports worked well. The pluses end there. Minuses: For international passengers the food/beverage and inflight entertainment is dire. Can see why US passengers might rate them highly given what they endure domestically! What's with the bland chicken and rice dishes on all lunch and dinner flights? The free F+B offering on SFO-HNL breakfast run consists of 4 grapes 4 slices of melon a piece of cheese and 2 packs of crackers? HA should charge a couple of bucks more and get serious with their offerings or drop the pretence of food completely and charge for a decent offering. The 'complimentary IFE' is a joke in content despite the new A330 planes even the pay per view movies (US$7.99 a pop) were exceedingly limited in choice. The HA terminal in HNL and terminal in LIH are in a time warp but suspect this to be the fault of the airport authorities (and TSA is certainly outside HA's control). Like I said all's not lost this airline certainly is no 4/5 star airline but it could be halfway decent with a few weeks. For the price paid not really good value. A shame as actually had been looking forward to flying them to and from SFO. Could only recommend HA only if price substantially cheaper than other options.,7hawaiian-airlines,15/09/13,I flew from Oakland to Maui on Sep 11. I arrived at the airport at 6am 2 hours before departure. Check-in was a breeze with friendly staff despite the early time of the day. The fee to check in a 45-lb suitcase was $25 (quite standard nowadays). I have flown on many Boeing 767's and this one was by far the quietest one ever. Flight attendants were very friendly. The complimentary breakfast after take-off and the complimentary rum punch before landing are a really nice touch when flying in the economy cabin. I can only think of two draw-backs: 1) your regular head-sets don't work well (you need a two-prong plug or you only hear their [free] video entertainment out of one ear]) and 2) the cabin is very cold (I was prepared and wore my coat but several folks around me were sneezing). Overall: a very good experience!,9hawaiian-airlines,13/09/13,I have flown Hawaiian Airlines about 20 times now Oakland to either Hilo or Kona last trip was March 2013. As far as I'm concerned there is no other like it. I wish they flew all over the Continental US. Fantastic service on the ground and in the plane. If flights were more than half off with other airlines I wouldn't go I'm staying with Hawaiian.,10hawaiian-airlines,27/08/13,Travelled AKL to SFO via HNL on 24 Aug. HA446/12. Had been warned not to expect much and this was sage advice. Web check-in and bag drop was a good start for a 23.55 hr departure. Crew on HA446 distinctly lacking aloha. HA12 better. Meals the same bland poached chicken bits on rice with broccoli (ex AKL) and diced carrots/peas (exHNL). Not worth staying up for esp when served at 2 am out of AKL! Breakfast was a plastic bag of assorted industrial foods handed to pax. Inflight entertainment despite being touchscreen on newish A330 was lacking content and not free (US$7.99 a movie). Budget airline without the budget ticket prices in future its back to Air NZ. Pluses: I arrived SFO on time and with both checked bags. HA actually has the potential to be a very good airline but needs to think hard about its international offering.,5hawaiian-airlines,19/08/13,HNL-SFO in first class. I used Hawaiians drive-thru check-in at HNL and was berated by very unfriendly agent because my friend just dropped me off and then left with the car. Her reasoning it is a drive-thru check-in not a drop-off. When I requested a priority tag for my suitcase agent requested a tip for the porter. I gave the porter a tip but still did not get a priority tag. No information given about lounge access had to find lounge on my own. Overall a very chaotic unfriendly check-in process. Lounge at HNL airport very basic staff ok not overly friendly. On board the service was good and so was the food and wine. The seats however have only minimal recline and were not very comfortable in the upright position. Overall ok for a 5 hr flight but longer flights would be a problem. I used miles for my first class flight and got an ok deal. Otherwise not worth the premium.,4hawaiian-airlines,07/08/13,HA444 from Brisbane to Honolulu on Sunday 4th August. Returning Saturday 17th August on flight HA443. Budget airline would never fly them again. Service 5 out of 10 Seating 2 out of 10 take a jacket as you will freeze! No in seat movie screens. On international flight unless you buy a machine. Other options would be better!,2hawaiian-airlines,05/08/13,If you are flying coach w/o elite status Hawaiian Airlines is great because they you are their target market. I have flown Hawaiian many times between Las Vegas and Hawaii most recently just a few days ago. Here is what I like: 1) A decent seat pitch of 32 inches is standard 2) seating on the transpacific planes is 2-4-2 so a husband and wife can get a window aisle seat by themselves 3) nice free meals in coach 4) they actually answer the phone reasonably quickly by airline standards 5) the flight attendants are actually friendly.,10hawaiian-airlines,31/07/13,LAX to HNL in First bumped onto Hawaiian due to American Airlines flight going tech. Great new Airbus aircraft clean bright and fresh fantastic staff friendly very out going nice pre take off drinks great Menu and Catering Wine choice was very limited and The Seat is terribly uncomfortable but overall I think Hawaiian have a great little niche and are the best of the American Carriers.,8hawaiian-airlines,30/07/13,HNL-SFO. Self-service check-in quick although not enough personnel to help through the relatively complex system. Bags are weighed and you even self-tag the bags before dropping it off. Potentially efficient but the communication needs to be better. However the extra charges are ridiculous on Hawaiian. Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service. Next time I am bringing my own food on-board and flying Delta!,3hawaiian-airlines,30/07/13,Oakland - Maui - Kona. An excellent experience from start to finish. Great service punctuated by smiles and efficiency. A delicious breakfast was served with a small cheese plate offered before landing. The other carriers on these Hawaiian routes should take notes about first class service and offerings. Easy transfer in Maui to a short efficient hop to Kona.,10hawaiian-airlines,29/07/13,Returned from Honolulu to Sydney Fri 26th July. Business Class was a shambles checking in. There was no one at the desk and a queue was building. A girl finally appeared and was so slow and uninterested we asked another guy who was assisting economy people get their own baggage labels in a machine and finally he assisted us. Really disappointed after paying so much. A330 seats not very comfortable and my video machine did not work. The staff were very friendly and couldn't fault them but would not fly again with them.,2hawaiian-airlines,21/07/13,Honolulu-Seattle-Maui First Class. Although somehow skimpier than it was in past years the experience was generally very good. Smiling truly friendly attendants comfortable (767) seating and decent food are the mainstay of Hawaiians First Class mainland service and they delivered. The aircraft is old but very comfortable. Digi players are annoying and clumsy to use but provide a fair amount of entertainment on this particular route. Somehow the meals seemed a little less robust than before but were tasty. All in all at the head of the pack certainly for travel to and from Hawaii and perhaps domestically altogether.,9hawaiian-airlines,18/07/13,SYD-HNL return. Sydney to Honolulu - Check in staff very efficient. Friends travelling to Honolulu night before and went to service desk to ask about window seats. The man at the desk said that we were currently sitting in the middle of the aircraft and he would try to get us window seats as the flight was full. Arrived at the airport next day to check in and was assigned window seats. Cabin crew were very friendly. All of them smiling. Cabin very clean and comfortable. New A330 aircraft. Pillow and blanket provided. Food was good. Very good portion sizes. Cabin crew regularly came through the cabin offering water to passengers. Other drinks were available from the galley upon request. Range of TV's and movies available to watch. Over movies were available for a fee. Smooth flight. Honolulu to Sydney - Printed out boarding pass previous day and had chosen seats then. This time in the middle of the aircraft. Used self serve kiosks to weigh and print out bag tags. Also printed out new boarding passes. Very efficient process. Again a friendly crew. Meal service was good again. This time sitting in the middle of the aircraft there seemed to be more legroom. Cabin crew kept offering water during the flight. The Pau Hana Snack bar was open during the flight. Staff very friendly and efficient. However 1 cabin crew member did not seem as if she wanted to be there. All other cabin crew were great.,10hawaiian-airlines,23/06/13,Honolulu-Kona-Honolulu. B717. A real shame. Hawaiian is taking profit of its monopoly. Our United Airlines flight from Tokyo arrived much earlier and therefore we decided to travel immediately to Kona on already booked tickets. A bad humored attendant decided that we should pay US$50 and not US$30 each. We had also to pay for checked-in luggage (US$17) each. As one was 2 pounds over the permission I had to transfer clothes to the hand luggage. Ridiculous. Plus: flight was 90% empty + service was a warn cup of coffee with a soup taste. Note that our return flight was delayed 1hour and a half with no apologizes whatsoever even not from Captain.,hawaiian-airlines,19/06/13,My friend and I both took our 9 month old sons to Hawaii. Staff on flight were not helpful at all. We asked if they would wash our bottles for us being our hands are tied with the babies and they pointed to the restrooms. Asked for help with our carry on we were actually turned away. Both going and back the flight and staff were not accommodating to us fellow passengers were more of a help.,3hawaiian-airlines,11/06/13,Hilo to Sydney via Honolulu 10th June. Hilo check in was quick bags booked all the way to Sydney. I still get the lounge due to gold status. Hilo to Honolulu seat 7b 8.50am flight left on time pleasant crew. At Honolulu lounge access again basic wifi coffee soft drinks. No food or snacks available and lounge is a long walk from international gates. Honolulu to Sydney business HA451 seat 1H. Boarding procedures were business and wheelchairs first as it should be then children and pualani gold and platinum. Plane left on time clean and new airbus welcoming crew. After take off spicy crab sushi with pickled ginger and cocktails 45 minutes after take off. Dinner was salmon in rice paper Himalayan rice with macadamia nut pesto and salad - very impressed. Desert was Ice cream truffle strawberry sorbet. Cocktails constant and staff attentive. Before arrival a Hawaiian style high tea was served. Arrival as usual. Due to the airbus only utilizes one door business must walk back through economy to get off so not first off the plane but we are given priority customs forms to fast track forms through customs and immigration. Bags are tagged first class priority and come through very quick. My only complaint is Sydney airport customs they give you an express path ticket when in business and first and that line was huge at Sydney. Overall a great flight and always recommend Hawaiian to all USA destinations.,10hawaiian-airlines,03/06/13,Flight HA17 Las Vegas to Honolulu 1 June 13 1.55am red eye. Disappointed no Hawaiian lounge for members at Las Vegas airport security was fast. Seat 14d bulkhead seat at $25 extra is worth it. Boarding was chaos people had to fight to the front to get in as a Pualani gold member. At Las Vegas they do boarding differently wheelchairs first children then first followed by platinum then gold. Once on board I had an annoying kid kicking my seat continually parents not stopping it until I said something. After take off I settled into a nice sleep lights all turned down for people to rest. Drinks were served and free soft drinks and coffee towards landing. Arrival in Honolulu was on time and deplaned 4.45am. Crew friendly and attentive not much involvement as it was an over night flight.,8hawaiian-airlines,30/05/13,Las Vegas - HNL on a 767-300. Staff on the flight were very good with plenty of genuine smiles and offers of assistance. Food and drink offerings were as expected as most options are at a cost. I paid for a digi player and it was ok to pass the time on this 6+ hr sector and found it ok but the selections were a bit limited and in most cases fairly out of date which was disappointing. The real downside was the fact that blankets are not offered and must be bought which would be ok but they hold a very small stock which sold quickly and the cabin was freezing. Fine for the staff who had jackets to wear but for a plane load of people leaving one hot destination for another this isn't good as most people were in shorts and t-shirts.,7hawaiian-airlines,30/05/13,Hilo to HNL 26 May 13 HA 311 Seats 6A. Check-in early and easy in Hilo booked all the way to Vegas. Very basic lounge in Hilo for 1st class and premier club members. Flight on time free juice or water available on 50 minute flight. HNL to Las Vegas HA 8 Seat 29B. Take off on time very packed flight. Cocktail hour started not long after take off and I was informed that Pualani Gold no longer get 2 free cocktails a little disappointing for a 5 hour flight. Pillows and blankets were ok for Economy. Staff appeared to be nice friendly and relaxed they were always walking around to make sure everyone had what they wanted - no request went unanswered. Flight delayed 45 minutes dues to head winds.,8hawaiian-airlines,28/05/13,SYD-HNL HA 436 20.00 flight depart SYD on time Seat 1B. USB power available. Check-in smooth friendly and personal as you would expect for a Pualani Gold Member. Air New Zealand lounge for drinks and snacks a little over crowded. In bound plane arrived on time. Boarding is always a push and shove in Sydney and they start with children which annoys me Business or First should go first. After being seated champagne was nice but rushed. Only 9 people in business and 3 flight attendants so good service. After take off hot towels and customs forms handed out. Tables set for cheese biscuits and cocktails served. Staff friendly and professional. Dinner served less than 1 hour into the flight. I had steak and pumpkin ravioli and it was very nice. Lights turned down and window shades closed. Bathroom nice laid out with amenities. Sleep as always is hard for me the seats are not lie flat but are still comfortable leather recliners. Breakfast served an hour out of Honolulu. In Honolulu only had 1 hour 15 minutes to make it through customs and my next flight I made it through customs in 15 mins. Overall a great flight and what I have come to expect from Hawaiian business class.,10hawaiian-airlines,27/05/13,"KOA-OGG-LIH-HNL. We made 3 inter island flights with Hawaiian on our vacation (3 persons). Flights were almost on time. Staff helpful and friendly. Only a drink service (fruit juice) on the short flights (30min). Planes (B717) clean and with a special ""Hawaiian fragrance"" in the cabin. Good value for the money.",9hawaiian-airlines,20/05/13,"Arrive at Kennedy for a flight going from New York to Oahu. Only then do we find luggage is $25 a bag more. We were going to see my son in the Marines stationed at Oahu. I tried to see if I could get my veteran's discount and was declined. I later asked if active military would be able to get a discount. I was told they used to do it but stopped. On our tickets it said lunch and supper. However supper turned out just to be a snack (crackers and cheese). No complimentary movie even though the flight is 11 hours long. The straw that broke the camel's back was the return trip. My son wanted to see us off. As active military almost every airline will give him a gate pass to see us off. He showed his ID and security instructed us to get to the counter and get a pass for him. We had to wait in a rebagging line a half hour. When we finally got to the counter I stated that we needed to get a pass for him. The woman said ""Passes are only for the handicapped and seniors."" At that point I flipped she issued him a pass and told me the I have to understand this is for security reasons. Never again.",hawaiian-airlines,19/05/13,HNL-OGG-KOA-HNL. Three separate legs during a vacation on B717.Very good service on these short trips all on time.,10hawaiian-airlines,06/05/13,My husband and I flew to Honolulu stayed for 6 days then flew on to San Francisco. From being able to check-in online choose or change our seats online to the overall appearance of the plane to the staff etc it was a great experience. I am vegetarian and they do not cater specifically for us so took some food on board. Our seats were good not quite as much leg room as other airlines but sufficient. Baggage allowance was fantastic. Left and arrived on time. Coming back from SF to NZ was a different story. We had extra luggage so we did a manual check in there were issues with the computer system as it was new. Staff were great. Boarded on time then the Captain announced there were problems after 2 hours on the tarmac we disembarked. Captain kept us well informed. Missed our connecting flights. Once again the staff were great. They re-booked all of us gave us generous food vouchers organised free trolleys for our luggage and had them waiting for us when we went to collect our luggage. A pretty good experience and we would recommend them.,9hawaiian-airlines,04/05/13,Sydney to LA LA to Las Vegas Las Vegas to Hawaii and due to fly back to Sydney tomorrow. We have had nothing but problems. We have a 1 year old and do not expect special treatment however I do expect a level of service which should come with paying the fare. We have to pay $75 extra for a bulk head seat however for all 4 flights have been unable to do this due to a technical problem which they tell us has something to do with travelling with an infant however can't tell us how to overcome this. The majority of the hostesses are rude and not helpful at all. We received no information from them in regards to seatbelt safety etc when it came to our daughter and had to ask. The last thing as a parent you want to do is inconvenience other passengers however they make flying with a child horrific as once again we are unable to book and pay for the bulk head seats through web check in. They had the cheek to tell us that the only way they could help us was for on our last day to catch a cab to the airport and check in that way. We told them it would cost us 130 dollars round trip and we couldn't with our one year old and they couldn't care less. They are a disgrace. I will never ever fly them again and if you are thinking of booking your holiday with them don't.,2hawaiian-airlines,02/05/13,SYD-HNL in April. Pretty ordinary service sarcastic staff member and were inattentive. When we needed extra blankets for all of us 2 adults and a child the crew member said they never have enough blankets and I had to go and find someone. He was uninterested and wasn't going to even look for one. My husband found a couple as the cabin was absolutely freezing. The flight was not full so having extra seats were good but the food was really ordinary too. One meal was OK but not great. Movies at a cost. We paid a good price for the ticket so was very disappointing.,4hawaiian-airlines,23/04/13,Flew SAN to OGG with layovers at HNL both legs. All flights left and arrived early. We were even able to take an earlier connecting flight from OGG to HNL for no extra charge. Service was friendly but not outstanding.,8hawaiian-airlines,18/04/13,Quick flights between HNL-OGG and KOA. Very pleasant airline. Smiling crew. Efficient boarding resulting in very punctual departures. Beverages were offered: a lot of efforts are put in these very short flights. Can't wait to try them on longer route! Hawaiian airlines should consider flying to Vancouver!,9hawaiian-airlines,04/04/13,"My wife and I got married on Kauai and honeymooned on Maui. Flew Hawaiian Airlines the entire way. On the return we inquired about changing our flight so we would not have a 3-hour layover in Honolulu. The woman at the counter informed us there may be a small fee. 20 minutes later she informed us it would cost $650 per person to change our flight. She was attempting to sell us new tickets at day-of prices and subtracting what we had already paid for our current tickets. She handed us back our ticket vouchers with ""OC"" written on them. It seems she unblocked our hand picked seats we reserved 6 months ago in order to investigate changing our tickets. The ""OC"" stands for overcharge and we no longer had seats on the flight from Honolulu to Portland. This was a 6 hour flight and comfortable seats were important. Got off the plane in Honolulu. Told we needed to speak to the ticket agent at the departing gate. He did find us seats on the flight but they were at the back. Supervisor eventually gave us emergency exit row seats. The real shame is Hawaiian used to be better than the other airlines but now they nickle and dime you with hidden costs just like all the rest.",hawaiian-airlines,04/04/13,HNL to INC. Flight was not full so there were empty seats. Plane was a very old 767 that was showing its age. Run down and torn seats my table tray still had crumbs and gravy stains and my seat volume control was broken as was the overhead monitor screens. Cabin staff treated passengers like cattle. The only smiles I saw from the flight attendants were when they tandem delivered drinks and meals joking loudly with each other as if the passengers didn't matter. During the noodle service the 2 male flight attendants were in such a rush that they shoved the noodle cup in our laps even though some passengers didn't have their tray down. The service did resemble the price I paid. On the upside the meal was tasty and plentiful and the trip back from Fukuoka to HNL was completely opposite.,3hawaiian-airlines,25/03/13,"Flew Hawaiian for the first time from San Francisco to Honolulu in coach with some trepidation given previous reviews. On checking in online exit row seats (window/aisle) in a 2-4-2 layout were available at 35 bucks each. Well worth the money especially as priority boarding was thrown in to the price. Bag drop was slow but bags helpfully tagged through to Molokai. Well organised boarding on a completely full flight plus the priority boarding meant that overhead bin space wasn't an issue (though it was for others who boarded later). An on time departure and a very thorough briefing on our role at the emergency exit set a positive tone for the flight. A ""continental breakfast"" (but more like a snack box) with a sweet roll with cream cheese savoury snack bag and a cookie plus T&Cs and juice was served promptly. A second round of T&Cs and a later water run were offered and unexpected. An hour or so out of Honolulu a further drinks run with T&Cs and complimentary mai tai were offered concluding a cabin service which was good and delivered by friendly and professional crew. All in all - cheaper than other N American carriers by a fair amount with a good level of service I wasn't expecting.",9hawaiian-airlines,18/03/13,Short OGG-KOA island hop flight in a Boeing 717. Chose HA over others since preferred to be in a jet rather than smaller turboprop. Rather chaotic check-in process but that could be the fault of the airport and once past that it was all good. We had aisle and window seats with one person in between us. Didn't feel cramped. We had tried to upgrade to first the day before (you can to it at a reduced charge 24 hours in advance) but fc seats already filled. No matter. Didn't see that much of a difference. And for such a short flight economy was just fine.,7hawaiian-airlines,13/03/13,SEA-HNL in a B767. Upgraded to first class at check-in. Seats more business class than first. Service from cabin crew excellent. Food was edible plenty of snacks and drinks available. IFE was a joke. Digi player was old and content the same!,9hawaiian-airlines,04/03/13,We flew Sydney to HNL - Sydney on their new A330. The seats were very uncomfortable like sitting on bricks for 9.5 hours and 10.5 coming back the service was terrible and the staff don't smile. Food was ok drink service terrible entertainment - they wanted $8.00 for a movie. Next time we will pay extra and go Qantas.,hawaiian-airlines,20/02/13,My husband and I flew HA Brisbane to Honolulu Business Class Flight 444 6 Feb 2013. Boeing 767. The cost was Return $7483 Aus. The plane had the oldest most uncomfortable seats I have ever been on. The only good thing about the flight was it was direct Brisbane to Honolulu. I was seated in Seat 2b. The flight on the way home was a newer Boeing 767. I was seated in 1A and it was better. Hawaiian Airlines should not say these are Business Class Seats. Service on the way to Honolulu left much to be desired. It was better on the way Home to Brisbane.,hawaiian-airlines,12/02/13,This is my second trip with Hawaiian Airlines. Both times were first class the most recent flight being 01/08/2013 HA 51 JFK to HNL. Flight Crew was very nice. The food was very good even though a touch fancy for my taste. One complaint though why should they charge a first class passenger an overweight fee for a bag.,9hawaiian-airlines,31/01/13,I wasn't expecting much because my ticket from Honolulu to LA was only $172! After flying from Auckland to Honolulu and receiving nothing but water I was bowled over when we were given a complimentary snack box beverages and even a complimentary mai-tai. The entertainment required a 10 dollar fee and since I did not have my own headset an additional 3 dollars bought a headset. The attendants were lukewarm.,7hawaiian-airlines,30/01/13,LAS-HNL-ITO. It is amazing how things change over 12 months. At LAS there are too few check-in staff. Bag drop amazingly can take 30 minutes. So much for on-line check-in and printing boarding passes. On board they still have A330s with seat back screens but that is about all. The choice of viewing available without payment is pathetic. There is no longer even a snack provided for what is quite a long flight instead they want you to buy dismal snacks from the back galley. There is the walk between terminals at HNL and then a fair short flight to Hawaii. Coming back we paid for first class on the short flight. That was good. Bags flew free and Mai Tais are available. The main flight? Dire. No food screens keep trying to get money. I am through with HA. There is no difference now between HA and other carriers I will just use the best schedule at the best price.,1hawaiian-airlines,25/01/13,HNL-KON-OGG-HNL. Inter-island service is fantastic very comfortable. Every time we were asked by check-in staff whether we wanted emergency exit as I am very tall whilst flights are short as soon as we took off a tasty local fruit drink was offered. I was so impressed I will try them long haul next time hopefully they add Melbourne to their Brisbane and Sydney destinations in Australia.,9hawaiian-airlines,25/01/13,BNE-HNL-SEA. Check-in at BNE was easily the slowest I have experienced anywhere - terrible. The check-in staff at BNE are obviously local contractors who couldn't even tell me if I needed to change terminals at Honolulu ! Very poor directions from ground staff at HNL as to how to get to domestic flight. Aircraft was clean comfortable and seat space seemed quite OK. Staff on board are excellent and very friendly. Ground staff need a good shaking up. Meals only so-so. Lousy in-flight entertainment I simply didn't bother. I would fly again if they could trim their prices a bit but if cabin staff should ever fail me I wouldn't be back.,8hawaiian-airlines,18/01/13,"JFK-HNL-JHM-HNL-JFK. Excellent trip in all respects. JFK-HNL leg was on a new A330. Economy seats are 32"" pitch more than most US carriers. That extra inch makes a difference on a 10-11 hour flight. Two free meals were served by hard-working and attentive staff along with several drink services. Yes the first bag cost $35 but Hawaiian checked it through from JFK to West Maui even though that flight was on Island Air and I never touched the luggage until I reached my final destination. I enjoyed these flights so much that I have already reserved another JFK-HNL-KOA-HNL-JFK trip for this coming July. Since I booked so early I was able to snag row 13 which is in the small quiet section behind Business Class.",9hawaiian-airlines,09/01/13,My wife and I flew BNE-HNL-BNE 767 just prior to Christmas and returned early January 2013. Flights were on time and staff efficient and helpful. The service side is a let down they say we are a full service airline but there is no choice with meals and very limited drinks service. The seats are reasonable for someone my size 6ft 2 but I would like better entertainment than a digiplayer. If we were planning on returning to Honolulu I would think about upgrading to business.,5hawaiian-airlines,08/01/13,SYD-HNL-OGG-HNL-SYD in December 2012. A330-200 between Sydney and Honolulu and B717 between Honolulu and Maui. All flights on time. On A330 I would advise taking the $75 upgrade to a bulkhead seat - particularly row 11 as its right behind Business class and in a mini cabin of only 3 rows. If travelling overnight I'd pay for economy and upgrade on check-in online to Business if available. Best thing about the flights was the excellent service and the prompt appearance of baggage at the carousel. Food was good drinks plentiful. Pay TV option was a bit much but we read. I joined their FF program before I booked - for only $120 it was worth it! Business check-in express pass through customs lounge access it's kind of like the Qantas Club. You also get priority boarding which was very useful. Hawaiian's aircraft on the Sydney to Honolulu route are all brand new A330s.,9hawaiian-airlines,08/01/13,OAK-OGG-KOA KOA-OGG-SJC. This was my first experience on Hawaiian and it may very well be my last. On the Maui-San Jose flight Hawaiian screened a movie featuring graphic violence on the big screen in front of a crowd that included numerous young children. Hawaiian cancelled our flight rebooked us with a ridiculous routing involving two plane changes and neglected to inform us. I only discovered this when I went on-line to check the flight time. In the process of shifting our itinerary Hawaiian messed up the seat assignments and split up our family. Correcting these mistakes cost me considerable time.,2hawaiian-airlines,08/01/13,Easily the most uncomfortable flight I have taken in the last 40 years. Seat pitch is so tight I was just barely able to hold the inflight magazine between my chest and the seatback in front of me and I am not oversized. Fortunately they are usually on time the crews are pleasant enough and bags are delivered quickly. Would never fly this carrier again if there were another way to get from HNL to the other islands. Their seating brings new meaning to the phrase cattle car.,3hawaiian-airlines,23/12/12,Flight from Seattle to Honolulu in an old Boeing 767 which was 26 years old. Crew was nice but service was normal. Seats were broken and legroom was ok lavatories showed their age and had a bad smell. Free food service that is not normal on us-carriers. Food was enough and the quality was fair. Took some time in Honolulu until we reached the gate almost 20 minutes after landing.,6hawaiian-airlines,23/12/12,Flight from Honolulu to Maui and return. Flight was on an B717 which is a nice plane. Crew was very friendly and had a smile. Seating was better than on older 767. Juice was served shortly after take-off. They offered maps with sights of Maui for free. Baggage was soon on belt. Good job for a short flight like this.,8hawaiian-airlines,23/12/12,Airbus 330 flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas. Aircraft had new AVOD but they charge for movies. Free dinner was served with rice beef and veggies. Crew came around with water and juice during flight. Flight on time and seating in the new aircraft is very good. Check in kiosk did not work so we had to do it with staff together.,7hawaiian-airlines,19/12/12,Wife and I flew from Las Vegas to Kona Hawaii connecting both ways in Honolulu. The LAS-HON leg is on an Airbus with 2+4+2 seating in economy so my wife and I can sit together. Hawaiian doesn't jam the seats in economy together as much as some airlines. And for an extra $35 per passenger each way you can get a bulkhead or exit row seat with tons of legroom but to get this you have to do online check-in pretty darn close to 24 hours before your flight. You can actually call the airline and talk to a customer representative without waiting more than a few minutes. If you fly in the evening you get a free tasty although small real hot meal with veggies and meat salad and dessert. (The breakfast service is also free but not as nice as the dinner.) Also when I asked about wine the steward mentioned the half bottle (375 ml) of red as having pleased other passengers so my wife and I bought it for $16 and it was a nice pinot noir.,10hawaiian-airlines,23/11/12,Arrived at Kona airport with Hawaiian taking us to connect on Oahu with united to California. Had first class tickets upgraded with United points. They tried to charge us for all our bags even though our ticket clearly stated our luggage was free. We asked for a supervisor who still refused to do anything. Finally agree but had delayed us so long we missed our flight. To add insult to injury they stuck us in economy on the next flight. Interesting to see they do not honor United premier or upgrades. Pretty unhappy with desk service!,hawaiian-airlines,25/10/12,LAX-HNL HNL-SFO in A330s. The planes were new and clean. Soft drinks and tea/coffee are free. You also get a free meal (poor to fair quality) with a free wine to accompany it. They nickel and dime you for everything else (baggage IFE (films etc.) preferred seating). Cabin crew was efficient but not overly friendly on the outbound flight and on the return flight one member was downright surly. He didn't even look at us when handing us drinks and ignored us when we asked questions. Also took inter-island flights HNL-ITO return in B717s. Good for short flights and you get a free juice or coffee. In summary Hawaiian are good for inter-island but avoid them for long-haul flights.,5hawaiian-airlines,25/10/12,HNL-SFO in A330. The planes were new and clean. Soft drinks and tea/coffee are free. You also get a free meal (poor to fair quality) with a free wine to accompany it. They nickel and dime you for everything else (baggage IFE (films etc.) preferred seating). Cabin crew was efficient but not overly friendly the outbound flight and on the return flight one member was downright surly. He didn't even look at us when handing us drinks and ignored us when we asked questions. So much for the aloha. Other airlines are on these routes so save yourself the extra few dollars as the only extra thing you get is essentially a mediocre meal. Also took inter-island flights HNL-ITO return in B717s. Good for short flights and you get a juice or coffee. In summary Hawaiian are good for inter-island but avoid them for long-haul flights.,5hawaiian-airlines,11/10/12,"I hate overnight flights so I booked Business class for the Sydney Hawaii leg in the hope that the extra $1000 would provide a decent night's sleep. Wrong! While the seats do have a footrest and recline more than in economy there was little similarity between Hawaiian and other carriers business class seats Even the pillows were the small and inadequate and the amenities provided were very basic - no cute bag to keep as a souvenir. The cabin crew were excellent and the food served much better than economy but again there is no comparison between it and say the food served in Qantas premium economy. Our flight back to Sydney was back in economy and I was very happy with the experience though the ""Hawaiian high tea"" served towards the end of the flight was just a roll and a biscuit. Flights on all the sectors I flew were on time and had very professional and helpful cabin crew.",6hawaiian-airlines,24/09/12,Flew Honolulu to Sydney in Economy. Got exit row seats row 33 with bulkhead in front. Plenty of leg room and no one in front putting their seat back. The only problem was that other people feel it is a through traffic area and use it to cross from one side of the plane to the other. I paid the $75 to have that space for me. I ended up no moving my legs and annoyed some people by doing so. The other thing is the flight attendant was going to move another passenger into the empty seat between myself and a travel friend as the other person was unhappy with her normal economy seat. I complained and reminded her that we had paid $75 for these seats and why should she get a free seat. There were empty rows of seats at the back of the plane that she could have moved her to. I got my way and she was not moved to the exit row seats. Food was good digeplayer was poor. Staff overall were ok. Did not show to much of an effect to make the trip enjoyable. But would fly with them again.,7hawaiian-airlines,13/09/12,Seattle to Honolulu return in economy. Enhanced meal service with new breakfast box containing bread with cream cheese guava jelly dried fruit and a macadamia nut cookie. Return dinner teriyaki chicken with salad and cake for dessert. All this food plus a free mai tai on the way out and wine with dinner on the return on a domestic USA flight and free to boot? Unheard of nowadays but thank you Hawaiian for still being the only US carrier to offer free food on flights. Cabin crew generally friendly and sharing the aloha spirit. Be nice to the crew and they will be nice back to you. Cant wait for them to bring the A330 to Seattle!,9hawaiian-airlines,11/09/12,Although I am Pualani Platinum and am generally looked after on Hawaiian I have two upgrade certificates which are virtually useless as my preferred flights are booked out and being able to secure any upgrade from within the allowed window of 7 days to 4 hours of the flight is impossible. I have travelled Business on several occasions between Sydney and Honolulu during 2011-12 and although there has been an introduction of new aircraft of late previous flights have been on old planes with tray tables faulty on two occasions. Seats are also not very comfortable in Business although are better than Economy where space between is very tight especially with tray table down and the seat in front reclined. On 6 September 2012 I did Honolulu-JFK on HA50 at least ending up in a pre-booked window seat in row 13. Overall it was very ordinary if adequate without anything terribly exciting. Arrival at JFK was good in what potentially is a nightmare airport.,5hawaiian-airlines,20/08/12,Maui-Oakland/SF-Honolulu First Class. As always an extremely good experience due to the friendly staff good food and comfortable seating. Puts the legacy carriers to shame. Maui-Oakland on an older 767 and SF- Honolulu on the new A330. Both aircraft's have their pluses and minuses. Seats on the 767 are actually more comfortable when upright while the entertainment on the 330 is far superior in choices. Meal service is the same and was excellent on both flighst. Staff friendly and welcoming in short everything a cabin crew should be but rarely is these days especially to and from Hawaii.,10hawaiian-airlines,07/08/12,LAX-HNL-SYD-HNL-JFK. A330-200 on every route. Staff and front desk very helpful. FA's very nice. On flights to mainland you have to pay for IFE. On LAX-HNL leg they served a turkey sandwich and a brownie. Chose to upgrade to the cheeseburger for $12.99. Not a lot of leg room onboard but the seat wasn't too bad. Boarding was slick and organized. On flight to Sydney you were served a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing-not really enough for a 10 hour flight. You also had to pay for IFE on New York flight which is a long route with no IFE. I would definitely fly Hawaiian if I was going from mainland US to Hawaii and definitely a better experience then when I flew United to Hawaii.,9hawaiian-airlines,06/08/12,It feels like Hawaiian Airlines is becoming more like Delta and United with their very late flights. I've had my fair share of flights amongst the mentioned airlines. I never thought I'd even be comparing the three airlines. Third time in a row my flight is leaving more than an hour late. This last time Hawaiian boarded us then told us to get off because they needed to refuel. We were told we'd leave in two hours. Five hours later they board us again then tell us they still need to refuel. I forgot to mention they were kind enough to reimburse us with poor head sets.,5hawaiian-airlines,22/07/12,HNL-FUK-HNL on 767. Excellent fare to/from Seoul when connecting in Fukuoka - almost half-price of non- stop. Average experience does not come close to Asiana. No in-seat entertainment no choice of meals and what was served was mediocre cabin attendants disappear for a long time very little communication from pilots. Of four possible aisle seats three have a box underneath that limits foot comfort-choose G to avoid box. In 3-seat middle section I was put with couple and their baby luckily well-behaved but 4 people in 3 seats not acceptable. On-time and smooth connection in Fukuoka to avoid customs. Overall acceptable but cabin service on 9-hour flight not up to standards of airlines based in Asia.,5hawaiian-airlines,22/07/12,We flew from Sydney to Las Vegas via Hawaii and return. We decided to treat ourselves to First class both ways which ended up a little disappointing to say the least. The seats did not recline very far (about the same recline as Qantas economy) and the food going over was just plonked in front of us in one hit. At least the staff coming back had a better idea of serving food. I have food allergies (which I notified the airlines of when we booked) and they said they'll see what they can do - all I can say was I was hungry when I arrived except for the food I took with me! Also the inflight entertainment was the same on all four legs so I was wishing I had brought a good book with me. The positives were the staff were friendly drink service was great and they boarded us quickly.,3hawaiian-airlines,19/07/12,We flew on 2 July 2012 9.20pm flight from Sydney to Honolulu on A330. Plane was half hour late arriving into Sydney which made about 1 hour late departing. Staff food seats were great. We then flew from Honolulu to Big Island on 11 July and returned to Hon on 14 July and then departed Honolulu on 15 July back to Sydney. Good service and friendly staff. 15 July flight home at 12.45pm was again late yet was not Hawaiian's fault. Overall would fly with them again no problem. Food was lovely and plenty of it. Entertainment units were good and purchase of movies if required was easy.,10hawaiian-airlines,15/07/12,Flew on their new direct flight from Honolulu to New York (JFK) to celebrate the 4th of July. Very impressed with the speed of their boarding flight attendants were friendly and enough storage space. The seats of this Airbus were slightly wider than normal HAL planes so didn't feel like a packed sardine the seat itself slides forward as it reclines and there were folds on the headrest so you wouldn't end up on your neighbor's shoulder; it was quite comfortable to sit for the 10 hour haul. Free soda snack and meals (2) snacks for purchase alcoholic drinks for purchase premium meals for purchase. Surprised that you actually get 2 basic meals for free. Passed out free headsets and there were some video and audio for free but had to pay for others. Everyone has their own video monitor so very cool. USB input available. I kept falling asleep during the meal and drink service and they were very accommodating to bring it for me when I woke up. No regrets and will be returning in 6 months!,10hawaiian-airlines,04/07/12,Check in at Kansai A/P (Japan) is dysfunctional. I had bought round trip tickets state side for travel from SFO to Kansai due to personal circumstances I ended up buying the trip in 2 segments (for the same day). The first from SFO to Honolulu with a connecting Hawaiian flight to Kansai with similar routing on the return. I was assured I would be able to route my baggage through from SFO to Kansai and visa versa (i.e. without having to pickup and recheck in Honolulu). The agents at SFO were able to do this but the Japanese agent at Kansai insisted that Hawaiian required all baggage picked up at Honolulu with passenger responsibility to recheck bags for continuation flight to SFO. Of course this created undue/unnecessary passenger burden! Bottom line Hawaiian needs to improve training of the Japanese agents they hire for check in at Kansai. I will never take Hawaiian for travel outside the states again!,3hawaiian-airlines,03/07/12,ITO-OGG-ITO Weekend inter-island flight. It was an uneventful flight. Service from check-in to inflight was amazing. Its the only way to fly.,9hawaiian-airlines,28/06/12,"Flew from Honolulu to Maui on Hawaiian Airlines because of my executive platinum status on AA. With my status we thought that it would give us preferred boarding and no checked bag fees - wrong! I stepped into the ""Premier"" line to see if we could get on an earlier flight as we were at the airport ahead of schedule. The woman behind the counter rudely told me to get into the other line (no one behind me BTW) because my status on AA ""didn't matter"" to Hawaiian Airlines even though they were a codeshare partner. I stepped in the other line only to get right back to the same person five minutes later. I asked if we could standby for the earlier flight and she proceeded to charge us $50 per person. For a thirty minute flight with open seats? Decided against that and was rudely reminded that we would still have to pay baggage check fees because they didn't care about our status with AA. Her tone was so rude that I asked to speak to a supervisor who came out and proceeded to complain about AA. I will avoid Hawaiian Airlines at all costs and fly one of the other commuter airlines with better service and lower costs.",2hawaiian-airlines,24/06/12,JFK-HNL roundtrip. The food on both flights were very good. There were drinks given throughout the flight and you were able to get a drink anytime throughout the flight. The FA's were nice and interacting with the passengers and were polite and were always cleaning the plane. The bathrooms were clean and FA's cleaned them frequently throughout the flight which is something you do not normally see. On the A330 there was plenty of legroom in the economy class. However the one drawback was when I was trying to confirm a seat on the plane the person on the phone was unhelpful and was unable to help my problem. On the flight you also had to pay for the in flight entertainment and they had a big selection of movies to choose from.,8hawaiian-airlines,13/06/12,We were married in Maui. Our outbound was very good. On our return flight to Vegas we had a medical stop in Oakland. When we landed some passengers got new flights and hotels to stay in two groups were connecting on Southwest however the customer service desk said they don't work with Southwest so they had to find their own accommodation. In the meantime I got a new flight on my own and I gave a staff member the numbers to our new flights to add our luggage to. He promised it would be there then he left without telling us anything. We slept in the airport until the next morning where we flew out. Our luggage was not on the flight with us.,3hawaiian-airlines,29/05/12,LAX-HNL on the new A330-200 economy class. Boarding at LAX was chaotic and crowded although we were spared the worst of it because we got priority boarding with 2 babies. The flight left on time and arrived about 25 minutes early. There was no wait on the tarmac at HNL for a free gate. Inflight service was much better than average for U.S. carriers food was decent IFE was better than the competition and the cabin crew smiled more and was more attentive than average for U.S carriers.,9hawaiian-airlines,16/05/12,Honolulu to Maui. Tried to leave on an earlier flight that was not even half full. Arrived at the airport early for that flight only to find out they wanted to charge me extra to change times. Why? Especially on a commuter flight with no meals being served. Very disappointed at the service.,2hawaiian-airlines,14/05/12,Recently flew HNL-SYD on the 330 aircraft brand new seat and legroom were adequate. Crew were thumbs up food and presentation were great. Kept us well fed/hydrated I was left impressed with the service provided by HA and will definitely fly them over Qantas who operates an older 767 with service no match to Hawaiian.,9hawaiian-airlines,10/05/12,Hawaiian is my preferred inter-island carrier. This was my first time using them on their Transpacific flight. I flew from Hilo to Las Vegas and was quite impressed. Flight crews on both flights were very warm and welcoming. Any requests were honored with a smile. Flights were smooth both ways. Check-in was a breeze in Hilo and Las Vegas. For meals I was offered a complimentary pasta dish with a piece of cake and a Turkey sandwich on the return. Flight attendants were visible throughout the flight and constant runs of drinks. Very Impressed.,9hawaiian-airlines,25/04/12,Sydney to Honolulu return over the Easter period. Both flights were full and both aircraft's older refurbished 767's. No AVOD but portable digi players were available for rent at US$15 credit card payment only. A330's will commence on this route soon. Both flights left and arrived on time although check-in at Sydney took 50 minutes because they're weren't enough check-in attendants. Meals on both flights were satisfactory and service was fine although flight attendants were hardly seen between the meal services. Would be happy to fly with them again.,8hawaiian-airlines,25/04/12,We flew to Honolulu from Sydney in Business Class and returned in Coach. We have a 8 month old son and my wife is vegetarian. On the Business Class leg there was no bassinet available even though promised and we could not be confirmed that any of the food would be vegetarian. As a result our son had to sleep on our laps for an 11 hour flight. Service was very friendly and they assisted us greatly to make it comfortable with pillows but we were trapped in seats for the entire flight. On the return leg seat allocations were not confirmed bassinet not available again and instead of being the front row of the main cabin we were stuck in the middle rows and had to ask passengers in front not to recline so as not to hit our sleeping son. The food was minimal and only 1 meal was vegetarian. Service and food were good but very minimal. There are higher quality ways to get to Hawaii from Australia.,6hawaiian-airlines,23/04/12,My preferred airline from Sydney to the USA via Honolulu. Generally on time ground staff are great and cabin crew always smiling. Frequent flyer membership has great offers for gold and platinum members. On all my trips baggage arrives quickly and food in both Economy and Business is good.,7hawaiian-airlines,21/04/12,SYD to Honolulu return. Plane was an older 767 but had been refreshed inside and looks more like a 777. Check-in in Sydney was hassle free. Flight over was fine but seats were a bit uncomfortable. Meals were ok but service was average. Didn't really see attendants that much. No inseat entertainment. you can rent portable DVD style players though. Cabin crew ran out of customs forms so you had to wait to land before these could be filled out which caused a delay at customs. On the way return again check in was hassle free and better than in SYD. All the portable DVD players were gone by the time they got to me. Flight attendants were very nice but rarely seen. All the toilets in the rear of the plan were not working about 6 hours into the flight so a bit of a wait for the other toilets. All in all it was ok.,5hawaiian-airlines,01/04/12,Sydney to Honolulu with an 8 month old. Never again. No bassinet available on both legs despite reservation. Crew very unhelpful and not interested in assisting us with details of baby change toilet or heating bottles etc. Food was terrible and service not at all satisfactory. I will not fly this airline again. Have flown extensively with my child since he was born both internationally and domestically and Hawaiian certainly takes the cake for being our worst experience.,2hawaiian-airlines,26/03/12,We used Hawaiian because they had a direct flight. After we booked it was changed to a flight with a layover. Once onboard the flight crew made my wife (then the bride) to roll her wedding dress up and wedge it between luggage in the overhead bin. Flight attendants we very short tempered with us seemed stressed and overall very unpleasant. Our video player stopped working when we got a replacement the audio and video did not match up. The seat tray was covered with dried food when I asked for a cloth to clean it the flight attendant sighed and turned around without answering.,1hawaiian-airlines,21/03/12,Flying from Vancouver and scheduled to catch the last flight of the evening across to Kona. There was just over an hour between our arrival and departure for Kona. Held in a holding pattern over HON. Once we landed we sprinted for Hawaiian Airlines check-in arriving 30 mins before the flight only to be told it was too late to check-in-. Check-in was rude and unhelpful just basically repeating over and over that we had missed the luggage check-in. We ended up spending a long acutely uncomfortable night sitting at HON airport.,hawaiian-airlines,21/03/12,We chose them because of the generous luggage allowances. We were late taking off due to a passenger needing to be removed the delay was handled well with minimum disturbance and the captain kept us all informed. Mid flight there was a medical emergency and that was also handled well. We were given preferred seating as my husband is very tall and we could not fault our seats and the added leg room was wonderful. The flight crew were friendly and attentive. The meal was okay. I wish they had in-seat entertainment. Although not the best flight ever certainly not the worst.,7hawaiian-airlines,19/03/12,Flew 767-300 Sydney to Hawaii first class. Very uncomfortable broken seats that didn't even recline properly. Terrible food average service. No dinner served and no snacks over an 11 hour flight. Worst airport lounges. Whole experience was dreadfully. Never again!,1hawaiian-airlines,05/03/12,Just checked in for our first class seat from Maui to Seattle. First class line longer wait than others. Staff very rude went and helped coach line while we were checking in. Another person came back to help us and had to do checking again with her. They didn't tell us our flight was delayed when we checked in. This was a special trip for us and we never travel first class. I can't believe the rude service for such a higher fare that we paid for.,hawaiian-airlines,28/02/12,Service was of high standard. Australia to Honolulu. Flight attendants very polite and courteous. My husband and I were most impressed. Food was alright and staff were quick and efficient. People with children were well looked after.,8hawaiian-airlines,06/02/12,SFO-HNL. Emergency return to SFO 16 hours total delay due A330 computer glitch. Flight crew very good but once on ground things began well and then fell apart. After lunch vouchers and evening hotel rooms for a few they had us all return at 10 pm for a 1 am flight on a different A330. We got to HNL at 4.46 am instead of noon the day before and got $300 vouchers good only on new reservations on Hawaiian for one year.,3hawaiian-airlines,30/01/12,LAS-HNL-LIH. This was a repeat of last years trip and some things have improved others have not. Ground handling at LAS is much better: the staff were there early enough to check-in bags in good time. The A330s are nice enough planes still looking fresh and clean. Seat back screens do not offer a great deal without payment but is better than nothing. The food offered is basic and not very much. Flight was on time. HNL-LIH was again on time for the very short hop. The planes used on inter-Island sectors are not impressive but they do the job. Return was straightforward. Flights on time no problems not the most comfortable but not too bad.,7hawaiian-airlines,24/01/12,Just came back from a one week vacation to Honolulu from LA. My trip from LA to HNL was pleasant. No major complaints only minor ones. We left 15 mins late but arrived on time to HNL. My dinner was a sandwich and the bread was mushy. Although the plane is equipped with personal touch screens on every seat there are very few complimentary options to enjoy. You have to pay for movies TV shows music selection and games. On our return from HNL to LA our flight left on time and arrived 15 mins early. Personnel were a lot less enjoyable lnot rude but did not make you feel welcome. There were two different meal options however by my turn they only had sandwiches left. Overall they got the job done and did not experience any major hiccup but at the end of the day we did pay a premium and so I expected more.,7hawaiian-airlines,17/01/12,HNL-LIH. I've flown this route a few times and generally find Hawaiian to be a bit over-rated and frequently delayed. This time there were no issues. Flight departed on time. Boarding was quick and efficient. B717 in great shape. Smooth ride. Nice crew. Value for money.,9hawaiian-airlines,01/01/12,Las Vegas from Sydney via Honolulu return. Food was terrible. They had my husband and I sitting separately - despite the fact this happened last time and I went overboard asking for it not to happen again - 4 flights sitting separately. The seats were awfully uncomfortable. General lack of 'couldn't care' by staff. Even when I said I didn't feel well and asked for water they never came back.,3hawaiian-airlines,18/12/11,LAX-HNL on Airbus A330. Flight was delayed 35 minutes. At first it was announced that the flight was delayed due to TSA requirements. Then it was announced the delay was due to scheduling problems. Boarding commenced shortly after the missing flight attendant arrived. The economy cabin was very cramped. The seat was simply uncomfortable even for a 5 hour flight. The seat was hard and narrow with poor leg room. The IFE system had a decent variety but required a fee (so make sure you have your credit card on hand) though on a full service airline this should be complimentary. Refreshments were served. Breakfast was served shortly after but consisted of a disgusting breakfast burrito and sugary bun with no other options. No complimentary refreshments were available for the remaining 3.5 hours of the flight. The flight attendants were well mannered but unprofessional. The flight concluded with the managing flight attendant listing all of the routes that Hawaiian Airlines services and will service in the future and instructing all passengers to recommend Hawaiian Airlines to all of our family and friends.,3hawaiian-airlines,11/12/11,Horrible flight from Manila through Hawaii to mainland US. Late leaving Manila and late arrival in Hawaii. 8 passengers missed their connecting flights to US. Extremely poor customer service provided by HA. HA customer service email was just a cover up with excuses for the poor customer service!,hawaiian-airlines,29/10/11,Seattle to Hawaii delayed 8 hours. We were given vouchers for two meals and nice accommodation. However upon return our vacation ended poorly. We got a phone call to say the flight would be delayed 6 hours then 8 then 10. Staff struggled to cope with the situation and passengers were treated with little courtesy given the situation. In one notable incident we were asked to line up for an 'ag inspection' only to be told that 'ag inspectors' were not available yet for it. $12 vouchers to cover this 10 hour period were entirely inadequate. Additional costs exceeded this. We were given $200 vouchers for future use on HA for both delays but I seriously doubt we would consider HA for future travel.,hawaiian-airlines,05/10/11,Wife and I flew San Jose to Maui via Honolulu. Same route on our return. I found the staff to be pleasant and accommodating. The food offered was ok but we did not expect much more. My complaint was with the airplane seat. I am 6â€™4â€ù and 205lbs. The seats were so uncomfortable with no leg room. Despite getting up and walking around a bit it was torturous having to return to my seat. On our next trip I may pony up for a First Class seat â€“ the continued pain is just not worth it.,3hawaiian-airlines,04/10/11,"We fly Hawaiian because it is the only non-stop from HNL to San Diego. Flight from HNL to SD on 767 had incredibly little legroom I'm only 5'5"" and couldn't get my legs under the seat in front due to some metal box affixed to floor. FA's were okay.",3hawaiian-airlines,25/09/11,Honolulu to San Francisco. Outbound food which you have to buy onboard was expensive and limited. The return flight was delayed by at least 10 hours and we decided to book ourselves onto another airline. Staff did not know which reception point would have our bags; we then had to find our way out of the building to another terminal and check-in again paying a further $50 for our two suitcases. The check-in arrangements at Honolulu are poor - too few people handling the check-in for Economy Class.,1hawaiian-airlines,27/08/11,Sydney to Honolulu return. I have really only one complaint because Australia and Perth in particular is so far away the time spent sitting in one spot for over 12-15 hrs is hard enough without the seating and general facilities being less than user friendly. Return flight from Honolulu to Sydney was very cramped (leg room) and there was a lot less overhead baggage space than the flight to Honolulu. This made the experience more uncomfortable than it could have been.,3hawaiian-airlines,17/08/11,Honolulu to Hilo on a Boeing 717. The flight was very average. Check-in was a mess. Had to wait in line for a machine and when you checked in your bags you needed to wait for someone who works for Hawaiian to come. The service was average they come around with juice during flight. You barely even new there were FA's. Overall I didn't expect much and I didn't get much.,5hawaiian-airlines,17/08/11,From check-in to arrival nothing went right from HNL to LAX. Our carry-ons were acceptable on the way from LAX-HNL and not on the return. We were warned I would be removed from the flight if I refused to check-in baggage. The flight from HNL-LAX departed 30 mins later than scheduled. The flight attendant threw my sandwich in my lap. The night crew from HNL to LAX were not friendly with no smile from a single crew member. The plane was very old (767). My husbands seat had a metal piece sticking out between the backrest and the seat. Bring your own headset or portable DVD if you want technology. Our flight from LAX to HNL was delayed and we sat on the plane for more than 1.5 hrs. I would not recommend Hawaiian airlines you get what you pay for.,1hawaiian-airlines,14/08/11,Sydney-Honolulu return. Upon check-in at Sydney advised that we were split up. Food was only one option. Planes old with no in seat entertainment unless you pay $15USD for a portable unit.,1hawaiian-airlines,13/08/11,Honolulu-Seattle return on B767. Baggage handling and boarding staff were lovely. I was in Economy class and the seats were comfortable I managed to sleep. Flight attendants were friendly and available in the aisles food choices were delicious safety instructions were polite and clear. Lavatories were clean inflight entertainment had plenty of choice.,10hawaiian-airlines,25/07/11,Sydney-Honolulu-Sydney. Pleased with the services both in the air and on the ground. The check-in staff at Sydney airport were pleasant and courteous. The meal after take-off from Sydney was ok. The outbound flight was an overnight one and an eye-shade was offered which was nice. The check-in staff were kind and helpful when checking-in for return flight at Honolulu airport. The home-bound inflight service was excellent cockpit crew for both flights were first-class. The cabin crew are sincere laid-back and easily approachable.,10hawaiian-airlines,18/07/11,HNL-LAS on an A330. New aircraft in excellent condition. Paid to upgrade to a Premium seat in bulkhead row 14 which had at least 48 inches of legroom. Great IVOD offerings but limited free selections. Meal was adequate and accompanied by great cabin service throughout the flight. I have avoided Hawaiian in the past while the numerous fees have only got worse with time this was all-in-all an unexpectedly good flight.,6hawaiian-airlines,18/07/11,First class from HNL-SMF. We have flown First Class several times before on this route but this flight was exceptional. The flight attendants went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of and checked on us regularly to make sure we had whatever we needed. Hawaiian has a real asset with this crew. On the flip side I do have complaints not related to the staff of Hawaiian. I am a Premier Club member and upon rejoining this year I found out that the benefits have changed. Members and a companion were allowed two pieces of checked luggage gratis. That has now changed to only the member getting that. We used to be able to ask for an exit row and that has also changed and now you pay $25. It's difficult justifying paying $249 a year for a rest in a room at the airport and some packaged snacks.,10hawaiian-airlines,12/07/11,"Manila-Seattle via Honolulu and return with an additional stopover in Maui. Flights were labelled as Business Class (MNL-HNL) and First Class (HNL-SEA) though in fact there is no difference in cabin or service. All flights were on Hawaiian's elderly 767's. Do not be fooled by the winglets (which HA added to save fuel) these are old planes with interiors to match. Also do not for a moment think you will be getting anything like a Business or First Class product on a first tier airline this would be a mediocre Premium Economy product at best. The seat I would guesstimate the pitch to be around 38-40"" with limited recline and in a 2-2-2 layout with only 3 rows. I am 6ft 5"" and sat in 1B for all sectors this bulkhead seat has the advantage that you don't have someone reclining their head into your lap but the leg space is woefully inadequate. I had to sit at an angle with my feet into the forward galley to get at all comfortable. The AV comprised personal players that were handed out with a limited range of films and TV shows pre-loaded. Unfortunately this was the same content for all 4 long haul flights and by the end of the first flight I had already watched all that interested me. It was also awkward to use these during the meal service as there was basically nowhere to put them. Food was adequate although dry and uninspiring. The ""champagne"" served on take off was in fact a fairly unpleasant Prosecco and the single white wine choice with the meal was probably a hazard to the aircraft paintwork if you spilled any. As with all airplane travel the quality of the experience is relative to the price you have paid. Clearly Hawaiian are used to people upgrading into this cabin either as a frequent flyer freebie or as a $1-200 add on to the regular ticket price in which case possibly its worth it but probably not.",4hawaiian-airlines,25/06/11,"LAX-HNL A330 a nice new plane but very disappointing experience. Carry-on baggage size limit not enforced making those of us who paid the $25 feel like fools. Boarding time on boarding pass 45 mins ahead but boarding does not begin until 30 mins before (happened on another HA flight so assume that Hawaiian thinks passengers too stupid to get there on time) causing uncomfortable wait in undersized departure lounge. The inflight ""meal"" they boast about is a tasteless ham and cheese sandwich with a brownie served in a cardboard box- a ""snack"" at best. Flight attendants not friendly lacking any Aloha spirit. Had hoped that Hawaiian would be better.",3hawaiian-airlines,23/06/11,"HNL-SYD. Travelling with 4 young children and wife. Departure delayed by 2 hrs. Nice new 767 but no personal AVOD. Could not get infant seat belt for 1 yr old despite repeated request. My wife was quite worried as this has always been available when needed. Staff seemed uninterested almost unhelpful and sometimes rude. Kept to themselves gossiping in the back of the plane. Food was ok. Toilets started to break down half way through the 10 hr flight. 3 hrs out of SYD no toilets were working! A cabin announcement was made advising that passengers should refrain from using toilets especially depositing ""solids"". Captain advised on landing that he considered landing in Fiji but by the time pax would be deplaned it would have been about the same time to reach a working toilet. Sometimes things go wrong which is understandable but cabin crew were very poor. A memorable experience!",3hawaiian-airlines,17/06/11,"I am not a fussy person but I really thought this was the worst service I have ever had on an airline. Both ground staff and cabin crew were rude to me on a number of occasions about the fact that I am diabetic. I was given a hard time about my need to carry ""sharps"" with me even though I offered to hand them over to the cabin crew. The food wasn't very good and there were only 2 choices of meals. One was totally unsuitable for a diabetic so I asked if I could have the alternative choice reserved for me. They refused and I got stuck with the unsuitable food (because they ran out of the other choice) on each leg of my journey. My requests re the food and carrying my diabetic supplies were quite reasonable and I made them in a very polite manner and yet I was treated like a real trouble-maker. This was not what I expected from Hawaiians who I know to be very hospitable people. A huge disappointment and I would not fly willingly with them again.",2hawaiian-airlines,15/06/11,Horrible experience. SEA-OGG and back and was severely harassed for trying to use my common Graco infant car seat to keep my baby safe in flight (the airline approval sticker was partially ripped off however you could clearly see it was airline approved). Once they finally said I could use it I was not allowed to use the car seat correctly (rear-facing) as they said it would not allow the person in front of it to recline their seat. Never mind that there were very many empty seats on this flight they could have moved this person to including the empty seat next to him if it had bothered him. Then was harassed because they assumed I had not purchased a seat for my infant when in fact I had and was required to show my tickets to them. Again despite having at least 8 empty seats within four rows of the seat I was in - it was a very empty flight. I fly often and have never experienced such horrible customer service.,hawaiian-airlines,08/06/11,SYD-HNL-SYD Economy. An older B767 but for a 3 star airline I thought service was pretty good. They looked after the kids with kids meals and were always offering free drinks and mid flight snacks. We also flew to Maui return from HNL and the service was the best I have experienced.,8hawaiian-airlines,08/06/11,Excellent service on LAX-HNL flight on new A330. The seat is a mistake but everything else top rate. The food service IFE. I hope they continue with their current meal service and don't adopt the mistake they've made on their international runs by changing it!,9hawaiian-airlines,07/06/11,"Seats cramped - even for 5'6"" and 140 lbs and the equipment is ancient. Mine had bilingual German/English everywhere. They charge for everything almost. Want to use a headset -you pay. Want to use your own headset to watch the movie - you pay. Don't want the mystery meat sandwich - you pay ($12 for a hamburger that would be like a buck at Mac's). You want overhead room - get on board first and expect no help from the cabin attendants standing around talking about their personal lives with one another. You want to rent a DVD player. Maybe you can maybe you cannot. They had the players but forgot to bring batteries on board. Hawaiian is like a poor man's Southwest. Unless the fare you get is way below the competition I cannot see why you would fly with them.",2hawaiian-airlines,05/06/11,We were supposed to leave at 3PM but due to aircraft problems we ended up taking off at 2am the next day to begin our trip home to San Diego. The flight attendants were wonderful and very supportive. Hawaiian airlines gave us a free shuttle to a local mall while we were at the airport. We got free movie tickets and a $200 voucher and gave us good snacks etc. We also got a discount on our next purchase.,8hawaiian-airlines,01/06/11,LAX-HNL-LAX. Check-in in LAX was good. New A330 service in F class to HNL was good. Seats are not flat. Return to LAX with aged B767. Check-in staff in HNL rude and charged me $50 extra for an overweight bag by 3lbs even I'm a 1st class pax. My overweight bag was lost upon arrival in LAX which was returned to me almost a week later. The delivery man was lost so I met him 20 miles from my residence. If HA wants to be a world class airline they should take some lessons leading airlines in Asia and Middle East.,6hawaiian-airlines,29/05/11,Portland to Lihue return with change of planes in Honolulu both ways. No real problems until we arrived home to find our camera was stolen out of our checked baggage.,2hawaiian-airlines,21/05/11,Phoenix to Oahu on Hawaiian and on return flight had a 4 hour delay due to a mechanical problem on plane. The food was awful and even the food they charged for looked awful. The positive was that staff were friendly.,5hawaiian-airlines,19/05/11,Honolulu-Manila Business Class. Very disappointed to note that Hawaiian Airlines new upgraded inflight service is a real downgrade. They've ditched the tapas style menu for a slow food service. In addition they are no longer catered by Chef Gannon and for the first time in years I was served bad food on Hawaiian Airlines. The flight attendants were wonderful but clearly embarrassed by the downgrade. In addition the new printed menus are tacky. Also time to retire the 767. Just not up to standard for a 10 hour plus flight!,6hawaiian-airlines,17/05/11,HNL-LAS-HNL on new A330. Hawaiian is probably the best of the US carriers. Both flights full but service was good with frequent water runs - although the complimentary food was awful served in a cardboard box!,7hawaiian-airlines,14/05/11,LAX-HNL-SYD-HNL-LAX.Flew from the US to Australia on Hawaiian in first/business on a discounted fare. Seat comfort is significantly better than US legacy carriers domestic first class but well short of modern international business class standards but comfortable enough for the long flights - an old style business class product. Service and food exceptional. The cabin staff go the extra mile in attentiveness up front and the tapas style menus were creative and tasty. IFE is good not great. Lounges in LAX and HNL are dreadful but HA business class passengers can access the Air New Zealand lounge in SYD which is exceptional.,8hawaiian-airlines,08/05/11,Honolulu to Sydney. Worst service of any airline I have flown. I am a vegetarian did not have an option for me except a few bags of chips. When asked for a can of coke they said they were nearly out and could only give us a cup. Cabin staff unhelpful and not friendly.,2hawaiian-airlines,27/04/11,SYD-HNL-SEA and back via HNL to SYD. Whilst I agree with some of the comments re the indifference of cabin staff (I had to ask for water after 2 hours on the ground owing to a mechanical problem) I will continue to fly Hawaiian because baggage allowance is the best in the air and I have always found check-in staff helpful. Two seats outside the aisles are the best way for a couple to fly no need to constantly wake a stranger to use the facilities or stretch my legs food is to my taste good safety record.,9hawaiian-airlines,25/04/11,SYD-HNL flight was great and seating comfortable. HNL to SYD was full and extremely uncomfortable. I was seated next to a young fat boy I paid for my seat and feel entitled to the whole seat I paid for. When an airlines allocates seat they should be aware of the size of the person. I'm petite and fit comfortably in a seat but when an oversized person is put beside be that takes 1/4 of my seat. When I complained the hostess said 'sorry we are fully booked'.,3hawaiian-airlines,14/04/11,HNL-SYD on B767-300ER. I bought a discount Economy ticket but was able to upgrade at the gate to Business Class for $400. It was well worth it. HA Business Class seat is an old style business class seat not a reclining flat bed. Nevertheless with the spacious pitch and large foot rest it was comfortable for dozing. IFE is a portable media player which was fine since no one was seated next to me. It wasn't stable there. The movie selection was not first run but it was adequate for a ten hour flight. There was no power outlet in the seat for my laptop. The food and service were excellent. The meal was a selection of three dishes from an assortment and were delicious. The wine selection was ok but the mixed drinks were fun as you would expect in Hawaii. Most importantly the service was exceptional friendly and helpful,9hawaiian-airlines,12/04/11,"Since Hawaiian Airlines began charging a fee for checked bags the volume of carry-on luggage has become quite unreasonable. Last month ny husband and I traveled first class from Portland to Honolulu and back. As first class passengers and because my husband uses a wheelchair we boarded first. When the coach passengers began to board my husband and I were literally smacked in the head and shoulders with carry-on luggage - large tote bags overloaded backpacks and even a child safety seat. We had to lean into the space between the seats in order to avoid injury. When I got home I contacted Hawaiian Airlines ""customer advocacy"" program because I wanted to report my experience. A very bored representative took my report and told me someone would get back to me. Three weeks later I had not heard a word from the company. I called again. This time a super-rude rep with minimal language skills told me they had no record of my prior call. When I began again to explain about being smacked in the head and shoulders by carry-on luggage she said 'Well I sorry you have inconvenience"". Now that Alaska Airlines is flying non-stop from Portland to Honolulu I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.",6hawaiian-airlines,03/04/11,Honolulu to Lihue return. Going out the plane was full service was efficient and friendly. Coming back I flew standby but was told in advance that there many seats on the plane and that I would have no problem getting on. When I arrived the plane was full and the ground agent did not give me a boarding pass until the plane was fully boarded. She had me running to get on the plane even though she was fully aware of the vacant seat and she could have given it to me minutes earlier. When I boarded the plane the flight attendant approached me and told me they were all waiting for me and that I needed to hurry up!,5hawaiian-airlines,15/03/11,LAX-HNL. The aircraft was downgraded from a new A330 to a well worn 767. Most of the FAs were helpful and did their best in the cramped and crowded aisles. A problem with the galley ovens meant there would be no hot meals served. Those of us seated up front were served cold and tasteless appetizers and nothing more. This was truly not Hawaiian Airlines at its best and not worth the $349 upgrade paid prior to boarding.,2hawaiian-airlines,14/03/11,SFO-HNL-SFO in first class. I have to say their service should be a standard for all US based airlines. Outstanding customer service and food was amazing.,10hawaiian-airlines,27/02/11,"SYD-HNL-SYD with connecting flights to the Big Island. Check-in at Sydney was efficient and in the air service was good. Food wasn't but my expectations were not high given the price of the ticket. Connecting flight to Kona and return went without a hitch but the return leg to Sydney was a nightmare. Had to queue for 40 minutes to check-in at Honolulu and though we boarded on time departure was delayed 45 minutes to due ""flight path"" issues we were told. Turns out the plane was overloaded and they removed some of the baggage including ours which they obviously knew about at Honolulu but didn't tell us. If they had we could have made our connecting flight at Sydney. Instead we were left to flounder at the carousel missed our flight and had to spend a night in Sydney along with maybe 50 others. Hawaiian paid for the hotel (20 km from the airport) and baggage arrived three days later but I won't be flying with them again if I have a choice.",4hawaiian-airlines,22/01/11,Disappointed that on a short flight between Honolulu and Maui we were charged 20 dollars a piece for two small bags that could have been carried on but for the fact we had to bring articles not allowed in the carry-on bags in the cabin. We will be charged the same to return - this is very cheap and I feel this airline is nickel and diming customers given the already high fares charged for inter island flights.,3hawaiian-airlines,15/01/11,Sydney to Honolulu return. Check-in at Sydney was good and flight on time. The staff SYD-HNL may as well not have been there. One female attendant was extremely unfriendly and really did not want to be there. Food was mediocre at best but it was an overnight flight so not so bad I guess as most of the time was spent sleeping! Honolulu to Sydney was the opposite. The staff went out of their way to oblige in all requests. Service with a smile and there was plenty of it. Drinks frequent meals were ok and flight went smoothly. It is an older style plane and not the most comfortable but I was prepared for all the little negatives.,6hawaiian-airlines,14/01/11,Helpful check-in people brilliant crew. Nice cabin clean fresh aircraft. Best economy airline in USA by a long way.,9hawaiian-airlines,09/01/11,LAS-HNL-LIH. Midnight madness flight out of Las Vegas at 1.40pm. We could not drop our bags until after midnight as they opened late had only two or three staff on hand and they were dealing with would be stand-bys leaving ticketed passengers to stand and wait and wait. Finally got onboard and got off. The new A330s are good planes. Seat back screens in all classes clean and as comfortable as economy gets. Arrived in Honolulu early morning and transferred over to the inter-island section. small plane arrived on time the flight over to Kaua'i was a mere 20 minutes but was so rough no beverage service was attempted. Not a problem. On the way back it was all pretty smooth. The meals/snacks on the long flights are small but very welcome. There were many drink rounds and the staff did appear to genuinely care about the customers. If only they could sort out staffing on the mainland!,7hawaiian-airlines,18/12/10,HNL to LAX on Boeing 767. I booked a window seat but for reason that I can't understand (my english was poor!) the staff asked me to seat in the middle seat of main line of seats with two fat men on each side of me. It was terrible They pressured me all time I was sleepy the flight was full and I had nowhere to move to.,3hawaiian-airlines,03/10/10,Sydney to Honolulu and purchased internal flights to Kahului and Hilo. SYD-HNL was good considering the price paid if you compare to other airlines offering the same route. The staff were friendly and attentive. The inter-island flights departed on time and the service was again enjoyable- and loved the views of the Hawaiian Islands.,8hawaiian-airlines,06/09/10,LAX-HNL-ITO return economy and first. LAX-HNL segment on an old but immaculate 767-300. Bulkhead row with plenty of legroom and enough room to change a nappy (diaper) on the floor. Hawaiian Airlines is the only US airline to offer complimentary food in all classes on domestic flights - food was quite tasty. The inflight entertainment was average - for $15 you can rent a cumbersome hand-held unit with 12-15 movies 12-15 TV programmes music videos and audio tracks. The $15 is pretty steep but it's better than standard IFE on other US airlines. HNL-ITO and ITO-HNL on B717-200s which have assigned seats and first class cabin. Service very good and beverages ae offered on the 40 minute flights. HNL-LAX segment with the new A330-200. We upgraded to first class for $300 per seat - recliner seats have adjustable legrests and footrests and recline to about 130 degrees. The controls are non-electronic and the legrests are a bit difficult to push back in place. Food service very good. Hawaiian's first class is very good value for flights to the USA but does not compete with Korean Qantas Delta or the Asian airlines on flights to the Pacific Rim. Service on all flights is cordial and friendly and FA's are more professional and customer-friendly than other US airlines.,8hawaiian-airlines,06/09/10,Sydney to Oahu Oahu to Las Vegas return. The crew were great. When we landed back in Hawaii from Vegas another passenger accidentally took my friends cabin bag. Within half an hour the crew had located the passenger (he was well on his way home along the freeway apparently.) The luggage was returned intact.,10hawaiian-airlines,21/08/10,SFO-HNL. Boarding procedure seemed a bit haphazard and gate area became crowded but eventually everyone boarded the plane. Gate staff friendly as were flight attendants. Premium meal offered both ways - this is a cashless airline so you need a credit card to pay for this. We were directed at SFO to use the self service check in but were advised not to do this or use online check in as we are international pax. As we are from the UK we did not have to pay any baggage fees to and from the Mainland (had to show check in staff our flight details from the UK). Hawaiian Airlines website unbelievably does not as yet have the ability to process applications from passengers in the UK so we used their UK based agent to book our flights. Flight back to SFO ten days later left late due to potential problem with aircraft (rectified on the ground). Hand baggage was weighed at check in at Honolulu but not at SFO.,5hawaiian-airlines,07/08/10,Flight crowded but ok. However very dissatisfied with Hawaiian Airlines baggage policy. If you are flying with them multiple times you have to wait 24 hours before each flight to prepay to save $2 that that offer for prepaying. So with 8 people traveling from New England to Hawaii not only are we not allowed one lousy piece of luggage but we can't even prepay unless we track down a computer in California and on each island that we visit because you are not allowed to call in to pay or to do it earlier than 24 hours. Our Luggage bill for each person to bring 1 piece of luggage adds up to $528. How ridiculous!,5hawaiian-airlines,26/07/10,Check-In was ok and that's about it. The crew were your typical US carrier and everyone was just a pain to them. They threw the meal bag and any request for a drink was treated with a grunt. They sat in the rear galley for the rest of the flight.,3hawaiian-airlines,21/07/10,Honolulu-Hilo-Honolulu on the same day. Low price flights on time good Boeing 717. Soft drink served on 40mins flight.,9hawaiian-airlines,16/07/10,I think this is one of the few airlines that still serves meals at no charge when flying from the mainland. Flight attendants were accomodating and helpful. No problems at all with check in flight left on time and we were as comfortable as one can be in economy class for a long flight.,9hawaiian-airlines,11/07/10,LAX-HNL-KOA return First Class. LAX Premier Club Lounge very small and basic with limited food and drink options. Transpacific flights on new A330 but old style reclining seats with a footrests a big let-down. IFE screen and choices very good. Catering quite tasty for domestic first class though quality was much higher out of LAX than HNL. Flight attendants professional and attentive. Inter-island first class is not value unless you're on a through fare. HNL airport is in serious need of a make-over - old poorly run counter-intuitive muted staff and barebones lounges. For a US carrier HA is not a bad operation but not all that special in any way either.,6hawaiian-airlines,30/06/10,LAX-HNL roundtrip First class on new A330. Good seat and legroom though expected more recline for newer plane that they plan to use for future international routes. Service was great! Meal was good (get to pick 3 of 5 choices on menu). IFE great enjoyed the selection of movies and programming. Flew coach back on new A330 and pretty impressed - more legroom and slightly better recline than older Hawaiian 767s. Have to pay for movies/videos on IFE in coach though. One of the few domestic airlines that still serve complimentary meals in coach.,8hawaiian-airlines,05/06/10,Las Vegas to Honolulu  good on time flight coach seating adequate best seats for legroom are 26AC or 26HJ on Boeing 767 aircraft. First Class seating looked good but not worth paying anything over $250 for upgrades on US Mainland to Hawaii flights would obviously be happy to pay more for longer distance flights. Good choice of meal you can have a free meal or choose to pay for an upgraded meal which I did and was a good move free coffees and soft drinks. Very friendly and smiling cabin crew great start to Hawaiian trip.,8hawaiian-airlines,01/06/10,Sydney to Honolulu flight was most uncomfortable seating. Temperature in the cabin was extremely warm and unbearable. On our return flight a more comfortable trip seating wise but the cabin was extremely cold throughout the 10 hour flight. Even the thin blankets supplied did not do us any good. Everyone was dragging out extra jackets to put on. The aircraft also left from the domestic terminal and we were unable to take advantage of buying duty free there because no one told us prior that once we booked in we couldn't get to the International Terminal to purchase goods. All international flights should leave from the International Terminal.,4hawaiian-airlines,27/05/10,Honolulu to Las Vegas. Very helpful guy at Honolulu airport got us through the boarding process fast this seemed to set the standard on our flight everything went well. I have flown on a number of American airlines any this flight was as good as I have had to date. The food is typical USA airline style but far from the worst I have had. Only one complaint this was the coldest flight I have ever been on in over 35 years of flying it is the first time I have ever found it necessary to wrap myself in an airline blanket 90% of the passengers were similarly wrapped in blankets. My wife asked why the plane was so cold but none of the crew seemed to know.,7hawaiian-airlines,25/05/10,"SFO-HNL-KOA and back. Hawaiian advertises their outstanding service and free meals and beverages. They kept changing our flights and departure times I had to call them and rebook us on a flight that would not arrive 8 hours later than the flight I paid for. At the airport (SFO) there was no gate information we had to ask our way through to find out which the departure gate is. When we started boarding there was still no gate information. The staff seemed to be very unmotivated they had different groups for boarding but no one actually enforced that. By the time we got to our seats almost everyone in front of us was already there and all luggage bins were full. Hidden charges: You have to pay extra for each piece of luggage you want to check in. On the way to KOA no one cared about our carry-on luggage. BUT on the way back they were inspecting every single piece of luggage checking the measurements and the weight. If it was larger or heavier than the allowed size/weight for carry-on items you had to check it in (and pay of course). The meals nothing special I probably would have been better off with home made sandwiches. It was not worth the higher price we paid. On the plane the service was okay I wouldn't call it outstanding you get the same service as on almost any other airline. On the ground the service was very bad - staff very unhelpful and unfriendly. Hawaiian's ""service"" doesn't make up for the higher air fare that you are paying. flying with United or Alaska Airlines when you fly to Hawaii. The have direct flights to certain islands this way you don't waste your time in Honolulu waiting for a connecting flight.",hawaiian-airlines,18/05/10,MNL-SEA and LAS-MNL. Overall a disappointing experience and we won't make the mistake of booking it again. It was really like taking a domestic US flight across the Pacific when there are so many options on international airlines. The service amenities and aircraft are not comparable. Manila check-in was ok but they had problems with non-working printers and were unable to print all of our boarding passes (they told us to just pick up the last one in HNL because they couldn't figure it out). We boarded the 20+ year-old 767 with overhead bins sized from the 80's no IFE and ageing cabin. The flight attendants all appeared to be senior and had a lot of attitude. We overheard one flight attendant insult an elderly passenger behind her back because the passenger requested to change her new blanket which had hairs on it. The mocking and poor attitude of flight attendants which other reviewers below referred to was true on our flight. To watch movies they rented personal DVD players for $15 per segment. With a change of plane in HNL that meant 4 segments round-trip or $60 per person to watch movies. When we inquired if there was a seafood option (the only choices were chicken and pork) the flight attendant replied they used to have special meals but no longer offer them. On the return flight from LAS we stopped over in HNL for a night but were charged baggage fees for that segment because it was technically a domestic flight - $25 per bag. Finally we took off from HNL-MNL and weren't in the air for 30 minutes when the captain announced a faulty generator requiring us to return to HNL (again a 20+ year-old 767). However we had to burn fuel first so we flew in circles at 7000 ft for 4 hours with the landing gear and flaps fully extended - an uncomfortable ride. The flight attendants were plain combative with understandably worried and upset passengers. Six hours later we landed in HNL again. They arranged another plane with a new crew and we arrived in MNL 8 hours late. To make matters worse they left behind baggage of at least 50 passengers in HNL so there was an ugly queue of irate passengers at 2:30 am after an 8 hour delay. We received our luggage two days later. We wrote a letter to Hawaiian but they did not respond. All in all if we had flown on CX or KE or OZ via HKG or SEL to the mainland we could've avoided a tremendous amount of hassle (eg. having to collect your bags and check-in again in HNL) being nickel and dimed (eg. luggage fees and DVD rental fees) poor service (being insulted by flight attendant) and delays from old faulty aircraft. I should also mention I felt bad for the business class passengers who paid $2000+ for their seats. The seats in business class are domestic US first class seats - very little recline and leg room. You have many choices and until Hawaiian actually starts caring about their transpacific passengers we are not flying them again.,hawaiian-airlines,10/05/10,First Class LAX to HNL-LIH. First class was mediocre. The first class cabin was quite crowded seats weren't that large. Nothing was electric on the seat an older manual style. The entertainment consisted of small video units passed out to each passenger -entertainment choice was terrible. The food was ok drinks were fine. The staff was exceptionally nice and the cabin was clean. It was all quite mundane and functional.,6hawaiian-airlines,10/04/10,Honolulu to Manila. They made us wait for hours outside the boarding area by the hallway with no seats- in Honolulu. They only let us in the boarding area room when it was time for us to board the plane. In Manila they only have 3-people checking in. It took me 2.5 hours to get checked in. There were a lot of empty seats at the back and they would not let any of us transfer since they are all reserved for their attendants - one whole row for each attendant. It doesn't make any sense - we were all cramped in the forward cabin and every time I use the bathrooms at the back - these reserved seats were not used by the attendants. I overheard the attendants congregating at the back making fun of the Filipino passengers - they copied their strong accents and made fun of their requests. I thought that this was so unprofessional. I guess because the fare is cheaper you get cheaper service. The only thing I like about the flight is its direct flight - the schedule is so convenient. Food is average nothing special.,1hawaiian-airlines,22/02/10,SYD-HNL-SYD on B767-300. Very pleasant flight with good service entertainment and food. Comfortable seats with very good leg room. Cabin crew polite and friendly. Cabin kept clean. Plenty of water offered during flight.,9hawaiian-airlines,08/02/10,"SJC-HNL-LIH. I booked our flight 3 months in advance - only to find a month later that the company offered a Hawaiian Plus fare for $200 per ticket cheaper than the ones I had purchased. This Plus fare included 2 free checked bags as well! The Hawaiian Plus fare was not even offered at the time I made the reservation. The checked baggage for our trip will cost an additional $100! When talking to customer service and asking that our bag fee be waived I was told by the service representative and supervisor that they could not do this. It is amazing that the two service representative did not recognize how the airline ""Policy"" makes little sense. Future travel on this airline is highly doubtful. The trip was to celebrate my wife 50th birthday and all I can do cross my fingers and hope the rest of the experience with Hawaii will be positive.",1jetblue-airways,26/07/15,We travelled from Orlando to New York JFK on JetBlue Airways and I would like to congratulate the crew and the airline. The crew were very kind to us and we felt that they gave us special attention which made our journey a very pleasant one. Thank you and we definitely will travel with you again and highly recommend you.,10jetblue-airways,23/07/15,"Unable to handle problems, our flight was delayed, then cancelled. Staff not able to communicate clearly. Any problems and this airline falls apart. Had to wait until next day to fly out. ",1jetblue-airways,23/07/15,"We travelled to Orlando from the UK for a week stay then decided that we wanted to visit Mexico. So we went to a JetBlue travel desk within Orlando International and booked a return ticket to Cancun. The staff were helpful at the desk and the whole boarding procedure was quick and straightforward. On board, our seats were roomy, there was free wifi and TV's in the seat, for a 1hour 50min flight. We even received a free drink and snack. My husband watched football. I thought the cabin crew were presented well and they seem to have much more personality than any other airline I have recently travelled on. I was amazed that Jetblue is considered Budget as it is in a whole other league to the UK budget airline Easyjet. I would fly with them again.",10jetblue-airways,21/07/15,First time flying with jetblue and will fly again. Thanks for a comfortable flight.,10jetblue-airways,18/07/15,"Both flights to Puerto Rico and back were pleasant. On time and services were great. However, on my way back home, I had a back injury that flared up during the trip and the people from Jetblue were great in assisting me with a wheelchair from beginning to end. I will definately recommend them and use their service in the future. ",10jetblue-airways,17/07/15,Twice a year for 9 years my wife and I fly to family in California and it is a full day trip. We are both handicapped and it has always been hard on us and we were always made to feel like a burden by airlines employees. This year we took Jetblue for the nonstop flight even though Boston airport is over an hours drive. Customer service addressed our special needs from the very start with booking the flight over the phone to finish getting our luggage there and back home and I didn't feel helpless about having a disability. ,9jetblue-airways,17/07/15,"My Jetblue flight was canceled 2 hourse before departure. They rescheduled me on a flight 7 hours later, and I found a flight on another airline. The return was on Jetblue. When I went online to select a seat, I was presented with a grand total of 0 seats from which to chose without paying the upgrade fee. How could there be 0 seats when I don't have one?  Next flight planned a couple of weeks in advance. Go online to pick a seat -  0 seats available! I don't get a seat until I get to the airport - last row, middle seat. On the return leg, I go online again and zip. So I call customer service. After 10 minutes on hold, I explain and am told that it's because I got on the site late. Well, it's not a problem, you'll get a seat. Sure I will, last row, middle, perhaps? After a few minutes of snarky attitude I ask for a supervisor. Literally 25 minutes later I hung up without ever speaking to a supervisor. ",1jetblue-airways,15/07/15,"We fly JetBlue about 3 times a year, and every time it's satisfying. The legroom is great in even more space, the television is great for entertainment and they actually give you something more than peanuts. Also, every here and there the flight is over two hours and you can get eat up's (which include cheese up, meat up and many more). ",8jetblue-airways,13/07/15,"MSY to BOS on 6th July. I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process - they assign seats upon arrival at the gate, and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance. Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them. We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare, gate staff could not have been more helpful. We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch. There was an on-ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington, but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take-off (why doesn't every airline do that), we barely noticed. ",8jetblue-airways,10/07/15,"Our flight was delayed because of a mechanical error and I was okay until they suggested my family of 4 go on a flight the next day. It was our first vacation in 3 years, and my dad saved up 3 years worth of vacation days for this trip. They offered to give us Jetblue vouchers. Period. Our hotel, rental car, and vacation plan fees were thrown down the toilet, and they only offered vouchers. Like I'll ever ride on Jetblue again. Also, they acted like they were doing a huge favor by saying our delayed flight was paid by them. We didn't get a refund so we just paid for a later flight. This infuriated me and I tried to explain that it wasn't free for us, and the woman from Jetblue kept saying it was paid by them. So I asked if I could get a refund for the original flight and they said no. I was so mad but couldn't cancel because of the fees for hotel, car, food, and other reservations weren't refundable. It was just an overall horrible experience and ended up in two of us in tears. ",1jetblue-airways,02/07/15,"Comically mismanaged operation. Problems began when the departure gate was mobbed- seems an earlier flight had 'technical problems', so it departed an hour late at my original gate. We were then redirected to an alternate gate, and waited. And waited. And waited. They now had us waiting on the plane with 'technical problems' and they basically had the other flight go out with our intended jet, and we were stuck. It took text message from my daughter thousands of miles away to inform me the flight was finally cancelled. Not one word from JetBlue staff at the boarding gate. Finally, 2 hours after scheduled departure, they announced baggage was at the carousel, and ""being monitored by JetBlue associates"" I went down to claim my bag - no JetBlue staff in sight. I quickly went to ticketing, got an apology and refund from the embarrassed support staff, and proceeded to Southwest, where I ended up having to pay +$500 more for their next direct flight with a confirmed seat. I understand this is a mechanical industry and there will be problems, but it's how an airline manages the problem that is a mark of their business integrity and customer focus. How a major airline doesn't keep a backup vessel on site is mind boggling to me, let alone the abject lack of communication to the paying customer.",1jetblue-airways,01/07/15,"It was the first time my children had flown, so I wanted it to be good. From the beginning, JetBlue kept me happy. I had TSA precheck when we arrived, and I didn't ask for it. When we boarded the plane, we boarded first because we had a small child. There was no extra charge for this. Our flight took off 20 min early so we arrived early. During the flight, we were quickly offered snacks and a drink. The attendant came around selling ear buds for $5 to use with the TV at each seat. Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable. At the end of the flight, deplaning was just as pleasant. The price was also better than anyone else, and there were no problems with my luggage. One more thing-my very picky husband who is 6'3"" had plenty of legroom. We did not upgrade to even more space, but he still had plenty of legroom and was very comfortable in a normal seat!",1jetblue-airways,27/06/15,"It started out good with complimentary baggage check, drink, and a snack; however on the return flight things quickly changed to bad. Beware of cheap flights - you pay for what you get! Flight delayed an hour, then sat  for 2 hours due to mechanical reasons.  This company is not considerate of customers or handicap customers and worst they do not partner with domestic airlines - only international airlines therefore if you miss your flight you are out of luck until the next one.

First, while we waited to board the flight, the woman at counter announced: ""We are having trouble locating our flight crew, sorry for the delay"" (about 15 min. at this time).  Another 10 min. goes by and she announces: ""We know our crew is here somewhere because they flew in, we hope it is just a few more min.""  The third time she said ""we have located our crew and it should only be about 10-15 more min. until boarding.""  We finally board the plane and we never hear from our captain until ""prepare for landing.""

Not allowed to select seat assignment when checking in online evening before flights (unless paying for premium seats) poor attitude from airline staff at DCA when I expressed frustration. While speaking with an agent another interrupted the conversation offering his unsolicited opinion. Funny seated dead last group 3 in last available seat. Coincidence? Please note staff at CHS very kind.,1jetblue-airways,27/04/15,Flew from SFO-JFK and return flight on JetBlue. Both flights left on time and we arrived at both destinations about 30 minutes early. The crew on the flight was attentive and very friendly. Both on the way to New York and back to SF they asked us about ourselves and our trip. The A321 they fly on trans con flights has a snack bar they open up after they come through with the first round of drinks. It's great being able to get up and get your own snacks without having to call a flight attendant. The entertainment was pretty standard they have live TV and movies you can purchase for $5. The flight crew were also informative. We had a pretty intense bout of turbulence but the captain continued to update passengers the whole time.,10jetblue-airways,23/04/15,The seat and legroom were excellent. On our flight to Puerto Rico from Chicago we felt the cabin crew were less than exceptional. Drinks came but the snack/food service was much later. They didn't pick up the refuse for a long time. We didn't sense that the crew enjoyed their jobs. The entertainment controls did not function on either of our seats. We were not able to take advantage of the entertainment. On the return leg of our trip the crew was marginally better. We purchased headphones but after about an hour my aisle seat controls stopped working. my wife's center seat controls never worked at all. We were happy with the overall flight otherwise. It was nice to be able to get more than a tiny bag of peanuts.,6jetblue-airways,28/03/15,LAX-BOS A320. Boarding zones were a bit strung out although not helped by the people who would show up to the gate as boarding was going on but should have sped it up. On board everything went smoothly. Quick to take-off so was must not have lost our slot. Crew was above par and standard Jetblue entertainment product and snacks. At least one lady in the row in front of me had a TV that did not work so they reset the system. Not a big deal but if you purchased content and already watching that would be a huge pain. Going to miss when they reduce the pitch as the 34' current is great. Arrived slightly early but the crew seemed a bit disinterested to passengers as departing. However minor point. 9/10.,9jetblue-airways,28/03/15,Flight 906 on 3/17 and 905 on 3/22. I booked a trip to NYC from Chicago and I chose JetBlue based on price and time of flight. Since I'm a student and I was on a budget and I mainly based my decision on price. It was $220 round-trip. I had really low expectations given that this airline is not a big name like others out there but I'm happy to say I had an excellent experience. Both my flights were on time they offered free snacks (no peanuts here legit snacks!) and soda/tea/coffee. The service and the whole experience was great. I would definitely recommend JetBlue.,10jetblue-airways,28/03/15,"My husband and I decided to take a spontaneous trip to San Francisco for my birthday. As we were making travel arrangements to return back to the Miami area JetBlue had the only flight that worked with our time schedule. We were hesitant to book the flight with JetBlue because we did not know much about the company. We decided to give JetBlue a chance and booked flight #578 from SFO to FLL on March 14 2015. It is unfortunate that we did not have a good experience on our first JetBlue flight. The electrical system had issues. The TV on the back of the seats worked at the beginning of the flight but slowly the TVs started going out throughout the cabin (our row did not have a working TV the majority of the 5 hour flight). This made me question what other electrical issues this plane might have. Not only did we have electrical issues but we did not have running water on the flight. My husband and I are both in the medical field and we feel this is not only inconvenient but unsanitary. The ""solution"" was to place multiple bottles of water in the restroom for customers to wash their hands. Partially used and soiled water bottles to wash our hands is not exactly our idea of sanitary. Since the plane did not have running water my husband and I decided to avoid using the restroom for over a 5 hour flight. It also made us question the cleanliness of the flight attendants' hands provided the lack of water on the plane. This is a huge unsanitary issue that should never occur on a plane.",jetblue-airways,09/03/15,I chose JetBlue because I heard great things. I think I had an unlucky streak in which both of my flights were delayed. One being a leaky valve and the second due to weather (out-of-JetBlues control). JetBlue worked really hard to keep me happy and remain their customer. They provided me a credit no questions asked since the delays affected my transportation routes. For them to do that shows that this type of thing does not happen very often. I will also say that the unlimited snacks beverages not to mention all the leg room was a plus. Although I did not have a perfect experience I would definitely recommend JetBlue. Things happen but JetBlue owns up to it and works hard to keep you a satisfied customer. I respect that and their business model of good customer service. I bet if I didn't have the delays the experience would have been perfect.,6jetblue-airways,24/02/15,We just did the Jetblue Mint experience LAX to JFK. We are a couple of airline geeks who took this flight as a Valentines Day gift to each other. Our dedicated Mint flight crew greeted us warmly during boarding including a welcome card with their names. Also waiting at our seats were eye masks and bottled water. Before takeoff we each enjoyed a couple of their delicious signature drinks (they're small). After takeoff we were offered more drinks a Birchbox full of gender specific spa products and dinner. Out of 5 or 6 items we were permitted to choose 3 small plates an appetizer and dessert. Honestly I found some of the food excellent and some not quite as good. They were more than happy to replace one of my choices that I wasn't too happy with. The entertainment was great live TV and free wifi. The movies are not on-demand which made it so that I wasn't able to watch one because I was too distracted with the rest of the Mint experience to pay attention to the start times. In case dinner doesn't fill you the A321 has a self-serve snack bar behind the Mint cabin for anytime bagged snacks and drinks. The seats themselves were comfortable for a 5 hour domestic flight. I liked the firmness controls and massage feature. We sat in a 2 seat bank so we could sit together but the single suites looked very nice for people traveling alone. The single seats have more personal space and a privacy door too. Jetblue really thought our the Mint product well. If you book enough in advance the introductory price is a terrific value. Even last minute bookings still price Mint competitively with UA DL and AA on this route.,10jetblue-airways,24/02/15,I was scheduled to leave at 8.35 am. There was an issue with the plane and the flight was delayed until 10.00am. We were finally on the plane when the flight was cancelled due to weather. The flight would have made it if we had left on time (the DC airport closed at 1.00 pm). I was rebooked for a new flight the following day. The flight left at 1.00 pm took me to Boston then arrived in DC at 10.00pm. (My original flight was direct.) I was told the airline would not provide accommodations for the night because it was a weather and not a technical difficulty that cancelled the flight of course the weather only became an issue because of the technical difficulty. I went back to the airport early the following morning and was able to book a direct flight to DC that departed at 6.55. I tried to fly standby on the two earlier flight without success. Although this is terrible the worst part was the gate agents. They didn't have the decency to tell me that the flight was full and just walked away from the desk after boarding the flight. Then when I checked in for my 6.55 flight (I hadn't been assigned a seat that morning) they were rude again. I will not fly JetBlue again.,jetblue-airways,19/01/15,Flew jetBlue Mint class New York to LA and return. Overall a great experience. Was seated in 2A one of four 'single suites.' Very comfortable and private especially when reclined with the suite door closed. The only picky comment is there tends to be some wasted space owing to the single seat configuration and the design could have accommodated a greater seat width. You're also removed from the window so mindless gazing is not really an option unless you unbuckle and lean. The perks in Mint are outstanding not just the lie-flat seat with massage feature but the food and beverage selection amenity kit service from the flight staff and the large video screen. As mentioned in previous reviews not touch screen but that didn't really detract from the experience - you couldn't even reach the screen necessarily when fully reclined. Okay selection of feature films but not VOD. The DirecTV feed is great however and really gives no reason to claim you're bored. The wi-fi complimentary at the moment was hit and miss; fairly good responsiveness when working but did suffer from numerous interruptions. Personalized and attentive service was prominent on both legs and flight time seemingly flew (no pun intended) by. At the current introductory price point Mint is outstanding value. Inevitably jetBlue will adjust their fare pricing to reflect the reality of what is offered however even at a higher cost Mint class should be seriously considered before looking at intercontinental business class on other airlines. jetBlue and its staff should be proud of the Mint product and I will look for any excuse to fly Mint class again.,10jetblue-airways,19/01/15,Buffalo to New York - JFK with a connection to Los Angeles (read the latter segment under a separate review). The flight from Buffalo left and arrived on time. The Even More Space seats are very good with plenty of leg room while also providing the benefit of early boarding. Flight crew was personable and attentive. As a first timer with JetBlue I was impressed. Will definitely fly with them again. Great alternative to a Canadian airline out of Toronto for me.,10jetblue-airways,14/01/15,JFK-LAX. Mint Service. Like other reviews of this new First Class Jet blue service it is excellent. Overall it ranked higher than most excellent business class carriers and felt more like BA First which I had just flew in on. The level of the service is high as well as the experience. Meals are better than most carriers and was completely impressed. What I liked the most was the Suite which was private and comfortable with plenty of room for a bed with great bedding. Was completely surprised by this level of service in US. The only downside was the movies were not running but there was plenty of other options. The amenities kit and head set are all top notch. They give American and Virgin a run for the money and considering this service is so well priced I will be flying again!,10jetblue-airways,05/01/15,In December 2014 I took two separate jetBlue flights one from SFO to JFK and then another from JFK to LAX. These flights were fairly long (5 hours) and I found the service to be quite sterile and mediocre. While it was nice that snacks and drinks were made available throughout the flight there were no healthy options aside from water and if you were not prepared to purchase a meal on board chips and cookies were basically your only options for the flight. I feel that this is standard for a flight that may be 1 or 2 hours long but for a longer 5 hour trip I expect there to be meal service included in the price of the fare. I also suffered from severe pain in my right ear during and after landing on both these flights which I had not experienced on another domestic US flight with a different airline that I had taken around the same time nor on any other flight I have had prior or after these two jetBlue ones.,6jetblue-airways,05/01/15,Just arrived in NYC (LGA) from Fort Myers with my 3 kids and husband. We were really impressed by our experiences on outgoing and returning flights. Great satisfaction with all aspects of travel - boarding inflight service (healthy food and beverage choices entertainment communication service spacious seats and storage).,10jetblue-airways,18/12/14,JFK-IAD ERJ-195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom. It was a short flight of about 50 minutes. There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight. You can switch channels to news such as CNN. The flight has snacks and cola for complimentary. It is the best experience I have had on short flight.,9jetblue-airways,10/12/14,"R/T JFK to LIR (Liberia Costa Rica) in Even More Space seats. The EMS seats entitle you to shorter waiting time at the TSA checkpoint which we needed since we were a little late arriving to JFK. We purchased food to bring on board but ""boxes"" are availlable. No Eat Up Cafe (fresh food) is sold on this flight. The EMS seats have lots of leg room which is great. Our flight attendants both ways were friendly and efficient and complimentary snacks and beverages available at all times. Since we were on an international flight the movies were free but they charge $3 for headphones (which I feel JB should comp for the EMS rows). Overall a great experience. We use this service twice annually to visit our home in CR.",10jetblue-airways,20/11/14,Flew between New York JFK and Fort Myers. Checked in online and bag drop at JFK was quick and easy. Flight left on time was 45 mins quicker than originally advised. Leg room was excellent much better than most international airlines complimentary in flight soft drinks and snacks all in all a very good experience and we will use Jetblue again.,10jetblue-airways,12/11/14,I flew from Boston to Philadelphia with Jetblue on Monday August 25th. The Airline was punctual and the seats were decent. Great airline to use domestically.,8jetblue-airways,03/11/14,Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience. We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out. We arrived at JFK 10 minutes earlier than scheduled and were very happy with our experience. Book early for extreme good value and highly recommend the Mint class to anyone looking for a fantastic First class experience at an affordable price.,10jetblue-airways,22/10/14,HPN-MCO. No complaints seats were roomy. Check in was easy both ways. Great entertainment as you could actually watch live TV. No meals offered (short flight). Basic refreshments. Good value!,9jetblue-airways,22/10/14,Took flight 1834 from Port-au-Prince to JFK on 10/17/14. What a great experience - almost. The personnel were exceptional. They did everything right. My seat was 1D since no one was in the exit row seats they let me move back and allowed my friend in coach to move next to me he is 6 ft 3 so that was great for him. The attendants were on their game the whole trip and got me coffee after their normal serving time without a hitch. Only problem was my seat sound connection crackled so I used the seat connection next to me. No problem as long as no one is directly next to you.,10jetblue-airways,20/10/14,I travel a fair amount (7-10 trips a year for biz and pleasure). I am fine with zero amenties for short hauls but I am sorry Boston - San Diego is a long flight. I paid $90 extra for leg room and was still jammed in like a sardine. There was nothing to eat except junk food (salt or sugar) or a cardboard sandwich for purchase. No free wine or beer. If I wanted a cheap blanket and pillow for the red-eye home I had to BUY it (and then had to own it) - I traveled to this business meeting with one carry on - what am I supposed to do with my new jetblue bedding? Talk about a throwaway anti-environmental business model. I had to pay for TV if I wanted it - only good thing is free wifi. I paid over $900 for the ticket. Jet Blue should not treat their transcontinental flyers like this. I would not recommend JB to anyone taking a trip longer than 90 minutes and I would only use them again if I could find no other carrier going to the destination.,4jetblue-airways,08/10/14,On board Mint class from LAX to JFK. Impressive in all aspects. Seat entertainment food and service. The other carriers better watch out. Provided the pricing remains competitive I'm a convert.,10jetblue-airways,28/09/14,We arrived at the airport before 2pm - our flight was at 9.45 pm. Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge. We had the chance to take the flight at 2.40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge $50 per person (group of 4) instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours. I travel a lot because of my business and I have never had this issue with other airlines.,3jetblue-airways,28/09/14,I recently traveled round trip from Boston to Orlando. I traveled out of Boston on September 14 2014 and we were about 20 minutes delayed leaving Boston due to the late arrival of the inbound flight. I have to say it was a great flight and the pilot made up time arriving in Orlando for an on-time arrival the crew were great plenty of legroom plenty of drinks and snacks. The overall flight to Orlando was excellent. Coming home to Boston yesterday was a different story the male flight attendant on the Orlando-Boston route was extremely rude. No smile as we boarded the aircraft no hello to the passengers just miserable. I traveled with 2 friends on board the flight and the tray table was defective and the soda went all over my friends pants. I went to ask this flight attendant for some paper towels and he rudely said get back to your seat because there was turbulence. I understand the safety protocols when it comes to turbulence but at least take initiative to the passengers requests. There was no apology from him for this defective tray table. A female flight attendant who was so nice came to our aid.,4jetblue-airways,17/09/14,We arrived at the airport before 2pm - our flight was at 9.45 pm. Usually when you arrive so far in advance JetBlue try to accommodate you on an earlier flight with no charge. We had the chance to take the flight at 2.40pm JetBlue had space on that flight but they wanted to charge $50 per person (group of 4) instead they put us on stand by for 7 hours. I travel a lot because of my business and I have never had this issue with other airlines.,3jetblue-airways,09/09/14,Flew LAX-JFK return in Mint in Aug/Sep 2014. Check in was fast and efficient although slightly hard to find the Mint line at JFK. The food is some of the best I've had inflight and beats any of the other American airlines I've flown hands down. The seat was slightly narrow but the adjustable firmness and subtle massage made up for it. Warm and efficient friendly cabin crew were very helpful but unobtrusive. Flight to JFK departed 50 minutes late but landed on time. Entertainment system is not on demand and the DirecTV has so many advertisements it is infuriating. The feature movies were ad free though. Overall a very good airline who I would definitely fly with again.,10jetblue-airways,06/09/14,Flew on Jet Blue 1732 from Bermuda to JFK on Sunday 31/8/2014. Boarding was speedy well organised and efficient with everyone boarded and the plane doors closed 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight left Bermuda 15 minutes early and arrived into JFK 25 minutes early which impressed me a lot. Service provided by three polite smiling and delightful crew with drinks and snack run done fairly effortlessly and refills available and delivered with extra ice and a smile. An impressive service that I really rated.,9jetblue-airways,28/08/14,"I'm writing about JetBlue's check-in operations at Fort Lauderdale airport. Apparently they have grown their operations there with insufficient and / or unmotivated staff. Trying to check in a bag for a recent flight to JFK took 45 minutes finally being called out of the line and being told ""you are too late"". All this while the lines got longer and their staff stood around chatting. Out of 13 desks 6 were open while I counted at least 9 JetBlue staff hanging around doing nothing except chat. Finally got to the gate only for their personnel there not having a clue about getting passengers onboard in a logical order. They need to up their game at FLL or this passenger will be using another carrier next time. On board service was good friendly and helpful which did mitigate some of the bad feeling about the FLL ground experience.",4jetblue-airways,28/08/14,I flew on flight 1731 from JFK to Bermuda. The flight was delayed so boarding started around 30 minutes late. Boarding was pretty chaotic as the PA system was not working properly. Onboard we were greeted by a friendly cabin supervisor who smiled and asked us how we were. Once seated the flight was airborne within 20 minutes an hour later than scheduled. Inflight service was efficient and friendly with drinks served individually from a tray rather than a trolley which was a nice touch with a free snack served from a basket. Landing cards were handed out - it would be great if they had a supply of pens. The flight then arrived around 30 minutes late into Bermuda disembarkment was quick - and I have to say I really enjoyed the flight.,9jetblue-airways,28/08/14,August 20 2014 flight 124. We flew from LAX to JFK on Mint. I can honestly say that I was very impressed! I have flown business class on many international airlines and the on-board service was comparable in every way. The food was excellent - best I have had on any airline. Flight attendants were friendly courteous and very attentive and our bags were the first to arrive at the carousel as promised. Furthermore the seats reclined to a flat position. All in all a great trip. The one suggestion for JetBlue is to have a small lounge area to accommodate Mint customers at larger airports such as LAX.,10jetblue-airways,26/08/14,Aug 17 New York (JFK) to Orlando Intl (MCO) Flight 883. First time I've flown with JetBlue and it was not a pleasant experience. Told the flight delayed 15 minutes then another 15 minutes and so on. The plane was at the wrong terminal and took them over an hour to get it to the right gate! Boarding process was a farce very slow. 'Snack' was a packet of Doritos served by miserable cabin crew. De-boarding also very slow and then waited ages for our luggage. Only good points were that we got there in one piece and they have good leg room.,1jetblue-airways,26/08/14,First time I've flown with JetBlue and very unimpressed. Plane over one hour late slow boarding slow off- boarding poor service waited ages for luggage. Only good point is the legroom in coach class.,1jetblue-airways,14/08/14,Flew from St. Maarten to JFK New York. An announcement came over the loud speaker asking if anyone wanted an upgrade. I mistakenly thought that meant an upgrade to first class. So I paid an extra $150 for my children and I to upgrade only to find out that I paid $150 for approximately a foot and a half extra leg room. I would have never spent my hard earned money on that and I believe that should've been explained to me. I will never fly jetBlue again.,jetblue-airways,03/08/14,Terrible airline! I fly often with other airlines usually Southwest. I've never waited so long to get my luggage 45 minutes one way and 50 on way home! That's after my flight was delayed by almost an hour waiting on a flight crew! Fly someone else if at all possible!,1jetblue-airways,29/07/14,Flew Mint class from LAX to JFK in July. Check in and boarding smooth and on time. Fantastic crew helpful and kind yet unobtrusive. Meal some of the best I've had inflight much better than BA and QR business long haul. Entertainment system not AVOD so whenever announcements were made I'd miss parts of the film I was watching. Good selection of entertainment though wifi never worked. Seat was the suite-style and very comfortable in all positions but surprisingly narrow in lie-flat. When trying to sleep I had to keep my arms over my chest like a mummy. Still managed to doze off a few hours.,9jetblue-airways,22/07/14,Was flying for work from Tampa to DC and back. Good direct connection into Reagan at good prices so went for it. The flight to DC was uneventful and pleasant. A week later as I am returning I have checked in at DC and waiting at the gate when I get an email from my booking service provider 10 minutes before boarding time that my flight is cancelled. No announcements at the gate or anything. It just now has been changed from Tampa to Boston. 25 minutes later they announce to go to another gate to see attendants for help. After waiting nearly an hour to talk to the agents I am greeted by two very unhelpful or sympathetic agents. Our flight was cancelled because there was a mechanical failure on the plane scheduled for Boston so they used the Tampa plane instead. This information came from other customers in line who got it from their booking agents - not the Jetblue agents serving us. They tell me they can get me out two days later and if I want to get to Tampa the next day my best option is to cancel the return leg and book another flight with another airline as JetBlue doesn't have any partnerships. So I go ahead and do that. Book a flight for $300 with American for the next am and go to baggage drop area to collect my bag I had checked in earlier. There I was told I could get vouchers toward the hotel dinner etc. I collect my bag and am told by the agent there that since I cancelled my flight with JetBlue it is not in their hands any more and they can't compensate hotel etc. She did offer me a $12 voucher to use toward snacks at the airport. All in all this episode cost me an extra $400 (extra hotel cabs new ticket). I understand mechanical failures happen. I travel a lot all of the world. I was surprised how little these agents at the gate knew about how to handle people when their company is obviously letting them down. A dull blank emotionless stare and the customers had to suggest alternate satisfactory solutions. No proactive support.,jetblue-airways,20/07/14,I've flown Jetblue twice the first one was a good experience with no delays snacks beverages and nice crew. The second one was terrible: our flight JFK-FLL was at 6am and we got to the airport at 1am the screens showed that our flight was cancelled and we waited until 3.30am to receive any attention from JetBlue staff. They said that we would need to wait until tomorrow for another flight or we would need to go to LaGuardia Airport to take another flight in 2 hours offered no accommodation transportation to LGA or vouchers. We had to take a taxi from JFK to LGA. Fortunately we got our flight on time from LGA to FLL but we are really disappointed with this drawback. I think this is the last time we will fly Jetblue.,5jetblue-airways,06/07/14,My son boarded a JetBlue flight in SF at 5.59am on July 2 bound for Portland ME connecting at JFK in NYC. The flight was diverted to Rochester N.Y where it sat for 8 hours. A JB agent in Rochester changed his connecting flight to Portland without checking to see if his connecting flight was on time (in fact it too was delayed). When he finally arrived at JFK at 11.30am he found that the new connecting flight on which he was re-routed had been cancelled. His original connecting flight however was the scheduled to depart JFK at 2.30 am. Ultimately his original connecting flight was also cancelled. The JB customer assistance desk was completely vacant and there were hour-long waits on the phone. A single gate agent was attempting to assist and her line was 100 feet long. When he reached her she said his only option was a flight leaving at 10.30 pm on July 3. He finally obtained a seat on a flight to Boston departing at 11 am. Eight hours later he walked past a gate at JFK that showed a flight to Portland at 1.30 pm which was never mentioned by the gate agent the previous night. He managed to get on the flight. All in all the worst nightmare air travel story I've ever heard. Never fly on JetBlue.,jetblue-airways,03/07/14,Flew JFK-ACK-JFK very easy check-in very comfortable Embraer 190 plane service on board was excellent both flights left on time. I'll keep flying JetBlue whenever I can. The seats were very comfortable.,10jetblue-airways,03/07/14,JFK-POS. Unfortunately Jetblue has lost its edge and is now very similar to the other U.S. carriers. The free snacks have been downgraded and are really cheap and not substantial enough for longer flights. The majority of the flight attendants were friendly but one of them was extremely rude. The seats however are pretty good (much more comfortable than coach seats on the legacy carriers).,7jetblue-airways,01/07/14,Very decent airline with great staff. I flew MCO-JFK and the whole flight was great. I also found the food and snacks acceptable and the WIFI was great. I would definitely fly Jetblue again.,9jetblue-airways,25/06/14,My husband and I flew from Charleston to DCA on the second day of service 6/20. The flight plane crew seat snacks were excellent. Jetblue on this flight provided directtv service which was great. I have flown Delta US Air United recently. None of these were as good as the Jetblue service. I was extremely impressed and have already booed my next flight.,10jetblue-airways,12/06/14,My daughter tried to fly from NYC to DFW. Jet Blue has canceled one flight and delayed her two times and given 3 different excuses. All other airlines are on time or less than 30 minutes delayed. Thanks for a miserable experience JetBlue. Estimated travel time from NYC to DFW 16 hours unless there is another delay!,jetblue-airways,09/06/14,Used to love JetBlue but my last trip a couple of days ago changed my perception. The plane seemed to be old and in a poor condition. Basically none of theâ€œcreature comfortsâ€ù worked. We had 2 seats. The seat back on the 1st seat was broken and would not stay in the upright position. The video screen on the 2nd seat worked but the screen itself would not stay put. The reading lights did not work on either of the seats significant on a late-night flight. The plug for the audio on the 1st seat only worked occasionally. There were plenty of open rows of seats but they all required us to pay extra so we could not be moved to those seats. Otherwise our only option was to move from an aisle and middle seat to a window and middle seat. It was a long flight (JFK to SFO) and we get up and walk around every hour or so and just did not want to impose on another (probably sleeping) passenger that frequently so declined this option. Bottom line is that while the legroom was great and the people were friendly the seats were uncomfortable and plane appeared to be old and in disrepair. Certainly not worth the extra money that we used to be willing to pay to be a passenger on a JetBlue plane rather than on a competitors plane.,3jetblue-airways,05/06/14,BOS to SAN and SEA to BOS. This is by far my favorite domestic (US based) airline and I preferentially fly them whenever I can. They really do go the extra mile to make sure your flight is pleasant - start to finish. Gate hassles are minimal compared to United and Delta and in my opinion food/beverages/entertainment are far superior to any other airline in economy class. Let's hope they don't change!,8jetblue-airways,03/06/14,1st June from LAX to JFK. Cabin crew were really unfriendly. They didn't smile at all and I was under the impression that they felt that we were a burden (the passengers). I have traveled extensively and on many airlines. I have to say this is the first time I have felt uncomfortable on a flight- even to the point that I was reluctant to ask for anything from the cabin crew.,1jetblue-airways,23/05/14,My flight was cancelled to NYC where I was supposed to have a 3 hour lay-over before catching an international flight to London. 2 hours before flight time JetBlue cancelled my flight and rebooked me on a flight the next day. I spent over 1 hour on the phone with them mainly on hold while they were supposed to figure out how I could get from Rochester NY down to JFK in time for my flight. After over an hour's wait a supervisor got back to me and said - sorry nothing we can do - flight is canceled due to weather. I asked where was the weather problem. As she was saying that there is a lot of rain in NYC I was looking at the weather.com report that reported partly sunny skies at JFK. Because of the weather excuse I cannot get compensation from my travel insurance. I have lost a day of vacation will be late for a family wedding and have had to pay a hefty fee to rebook my flight overseas. Thanks a lot Jet Blue.,1jetblue-airways,17/05/14,I have not even boarded the plane yet and am already not happy with the airline. Tavelling as a couple I tried to do an online checkin to secure seats next to each other. Online checkin not available. Please see the agent at the airport. I went to Seattle airport 10 hours before the flight to ensure that we could get adjacent seats and was assured by agent at the check in counter we were sitting next to each other. After receiving our boarding passes I noticed that we were in different rows and brought this to the agents attention. Suddenly the only way to get adjacent seats were to upgrade or check at the gate. At the gate it was the same story: Yes we can get you adjacent seats for a small fee of $80 per person. What a scam. Next time I'll try hitchhiking to New York if the only other option is Jet Blue.,1jetblue-airways,12/05/14,Great for national flights horrible for international. Their TV's do not work? Infantile movies weak service cheap chips and soda. No nice hot meals or free wine like most others that fly internationally and they have high prices you can get cheaper flights with others and check two bags free get a hot meal free drinks like wine or beer or drinks Their service is so mediocre for international flights.,jetblue-airways,11/05/14,This was my first and last time on JetBlue. I received a text stating my flight home from JFK-ORD was cancelled. No explanation. No help from JetBlue. Could not get through to them. An email said they were working on rescheduling but that was the last I heard. I suspect that the flight was empty on a Saturday night and they simply chose not to fly the plane. Cost $600+ to get home on AA where I found the flight crew so much more polished and professional than JB. I will never fly JB again.,5jetblue-airways,05/05/14,Flight from Tampa to JFK was delayed 3.5 hours made our party of 4 miss our flight to Portland ME. Flight finally got to JFK at 11pm with 1 lost bag we made it to the car rental counter with 5 min to spare to drive 400 miles home. No help from JetBlue. They did offer us a flight to Portland at 6pm the following night. Spent the entire day trying to call JFK to find missing bag 4 un-returned calls. Finally called Portland they had my bag and had no information I was looking for it. I will never fly Jet Blue again!,jetblue-airways,03/05/14,3 hour delay departing and canceled flight on the return. Staff were unprofessional and unhelpful on both legs. Many TVs were broken around us (2 of our 4 plus other people) and they could not care less. Canceled flight cost us money in the end because we got sent to a different airport and had to get a car service to our original airport to get back to our own car. They wouldn't compensate us for any of all these problems. This was Newark to Orlando and back and I see that those JetBlue flights are notoriously delayed and/or canceled.,jetblue-airways,28/04/14,It seems as though their customer service and on-time flight performance has gone down tremendously. My sister and I purchased two one-way tickets from San Juan PR to JFK. We were told by the personnel at the gate that our flight was being delayed approximately 4 hrs due to a plane in New York with mechanical problems. Simultaneously we began receiving emails from the jetblue website telling us the delayed flight would depart at an earlier time. The Gate personnel had no knowledge of this. Bottom line is: customers pay hefty fares for some flights particularly on weekends and we do expect these planes to leave on time. We got to New York so late we missed our concert.,jetblue-airways,16/04/14,Round-trip from Richmond VA to Ft. Lauderdale FL. Could not have been happier. Plane took of on time both trips and arrived ahead of destination time. The seats the snacks the flight attendants all good. I thought they actually appreciated my business! Also the $70.00 each way my husband and I saved on the bags was a real bonus! First trip the Pilot actually came out of his cabin and talked to us before takeoff.,10jetblue-airways,15/04/14,This was my very first flight taken for a business matter. Without knowing what to expect being so inexperienced I prepared for the worst. Thinking this would be a delayed or cancelled flight resulting in a late arrival. I experienced a small delay before take off yet arrived at JFK on time. The flight attendants were polite and went out of their way to accommodate passengers. The flight crew kept passengers up to date on weather and arrival times. All equipment functioned properly and my luggage was promptly returned. JetBlue Airlines is certainly worth the money.,9jetblue-airways,03/04/14,"I've been flying back and forth with JetBlue for the past 6 years. I fly once every other month. At first I was so satisfied with the service that I have never flown with any other airline. But lately the past year especially the service has gone downhill. The staff used to be so friendly and always smiling. My last Flight was in December my TV was not working when I informed the flight attendant I got nothing but attitude and her answer was ""I don't know what to tell you."" After six years of using them that was my last and final time.",3jetblue-airways,31/03/14,Impressed by the customer service I received when I was delayed 4 hours at Newark Airport on March 27th 2014 on Flight 505 to Ft. Lauderdale. The customer service representatives kept passengers well informed they ordered pizza for passengers gave out free water and snacks and were happy to offer assistance to passengers who wanted to change their flights. We had free inflight movies and also when we arrived at our destination we received an e-mail stating that we were given a voucher for future flights for our inconvenience caused by the delay.,10jetblue-airways,31/03/14,"Newark NJ to Ft Lauderdale FL on the way to Costa Rica March 30th. Transfer flight was cancelled after a few delays. Instead of rushing to find people ways of getting to their destination staff promptly resorted to ""save face"" mode claiming it was not the fault of the airline. On top of that false claim they refused to help reschedule a flight if it involved a different airline. Therefore our party of 3 will have to pay extra to get a decent company to help us reach our destination. Last time I deal with this airline.",1jetblue-airways,06/03/14,I have always flown JetBlue and have had only positive experiences with them. Their flights are always on time. The seats are comfortable and clean. The TV is free. The bag check is free. The snacks are free. When my TV didn't work they gave me free cocktails for the rest of the plane ride to keep me entertained. I've used them flying mostly from JFK to LA and from JFK to Florida and have never had an issue so I'm sure that those with negative experiences unfortunately were just dealing with flukes!,10jetblue-airways,27/02/14,I flew with JetBlue for the first time when I missed my original flight in JFK and I was checked in for their JFK-Phoenix service. They have nice and new planes with more leg room. My ticket was originally with British Airways and they did a great co-operation with British Airways with booking me for the last minute flights and sending my untagged baggage all the way from Italy to Phoenix. Plus they have very friendly staff I'm very satisfied.,10jetblue-airways,17/02/14,Booked a flight from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. The flight as first was delayed 2 hrs due to maintenance issues. After 2hrs we were then told it was cancelled. Couldn't get another flight until the next day. I purchased tickets that same night with a different airline. Extremely inconvenient! Never will I fly jetBlue again!,jetblue-airways,10/02/14,Booked a flight with Jetblue for 12/30/13. Arrived at the airport and was told the flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue and they couldn't get me out until 2 days later. They had no reciprocal agreement except with American Airlines which did not fly to my destination. The staff were not very helpful and to top it off my return flight was delayed 6 hours. Not a pleasant experience.,jetblue-airways,07/02/14,I booked a flight 1/4/14 to Orlando from Hartford. I was willing to pay a premium to include extra leg room due to a non-stop flight option and pay $600. My flight was 7pm out of Hartford and expected to arrive in Orlando at 10pm. A snow storm is approaching later tonight 6-8hrs after take-off. It's now 10pm stars are in the sky and I should have already been in Orlando. I was told that the direct flight was cancelled at 6pm as I arrived at the JetBlue desk. I received no email or text message. I asked Jet Blue for other alternative options and they could not even come close to accommodate until next day? Very premature to cancel a non-stop flight. They have lost a customer. As a result I had to cancel my trip and drove home.,jetblue-airways,05/02/14,Our flight from JFK to St. Lucia on 7th January was cancelled without informing us. The weather was no excuse as the 6th had been a warm day in New York. The airline did not inform us of this cancellation and we only found of it upon attempting to check-in online. We ended up cancelling and flying Caribbean Airlines which took off on time two hours before the JetBlue flight would have taken off.,jetblue-airways,23/01/14,I flew out of Hartford on December 10th. I told the flight attendant my TV was not working and my daughters audio was not working. There were other passengers on that flight having the same problem. They had to reset the system but it didn't help. The seats available to move to were not offered because they were extra room seats. It made for a long trip. It's just sad you pay so much money for this flight and you don't get full service.,5jetblue-airways,20/01/14,"My flight like the flights of thousands of others was cancelled when JetBlue grounded all aircraft from NYC and Boston on 6th January. Fine I can understand and accept that extraordinary measures must be taken in extraordinary times. The real shock unfurled when I was to encounter the 'customer service' team at JFK airport (and I use this term very lightly). After queuing for 4 hours we were all greeted by unhelpful and at some points outwardly aggressive staff. My fellow passenger was told that he could not be re-booked for 3 days. When he pointed this out the 'customer service' agent's reply was ""very good I can see you can count - not my problem"". I was grounded for 4 days and was only informed of the option of a hotel when I did some detective work with fellow passengers. As I was flying due to a death in the family I ended-up taking a 13 hour bus trip to Toronto where WestJet went out of their way to accommodate me. In the end JetBlue's attempt at compensation was a $50 credit to fly on one of their flights in the future.",jetblue-airways,10/01/14,Flight 449 from Boston Logan airport to Orlando scheduled to depart on Jan 6 at 11.30. My first (and last) experiece with JetBlue was horrendous. This airline managed to cause us 7+ hours of delay with no explanation or compensation. We were pushed from gate to gate three times then when we finally got a plane we had no crew then no pilot! Then there were maitenance issues. The part that baffles me is that there was no reason for the initial delay! In theory when you book a flight there is supposed to be a plane available as well as a crew and pilot. I have no idea how this was cause for delay aside from total imcompetance which was made up for by nothing except an announcement that there would be no running water on the flight. In the future I will do myself a service by booking elsewhere even at the expence of a few extra dollars.,jetblue-airways,09/01/14,FLL-JFK on Jan 6th 2014. Flight scheduled at 7.13 am arrived as FLL Jetblue Terminal at 6am as we had luggage to check-in. The terminal was packed but check-in worked fine. At 7am we were informed by the display at the gate that the flight was delayed 1 hour therefore departing at 8.13am. At 8.30am still no news and no aircraft. At 9am our aircraft shows up at the gate and the announcement said that in a matter of few minutes time to clean up the aircraft boarding would have started. At 9.30 informed that there's no captain to fly the aircraft. At 10.30 a captain shows up. Boarding in 15 minutes is announced once again. At 11am our captain walks out of the aircraft. At 11.30 announcement says that a new captain was on his way. At 11.45 the newly found captain shows up. At 12.00 boarding actually starts and we finally took off at 12.30 with 5 hours + 17 minutes delay. During the flight the pilot explained that jetblue had a major operation challenges that morning.,1jetblue-airways,08/01/14,Terrible experience on Sunday January 5 2014 at JFK. They cancelled the flight on which we were booked a little over an hour before take off. There was chaos in the airport due to the number of flights JetBlue cancelled at once and its unwillingness to assist the customers to find replacement flights. They kept announcing over the loud speakers that they had no replacement availability for several days and that customers should not even try to rebook with JetBlue's airport personnel. That is extremely inconvenient once one is at the airport with luggage. We ended up buying new tickets on a JetBlue flight 6 hrs later but that flight after being delayed 3 or 4 times was also cancelled - due to there not being a pilot or co-pilot available! That was 6 hrs after the scheduled departure time! We found a JetBlue flight that had a few unoccupied seats and a sympathetic agent got clearance to allow us to swap our second ticket for that flight. That one agent was the only helpful person we encountered at Jet Blue. We still do not have our luggage which was set ticketed for the cancelled flight. There was no time to retrieve it and still board the alternative flight we identified.,jetblue-airways,08/01/14,We flew on January 5th had to connect through Boston which was effected by the winter storm. Our flight was supposed to leave at 6am but after an hour JetBlue said that it was still trying to locate one flight attendant. After only minimal updates at 11am they were able to take off however JetBlue never provided any information on how it would handle connecting flights. When you asked you received a different answer each time from a different airport personnel. When the flight landed at Boston there were no personnel to assist those that missed connections there was no communication from the flight deck on missed connections and each counter agent in Boston was dismissive. Very disorganized not helpful a free-for-all environment left it up to you to find your way home.,jetblue-airways,29/12/13,JFK-FLL-JFK. The flight was extremely inexpensive. Flight left 20 minutes late but landed on time. Even More Space Seat was worth the cost to avoid the TSA line at JFK alone but the room onboard was great. The flight was smooth but the audio jack was overused and my headset plug was constantly falling out if I moved the wrong way. Return flight was not as smooth the gate changed 6 times at FLL and was very confusing. IFE was not working at my seat but was given a $15 voucher for future flight although it expires within the year. Flight was also moderately turbulent with no feedback from the flight crew. Flight back was not in Even More Space but was still roomy enough for a big guy like me. JetBlue isn't perfect but much better than most that fly out of the area.,7jetblue-airways,19/12/13,My flight was on 12/17/2013 from Boston to Seattle (1 connection in Philly with Alaska Airlines). Delayed 2-3 hours from original departure time which is around 3pm. Around 4.23 they told us to get onboard but kept us inside for 2 hours until we finally took off. Because of this we missed our connection from PHIL to SEA and I am stuck in PHIL. Called JetBlue and asked them to accommodate us with another flight from PHIL to SEA today and they wont do it. Asked them to at least pay for the lodging tonight because we stuck in PHIL and they wont do it. On a brighter note Alaska are willing to put us in a flight back today for free!,jetblue-airways,17/12/13,If you're traveling with children don't pick this airline. We flew 5.5 hours to New York and not one not two but all three of the TVs provided for our kids didn't work. You can imagine our flight experience. What was Jet Blue willing to do for this? A $15 credit only if we fly on Jet Blue again and only if we pay for another flight with them within the next year! So for our inconvenience we get to book and pay for another flight with them! Oh and they refused to allow the credit to be used on the flight for the trip home!,3jetblue-airways,17/12/13,My flight check-ins were seamless. I have never flown on an airline with so much legroom for the standard coach or 3rd class! Clean and comfy seats nice variety of channels. Wish they had complementary meals for the flights that are 5+ hrs long. Flew from BUF-SFO everything went smoothly on time departures. Flights from SFO-BOS BOS- JFK and JFK-BUF were delayed and they apologized for that. Customer service in BOS was good but customer service in JFK wasn't good at all. Either way I'd still recommend this airline to family and friends.,8jetblue-airways,06/12/13,PBI-HPN then HPN-PBI. Best flight by far of my jetblue experience every flight took off on time and smooth flights all the way. The Big Plus - great leg room TV's at every seat and good seat recline! Will definitely fly again.,10jetblue-airways,02/12/13,Polite helpful staff. Never a rushed response. Excellent DFW staff and crew on flight to BOS. I need wheelchair assistance it was available each time without delay.,10jetblue-airways,02/12/13,Flight from SJU to DCA on Dec 1 was delayed 2.5 hours without explanation or apology. Conflicting flight information on departure boards and unhelpful announcements from ground staff.,3jetblue-airways,28/11/13,"Return. JFK-LIR. 11/9: JFK-LIR: #1691. 11/16: LIR-JFK: #1692. Both going and coming back the JetBlue experience was what you would expect for a low cost airline these days. On time departure. Good communications from the flight deck. Flight attendants were in the cabin offering ""snack boxes"" and beverages. Friendly and accessible. > Bottled water offered at the end of the flight was a nice touch.",10jetblue-airways,18/11/13,Orlando for business - trip generally fine - my complaint specifically regards handling of baggage policies and staff lack of freedom to solve lost baggage problems - checked 1 piece of luggage 28 minutes before the flight 2 mins too late - it was not loaded on my flight - didn't find out until arrival and going to baggage service - told it would be on next flight 1 am - but JetBlue staff hands are tied. Customer has to return to the Airport to pick up their luggage or make arrangements on their own to have it shipped - JetBlue baggage service called 7am to tell me to pick up my luggage - finally agreed to send with 3rd party service for cash fee $30 - It arrived after 4 pm so I attended my business meetings in dirty travel clothing - JetBlue has got to figure out a better way - I would rather pay upfront for luggage service than get free and no respect.,4jetblue-airways,15/11/13,Overall the flight was fine. However I noticed that the people that pay Even More Space and get to sit on an Exit Row will be seated with people that did not pay. So do not buy Even More Space just go to airport and volunteer to go to Exit Row (Even More Space) and it will be Free.,9jetblue-airways,14/11/13,JFK to LAX very good flight first time flying with Jet Blue very nice flight. Leg room is good and crew were professional offering prompt service and the captain explaining weather and how long he expected turbulence to last etc. The only negative on the flight was being a vegetarian there was only the quinoa salad available for a meal and by the time they got to our row (16) they had run out as there were apparently only 7 or 8 salads. They handled it very well were really polite and gave me a snack box free of charge but I think I should be able to order a proper meal on a 6 hour flight. The return flight was not as good staff were a bit indifferent we were delayed 1.5 hours with no explanation or apology and it took 40 mins for the first bag to arrive in the baggage claim area. Would fly with them again.,8jetblue-airways,12/11/13,BOS - LAX A320. Full flight but boarding was made efficient and completed rather quickly. Seats and entertainment were really showing there age with any bumps the screen flickered and the window seat in my row cut out a couple times for that person. Also the audio was not working well which was caused by headphones with a microphone (apple iPhone headphones). However when I mentioned the issue the attendant kindly gave me a jetblue set which worked fine. Flight was good with snacks and drinks.,10jetblue-airways,29/10/13,Flew JFK-HOU-JFK for supposedly a budget airline the seats were better than some business class seats on European airlines. Flights left on time and the service was very good. Price of ticket was less than the other U.S. airlines and as someone used to budget airlines in Europe it was a nice change not to have to pay to check baggage in.,10jetblue-airways,22/10/13,Flew Jetblue 8th October JFK-SJC. Flight left and arrived on time friendly crew. Highlight was the free check in luggage and snacks which you would not find on other domestic flights. I would definitely fly Jetblue domestically.,9jetblue-airways,20/10/13,First time flying with them and loved every minute of it! Staff were excellent and so attentive! Short flight to JFK from Buffalo and back but what a great experience! Counter staff was a pleasure to deal with - very accommodating and helpful! Flight crews were excellent. This is very short flight but they really get moving to make sure everyone is helped and fed in a short time frame!,10jetblue-airways,09/10/13,"I flew JetBlue 26 times in a 3 month time span going from DCA to BOS. It is a great airline and a pleasure to fly. The best is the legroom the nice flight attendants and the in flight entertainment. On about 1/4th of my trips had heavy delays but that's because of weather and was unavoidable. I had only one really bad flight that was delayed for about 4 hours but that was the worst of it. There are no ""middle seats"" as the configuration is 2 and 2 and there are no carts - the flight attendants use baskets of chips and put the soft drinks in the pockets of their apron. I like that. Then there is the in-flight entertainment which makes the flight seem a lot shorter and pleasant. I notice that the fares are usually competitive with American or Delta (or in some cases a little more) but its worth it in my opinion.",10jetblue-airways,03/10/13,We traveled between July and September 2013. My friend travels with a portable kidney machine. I notified them of this fact when I made the reservation by computer. I was told he could bring the machine and another medical bag for free. When it was time to board the plane they took everybody  except the disabled persons first including children in strollers. I think a person with a kidney machine should trump a child with a stroller for boarding. When we got onto the plane I asked one on the flight attendants where we could store this somewhat heavy kidney machine. She promptly told us there was no room to store it other than the overhead bin. I told her I couldn't lift this machine over my head. Another flight attendant and the disabled person lifted it into the overhead. On the return trip we just decided to check it in. The woman at the check-in desk was very accommodating.,7jetblue-airways,29/09/13,I took JetBlue twice within the last 10 days. The first from Chicago to Boston the plane left more than an hour late than scheduled due to machinery problems and midway during the flight it was revealed to us that we were landing in Buffalo NY because the problems apparently had not been fixed. I ended up getting home more than 5 hours later than scheduled that night. I was issued a travel bank credit so I used this to take another JetBlue flight from LA to Boston a few days later thinking that the same thing probably cannot happen again. Apparently I was wrong. The flight was late again for another hour due to machinery problems. While we were waiting on the tarmac I asked my husband to ask for a blanket as it felt a bit cold and the flight attendant wanted to charge us $5 for the blanket. I can't help but think that: you've wasted a total of 5-10 hours of our time in the past few days and you're asking us for $5? This is the last time I will take JetBlue unless they are significantly cheaper or have a much more convenient time than other options (Which I don't think they do).,2jetblue-airways,25/09/13,Very disappointed with the 5-6 hrs delay of arrival in Puerto Rico from LAX on 9/14/13. We flew in a day early of our embarkation for our 7 days Caribbean cruise and had our travel agent book us at the Sheraton San Juan so we could tour the place on the day of arrival on 9/14/13. Our flight was delayed due to radio problems after we left JFK on a connecting flight to San Juan. We got diverted to Orlando Fla for refuelling and to have the problem fixed but heard that the radio problem was not fixed. The plans we made were spoiled by this. We arrived at the hotel quite late in afternoon. Due to embarkation for our cruise the next day (9/15) it gave us limited time to do the activities we wanted. It's our very 1st Jet blue flight and I'm really very disappointed.,jetblue-airways,22/09/13,"Flight 264 SEA-JFK. Delayed 1 hour and Flight 263 JFK-SEA. On time. Fast efficient check in. Friendly staff. Excellent onboard service. Legroom was fantastic. Flight attendants are funny and professional at the same time. Free Snacks are great and they keep giving you more. They give a whole can of pop and a small bottled water unlimited. Inflight entertainment is wonderful. Direct TV/SIRIUS Music and some select movies for pay (not on demand though). They give complimentary ""Snooze kit"" on a red eye flight which consists of earplugs and eye shades. Hot towel service is an added bonus. They are better than the legacy carriers with only Virgin America as their closest competitor in terms of service and onboard comfort.",10jetblue-airways,16/09/13,September 15 2013 my husband and I flew from Aruba to Boston and we had the best flight. We were on Flt #774 it was wonderful the captain was very pleasant and the flight attendants could not be more accommodating and entertaining.,10jetblue-airways,13/09/13,"JFK-CLT. I've flown them often and the only complaint I can muster is their occasional delays. The attendants were friendly as usual. The free inflight Live DirectTV and Radio is better than most international airlines and I believe 36 in of legroom come standard (though I may be wrong). Free (""unlimited"") snacks and beverages are a nice addition considering it's only a 2 hour flight. Their custom built Terminal 5 at JFK is excellent - fast WiFi tons of power ports and lots of space and shops. It makes the occasional delay quite bearable. Leather seats are great and you can even purchase ""Even More Legroom"" which being quite short I've never needed to but the purchase also let's you use first class check in and security lines along with priority boarding. The free checked bag is amazingly useful especially if you're connecting flight is international. It's worth pointing out that you need to bring your own headphones or you'll have to purchase one for a dollar or two. They are reusable though.",10jetblue-airways,12/09/13,"BOS-PHL flight was cancelled 90 minutes before it was scheduled to take off. The only reason given was ""weather"". However the later flight from BOS-PHL was on time and other airlines were flying to PHL. Instructed to get in the very long full service line. While waiting in line received an email saying we were confirmed on the next available flight to PHL which happened to be the next day in the AM. I suggested booking us on a different airline to PHL their response was ""we can't do that"". There was no attempt to accommodate us in any way. While other airlines get you on another flight or at least get you a hotel room when a flight is cancelled Jet Blue just shrugs their shoulders. I absolutely won't fly them again.",jetblue-airways,02/09/13,Took a short trip from IAD to JFK. Good seats spacious legroom good entertainment including a small snack and a drink for a short flight. Courteous staff. In the future jetBlue will always be the first choice for domestic travel in the US. The jetBlue terminal at JFK was nicely done.,10jetblue-airways,20/08/13,Vegas to Long Beach August 12th. On a recent trip we traveled 3 airlines: Frontier United express and Jet Blue. Jet Blue was by far the best airline. Reasonable fare clean airplane plenty of leg room courteous staff. Will continue to be my first choice airline.,10jetblue-airways,15/08/13,Constant delays and very poor communication from the staff. Never flying JetBlue again. Flew from SJU-JFK and JFK- SJU. Both flights were delayed even with good weather. Will be going back to the legacy carriers which deliver people on time.,jetblue-airways,13/08/13,The one thing I can say that I liked about this airline was the cheap flight. Unfortunately that is the only positive part of my entire flight from Boston to Phoenix. The seats were so uncomfortable and the flight attendants were rude. When I asked if the movie would start over if I bought a head seat she looked at me like I was stupid and said no. The other flight attendant that was with her glared at me and looked at my seat number like I was going to cause problems for them when my friend asked what was the point of handing out the headsets after the movie already started. I haven't been on a flight in quite some time but I remember it being a pleasant time when customers were treated with respect. I felt like I was an inconvenience to this airline and I will never fly with JetBlue again.,1jetblue-airways,12/08/13,9th August Flight 2579 Boston to Newark 3.44 departure. Delayed due to weather and finally mechanical problems in cockpit. Left eventually at 8.37 arriving Newark 21.27. Missed my transatlantic connection. Stranded at airport overnight. JetBlue rep stated it wasn't his problem and he was going home despite my polite requests. Result was they paid for my overnight hotel grudgingly. Never flying with them again.,1jetblue-airways,12/08/13,"I have been a frequent flyer on JetBlue and lately I have been thoroughly displeased with them. I haven't been on a flight of theirs that actually took off at its scheduled departure in the past year or so. There are constant delays with the excuse that it's due to ""weather"" issues when I know there are no bad weather patterns from where I am to where I'm going. They use it as an excuse so that they don't have to pay the customers any money for retribution. Then once on my flight they are in a hurry to only offer the limited free menu items. We are not offered any drinks or complimentary snacks besides peanuts and soda. Flight attendants are also in a rush for people to get off their cell phones and become rude. This past flight they did just that and then we continued to sit on the runway for an additional half an hour during which time I used my cell phone because we weren't going anywhere. I do not recommend JetBlue despite their reasonable prices.",1jetblue-airways,05/08/13,"Flight 994 from Denver to Boston on August 4th 2013. Flight left late because of ""computer troubles"". However this was not the problem. Upon confirmation that we were close to landing I apparently turned on my phone too soon before being ""approved"" to do so. Stewardess promptly came over and in a very condescending tone berated me for using my phone. Upon explaining to her that I had it on airplane mode and that it posed no threat to the in-flight navigation system she offered another sarcastic response. After the continued verbal confrontation I was left wondering if there was a way she could have gone about this without embarrassing myself and my family.",3jetblue-airways,30/07/13,JFK to ORD. Flight was full and staff at the gate were irritated and unhelpful. Seated in 21B and my wife seated in 13F. Tried to get seat next to each other gate staff refused. They were also unorganized. We were on time at the Airport but they delayed the flight 20 minutes and then they started boarding. Boarding was fine but no help. Ground staff at the gate very rude booking staff helpful but Inflight staff not helpful at all. Flight taxied for about an hour before departing JFK. They definitely need competent staff and need training in Customer Service.,jetblue-airways,29/07/13,Flying Portland to Long beach flight was supposed to board an hour and thirteen minutes ago. No indication of when we will leave. Reading reviews online and realizing this is a common occurrence with this airline. This is my first try at saving a few dollars by flying JetBlue. I'd be hard pressed to fly with them again given this experience and their poor track record (at least as reported by online reviewers). For the good of all JetBlue should charge more fix their planes and their processes.,1jetblue-airways,24/07/13,After traveling for over 24 hours from Asia the final flight from JFK to Portland Maine was delayed and then canceled with no chance of me getting on a flight early the next day - resulting in about 18 hours of additional waiting. So I took the bus instead which was just as fast and more dependable.,jetblue-airways,24/07/13,Outbound flight 687 from BOS on 7/22/2013 scheduled for 7.24pm actually departed around 10.15pm. It took over 2 hours to accomplish that task and we arrived at LAX around 4am PDT. Flight became a red-eye.,3jetblue-airways,11/07/13,Outgoing flight: Boston MA (Logan) to Baltimore MD (BWI) on 7/3/13. Flight #1427. Return flight: Baltimore to Boston on 7/10/13. Flight #1526. Terrible. Constant delays (2-3 hours per flight) for absolutely no reason. No updates either. In-flight entertainment flickers on and off every few minutes also for no reason.,jetblue-airways,07/07/13,Orlando to NYC flight delayed 4 hours. Flight scheduled for 7.30 pm at night and was delayed to 11.55 pm. When the plane was in the air my wife asked to be seated in the more legroom seat she could sleep more comfortably and the request was denied. They explained the seat was more money than my wife had purchased. They did not care that the seat was not being used.,jetblue-airways,07/07/13,Flights between Portland and Anaheim were a huge disappointment in terms of flight delays. We saw the airplane arrive but our flight kept being delayed without giving us a reason. We understand that there are some issues going on but as customers we would like to be recognized for our waiting at the airport. The good sides: The flight seats were okay. The drinks and snacks were pretty nice. But I have had better experiences on other flights.,6jetblue-airways,04/07/13,Flight 2402 from JFK to Buffalo on July 2 2013 was delayed 6 times. Felt sorry for the staff member working the gate as many passengers were complaining to her. Should have been a top official from JetBlue fielding the complaints. My wife and I had just got off a 10+ hour flight from Istanbul to New York and JetBlue was our connecting flight to Buffalo. All we wanted to do is get home. Six delays and no JetBlue higher up there to explain why there were delays. If I never fly JetBlue again.,3jetblue-airways,01/07/13,From Boston into Philadelphia. Flight down delayed 3 times due to what was reported as bad weather in Philadelphia. Waiting around in the airport for that long was exhausting. I found out the last delay was that the crew had timed out during the time of the delays. On the flight back from Philadelphia to Boston the flight was delayed only once. Overall the flight was pleasant and the crew friendly. When I have a lot of free time on my hands won't mind flying with this airline again.,5jetblue-airways,01/07/13,BDA-JFK-SFO-LGB-LAS-SJU-STT I had a few flights with this airline in the USA past month I can tell I am very satisfied with their services and price! Planes new staff friendly flights on time good seat pitch snacks on board free of charge first bag flies free on board TV show very good! I would recommend.,10jetblue-airways,09/06/13,Flew JFK-SXM return. Issue on outbound with an engine sensor meant a rejected take off and return to gate. Whole process was handled really well and dealt with very quickly. Lost of communication. On board service was good with friendly crews on both legs of the trip.,10jetblue-airways,06/06/13,PDX to Long Beach 18th-24th April 2013. Not paying for baggage extremely comfortable seats (with more standard cabin leg-room than I've had in years free snacks and beverages and friendly staff. JetBlue reminded me of what flying was like 20 years ago when most of those amenities were still part of flying but have subsequently gone out of style.,10jetblue-airways,27/05/13,We flew to Logan from BWI and back. The first flight took off early. It is a short flight - absolutely no issues. Very good seat room in standard coach on a 100 seat regional jet.,10jetblue-airways,23/05/13,Our flight from PBI to LGA was diverted to JFK. Upon landing they stated that a bus will be provided for transfer to LGA. After waiting more than an hour no bus at all. Pay my own transfer don't provide service if you are not prepared to provide it.,5jetblue-airways,20/05/13,Excellent starting with the telephone customer service representative who set up our seating and arranged for an aisle chair. This is one of the only times we arrived at the airport and the aisle chair was waiting instead of having to remind an employee to get it after prior arrangements were made. This is the first trip that I did not come home with mysterious bruises from being bumped around getting on and off the plane. Bad weather resulted in the plane being directed to Orlando instead of Ft Lauderdale. The staff arranged to help me off the plane even suggested I leave due to the projected wait time even though it was more work for them. The were pleasant and friendly even though they must have been very tired and stressed by the delays.,10jetblue-airways,20/05/13,I have taken 4 flights with jetBlue during 2nd week of May. My experience was very pleasant from the time of checking in. I had 2 pieces of luggage and everything was done very swiftly and efficiently. The leg space is very comfortable which is much more than most of the airlines I travelled. Flights are neat and the cabin crew were courteous and efficient. Inflight service of complimentary drinks and snacks were served to every one enthusiastically. The in house entertainment was great with many channels to view. The entertainment is no way less than many international flights. The luggage came very fast at the carrousels for all the flights that I took. I had a very pleasant experience in all the flights. I will be happy if they can waive the $100/ penalty for the change of flights.,10jetblue-airways,19/05/13,Flew FLL to DCA and return with Jet Blue. Both flights arrived early clean aircraft friendly cabin crew and no charge for first bag plus a very reasonable ticket cost. I find Jet Blue provide good fares with good service you cannot beat that.,10jetblue-airways,13/05/13,JFK to FLL on May 8th. Once again completely satisfied with the service. I hope they will expand to more destinations in Latin America and Europe.,10jetblue-airways,10/05/13,As a Premier member on United - I tried JetBlue this morning - draining. Extremely long lines at security to begin - more importantly I was not assigned a seat until I got to the gate and the agent gave me the last row - no option was available unless I wanted to pay extra which I refused. I should have just paid more and stayed with United.,3jetblue-airways,10/05/13,Jet Blue is the largest carrier out of my home airport Boston. Consequently I end up flying them quite a lot. So far in 2013 I have not had a single on time departure. When one gets delayed over an hour in each direction on a day trip to Washington DC its difficult to have positive feelings. I am not wowed that they pass out free snacks since there is not one healthy choice in the basket I just want to get where I am going. To me Jet Blue is Jet Late.,1jetblue-airways,05/05/13,Our first (and only) flight with JetBlue. Red-eye from Denver to Boston connecting flight mysteriously doesn't arrive from NYC to get us home to DCA. No explanation just no plane. Delayed until 8.30 am then 10.30 then 11.30 and then delayed until 12.20. Four delays no explanations. Apparently JetBlue has a reputation for doing this. Never again.,jetblue-airways,16/04/13,Washington National to Boston. Great flight great service great plane. Modern wide leather seats plenty of legroom for someone 6'1 and live TV with over 35 channels. Also no fee to check bags like some other airlines. Complementary drinks and snacks onboard.,10jetblue-airways,22/03/13,I just got back from the Port Charlotte FL area using the Sarasota airport. I had non-stop flights both ways and enjoyed the trip. I was impressed with the process of ordering drinks whereby the Flight Crew came around and wrote down orders. I found this very efficient rather than blocking the aisle with a cart. Also they provided you with a full can of soda vs. other airlines that ration you by pouring 2 glasses out of a can. The snacks were also enjoyable as you were able to choose your preference. The free TV was a plus too.,10jetblue-airways,21/03/13,Flew from Boston to Punta Cana round-trip. Great experience except for the food selection. The entertainment was great lots of choices and the plane arrived in Punta Cana ahead of schedule! Staff pretty friendly and plenty of leg room. All in all not a bad experience the overall interior could use an upgrade though!,9jetblue-airways,12/03/13,Last 4 flights delayed significantly. 3 family members are currently on a 5 hour delay from Orlando to Syracuse. 2 other flights recently were delayed with mechanical issues. 4th was a weather delay. The mechanical issues are becoming more frequent which is both disturbing and frustrating. Getting fed up with air travel after 45 years of flying.,5jetblue-airways,04/03/13,Flight from JFK-MBJ round-trip with family. Nice experience. Very good legroom comfortable seats and the best entertainment I've seen - they offered live TV. Flights landed ahead schedule both on outbound and inbound (45 min ahead schedule inbound). Free sodas and snacks. Only thing I can complain over is the food you can buy onboard for me as a European they were strange meals I would like to buy a sandwich or something similar. Will fly them again.,10jetblue-airways,26/02/13,CLT-JFK-BUF. The first leg of the flight was excellent on time with excellent flight attendants on an E190. On the second leg also on an E190 my PTV wasn't working which did upset me although it was only a 1 hour flight service was still great.,8jetblue-airways,06/02/13,Recently flew from Boston to Seattle. Reasonable fare and very pleasant flight. I fly frequently and find JetBlue to have the best customer service.,10jetblue-airways,04/02/13,Very disappointed. I paid over $300 for 2 seats for a round trip to Massachusetts (an hours flight). I booked the flight 2 weeks prior to my departure date. In order to sit next to my 13 year old daughter I had to pay $30 extra just to have 'leg room' and be seated next to one another. Planes are supposed to be ergonomically designed to carry passengers. Passengers have legs. Why do you deem it necessary to charge extra for appropriate leg space? Why not offer better food items and charge for that? That is something people might want to pay for but can do with out if necessary esp on a short flight. Proper leg room and sitting beside your own children should be a priority on your airline and not one that you must pay extra fees for.,4jetblue-airways,17/01/13,On January 7 my wife myself and our 1-year old son were flying from Fort Myers to Boston on 4.35 pm flight #462. Flight was delayed twice. By that time we were all exhausted. Our new estimated time of arrival to Boston would be around 1 am so we decided to reschedule our flight to the next morning. Nobody from Jet Blue offered any kind of compensation or help with a hotel. Next morning the flight was delayed once again! Maintenance problems were cited again as a reason. It is very sad to see how badly maintained this airline has become and that we will have to choose another carrier next time.,jetblue-airways,16/01/13,My sister daughter and I travelled from New York to San Diego on January 11. We originated our travel with Aer Lingus in Dublin that morning. Very impressed with Terminal 5 in JFK and our check-in was without difficulty. Unfortunately our flight to San Diego was delayed a short time but we had worse news to come when we had boarded and were ready to leave. Told we would have to change planes and were taken off to a different gate. In all we were delayed by approx 2 hours. Once we actually took off our flight was made very comfortable and enjoyable by the cabin crew. Despite being in the back row of seats next to the toilets we were impressed by our leg room. I would use this airline again.,9jetblue-airways,14/01/13,Las Vegas to JFK JFK to Buffalo (travelling with 2 young children) - Sep 29 1.54pm flight no 194. Flight delayed due to tech problem and cancelled for the same reason - was in the short queue for 3 to 4 hrs (very inefficient staff) to make alternative arrangements. Finally got boarding pass for flight at 10.30 pm on the same day and they issued voucher for a short stay in a hotel in Las Vegas - at hotel we discovered the voucher was for a taxi not for hotel stay - returned back to Las Vegas airport - complained about it in baggage check in area and waited for 10.30 flight. Return flight from Buffalo to JFK October 1 2012. Again was a problem during check in due to incorrect rescheduling done in Las Vegas airport on 29 Sep 2012. Will never travel jetblue again.,jetblue-airways,08/01/13,LAX-JFK. Flight delayed by 2 hours. No compensation given. Once onboard the flight attendants were rather unhelpful and rude. The aircraft has shown its age as it looks old. Great IFE though.,4jetblue-airways,07/01/13,Comfortable roomy seats with plenty of legroom the seats don't recline so far as to have the person in front of you almost sitting in your lap free snacks and a beverage individual TVs for all the seats (bring your own headphones or a $2.00 charge) and even a hot towel. Helpful and friendly staff at both airline counters and onboard and excellent flights from JFK to DEN and back. Returned 20 minutes early to JFK!,10jetblue-airways,31/12/12,"Gave my seat away and bumped me to a later flight. Apparently if you select ""no preference"" as your seating option when buying your ticket you have to go to the customer service rep before boarding and have them assign you a seat. At no point in the process of purchasing the ticket or checking in and obtaining the boarding pass was I told this. When I scanned my boarding pass at the gate I was sent to the customer service counter where I discovered that they had given away the last spot on the flight already.",jetblue-airways,26/11/12,JFK to Fort Myers. Staff were helpful and friendly. Stewardesses were courteous. Inflight TVs are great. Also the first bag free check in makes sense. A great experience especially when traveling with two young children.,9jetblue-airways,13/11/12,Orlando to LaGuardia round trip. Flight left late by 15 mins but still got us to NY 20 mins ahead of original time. Service was great friendly hosts and entertainment was excellent with my own TV.,9jetblue-airways,30/10/12,IAD-JFK E190 Had an Even More ticket. I seen no evidence of Even More Speed at IAD. Ended up in the normal security line. Seat was spacious. We encountered a 2.5 hour delay due to a dent found on the aircraft. I do believe they should have let passengers disembark. However IFE was switched on and snacks distributed so they managed the situation very well. The complete product in a normal situation I think is great.,8jetblue-airways,09/09/12,JFK-CUN-JFK. To my great surprise the TV and satellite radio were actually working throughout both flights. Crew generally friendly. Both flights landed early. Sat in extra legroom seats where I suspect that many others had not paid but checked in without seats and were given the premium seats since that''s all that was available. On the return though I checked in online I was sent back to the ticket counter since an online boarding pass must still be stamped. And there is a $21 departure tax which most other airlines include in their ticket prices. But with Jetblue it must be paid at check-in.,8jetblue-airways,09/09/12,BUF-BOS-CLT and return. All four flights on an E-190. To Charlotte the planes were clean with nice FAs excellent working PTVs  on time flights and served with snacks and drinks. Back to Buffalo the first flight got delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy storms and I was afraid I was going to miss my flight in Boston. Although when I arrived the flight was supposed to have left but they kept it at the gate until I arrived 20 minutes later! PTV's weren't as good on the return flight was the only problem. Excellent airline overall.,10jetblue-airways,06/09/12,Aug 28 from Baltimore to Boston. Check-in staff friendly and helpful with getting me on their next flight after I missed mine. Flew an E-190 Regional Jet. The E-190 had more headroom and the seat was more comfortable than I expected it to be. Decent legroom. Plane very clean. DIRECTV was great. Complementary soda/juice and light snack offered. Smooth efficient boarding process. Very friendly cabin crew. All around great experience. Flight was on-time.,10jetblue-airways,05/09/12,Flew from EWR-MCO-EWR. Good Direct TV on both flights. Complimentary snacks good and you can ask for more. As a matter of fact on the return journey the FA came for a second round of snacks. Would definitely fly with them again. The only negative comments on our return flight they changed gates without notice to passengers. When we approached to one of the ground staff for this they apologized for it and said that was done because of operational reasons and they were supposed to make the announcement.,9jetblue-airways,28/08/12,I flew out of Baltimore to Seattle. I had to make a layover in Boston. Flight from Baltimore to Boston was relaxing and stress free. The free DIRECTV was a great bonus. The only con that I do have is that the seat that I was in made a very annoying sound whenever I tried to recline. Flight from Boston to Seattle was also stress free even though it was a red eye. On the long flight home I bought myself a BEEF UP box and it was good. With the free DIRECTV and a full stomach on the long flight home it was relaxing.,9jetblue-airways,20/08/12,LAS-LGB. Short flight on A320. Staff at gate very helpful. Lots of leg room. Snacks and drinks. FA's quite nice. Live TV was great.,10jetblue-airways,01/08/12,Went from BUF to TPA in February. The flight was on time (both directions). The plane was clean and had decent leg room. The kids liked the TVs and snacks. I liked that I didn't have to pay an extra $35 per checked bag like other airlines. Overall our experience was very positive and I would not hesitate to fly with JetBlue again.,8jetblue-airways,24/07/12,New York JFK to Orlando Int Florida. Airbus A320. Very friendly ground staff. Nice plane lots of legroom and seat width and comfort was great. Pilot got us through thunderstorm with minimum bumps. Took off on time and arrived on schedule despite holding for traffic close to Orlando. Great cabin crew.,10jetblue-airways,22/07/12,Booked a flight for my son from San Francisco to Boston. Red eye flight. They delayed the flight and then cancelled it all together but not until he sat in the airport for 5 hours being promised that it would take off. It was not until the crew got in and they determined that they were overtime that they cancelled the flight. They should have known their hours way before then. My feeling is that they kept them hanging on so that they did not have to book anyone with other airlines. What's worse is that I used credits from jetBlue because they did the same thing to us last year.,5jetblue-airways,22/07/12,"On July 15 2012 we were scheduled to departure from Syracuse NY to Fort Lauderdale Florida. The flight was scheduled to leave at 1.55 pm. We were inside the airplane for almost 2 hours before they asked us to get off due to ""weather"". Later on we find out that only JetBlue had cancelled all their flights to FLL Airport and we were stuck in Syracuse. There were no ""weather issues"" and it seems that JetBlue is known for using this excuse in order not to pay or credit their customers. We didn't leave on Sunday July 15th instead JetBlue said that the only available flight to make it to Florida was on Monday July 16th from Syracuse NY to Orlando Florida. On top of that they didn't provide us with any credit to spend the night or for the inconvenience of flying to Orlando instead of Fort Lauderdale.",1jetblue-airways,19/07/12,We flew Jet Blue out of Oakland. Friendly service agents and a pleasant flight. On time and luggage arrived. Individual screens for each passenger beverages and snacks on the short flight.,10jetblue-airways,09/07/12,"Scheduled to fly out of Denver on flight 98 on 07/06/12. There was a fault the airline attempted to repair it unsuccessfully and then after 4 hours plus we were officially all placed onto a replacement aircraft. That aircraft was scheduled to depart at 10.15 it left 11.00. The whole ""Jet Blue Experience"" is pretty much a joke with a $50.00 credit in lieu of the full credit we were supposed to receive for a delay over 6 hours.",1jetblue-airways,04/07/12,Flew JetBlue to Logan airport. Great flight! Crew and inflight services were top-notch better than any other US carrier. Seats seemed a little old but they were very comfortable and had PTV's. A calm and a pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again.,9jetblue-airways,03/07/12,Not family friendly. They would not let me accompany my minor child to the gate because she was older than 14. They stated that TSA made this rule but when I checked with TSA they told me that it was up to the airline and that United routinely allowed older minor children to be accompanied to the gate by a parent. I highly recommend checking the airline policies if you are in this situation.,1jetblue-airways,03/07/12,I was traveling with my family on a what was supposed to be a short flight (from San Francisco to Long beach). After everyone boarded the flight captain announced that navigation system was broken. He said it will take 15 to 20 min to fix it. After 2.5 hours problem is not fixed. We were still on the flight they didn't even let us wait at the gate. After 5 hours they provided the option to get on other flight after 5 hours. But we had to go to the ticketing counter to collect the luggage. So we missed new flight plus the old flight (which got fixed). After 6.30 hours we are still in airport. At that point I had to call it quits and buy tickets from another airline. Terrible customer service plus we don't get any compensation for the delay (refunded ticket is only compensation.,1jetblue-airways,02/07/12,First and last time I ever fly this airline. I have Diamond and Silver status on two other major carriers and will stick with them in the future. I chose this flight last minute to get home earlier. Upon arrival at Terminal 5 I noticed the majority of the flights were delayed and my flight was delayed 3 separate times. I could have looked for other options but was not provided with this option. The desk said we would be compensated for the mechanical delay. Why doesn't anyone understand the most important commodity is time and the method how this situation was handled will keep me away.,2jetblue-airways,26/06/12,JetBlue flight ex JFK to PWM. Short flight of 90 minutes duration. ER190 plane seat trims smart although only moderately comfortable for anything longer than 2 hours. Flight delayed during takeoff at JFK due to unspecified VIPs although this seemed to be more the Airport than JetBlue's issue. Communication regarding delay sporadic. On positive ledger Free bag check in meant ample space for carry on luggage and IFE combined with small snacks being brought round a big step up from more 'Famous' carriers. The best service I have yet seen from an American Airline.,8jetblue-airways,25/06/12,CUN-JFK. Flight delayed 2 hours no apologies. On board nice FA. Comfortable seating. Personal TV on every seat. Arrival at JFK was fast and easy. On a taxi just 20 min after landing.,7jetblue-airways,24/06/12,Our family waited in line for 2 hours then found out that our flight was cancelled only by asking them. Afterwards we waited in line for another 2 hours to check if we can get in another flight since we had a cruise waiting for us. After we got to the check-in counter they said they were sorry and couldn't get us another flight and that many others who were going to our cruise couldn't make it either because the airport in Florida was closed. We knew this was untrue because our other family from another city had a flight to Florida the same time we did and they were able to check in and everything. After about 30 minutes of trying to negotiate with them we decided to get a refund. Being disappointed we called in to the cruise company and told them about our situation the next day. The cruise company said that JetBlue told us to wait for them to book another flight but we went home instead. I find it completely ridiculous that they had nerves to lie to us.,2jetblue-airways,18/06/12,This was the first time traveling on JetBlue. It was awesome! We took the red eye from PDF to JFK and the first surprise was how quickly the staff got us boarded and on our way. There was no waiting for people to stow their bags. There was a quick check on cell phones and seatbelts but they were so no nonsense about it that it was refreshing! The biggest surprises were that they offer TV for all passengers and it's good TV! They offer food! And the best was the lack of the service cart! How wonderful it was to not have to compete with the cart or time your bathroom trips so as to avoid getting stuck behind the cart. The staff was extremely efficient about helping passengers without being overwhelming. Even when they had to make announcements it was quick concise and non intrusive. We will definitely fly this airline again! Great experience!,10jetblue-airways,06/06/12,My family and I flew from Newark NJ to Fort Lauderdale FL return. Checking-in and boarding the flight to FLL went very smooth - in fact smoother than my previous flight with United Airlines. Onboard the flight in both directions the seats in the standard section were comfortable and of course we had the free DirectTV service. You also had free access to certain SiriusXM stations as well. The service overall onboard was good giving us good complimentary drinks and snacks. Checking-in and boarding the flight to EWR was smooth even though there was 15-minute delay due to a deluge at the airport. The only consequence is that if you don't bring your headset you would have to pay for your own which is $2. Before they used to give them away for free but now they're charging for it.,9jetblue-airways,21/05/12,Last year my family and I took a trip to NY on Jet Blue for the first time. I was very impressed and happy with my experience. The onboard entertainment kept my children happy and busy. The flight crew was extremely friendly and glad to accommodate us. The ride was smooth and the pilot gave timely updates on the flight status and arrival to our destination. I booked a trip to the Bahamas and chose them once again.,9jetblue-airways,21/05/12,JFK-RDU: First time flying this carrier. They have a nice terminal in JFK but the security line takes a long time to get through took 40min. Staff were very friendly and kept you abreast of the flight situation even when everything was going fine. Takes a long time to taxi at JFK with all of the flights but this is not airline's fault. Seat space was excellent for both the ER190 going out and the A320 return. Didn't use the inflight entertainment as the flight was only an hour so no need to. The giving out of free snacks and drinks is nice along with the free first checked bag. I will definitely use them again.,9jetblue-airways,20/05/12,All round good airline and nice flight. The service was great from Bogota (Colombia) to Orlando. The Orlando crew were lovely. Great service. Very happy staff. Seat space was good. We were offered snacks and refreshments for free and had TV too (eat before or between connecting flights is best which I knew in advance so snacks were good). Only 3 movies to select from but lots of TV stations so it worked well for me. Service on the ground was excellent in Colombia. I was really happy with the flight price and the service and seat space.,9jetblue-airways,09/04/12,JFK-FLL roundtrip. FLL bound on E190. Spacious leg and shoulder room! Direct TV had many channels. FA's were very friendly and helpful. Return flight to JFK was totally different. FA's were unhappy and unenthusiastic. They looked tired and just wanting to get home. Older A320 still had plenty of space but not as nice as smaller E190. My rating is average of two different flight experiences.,7jetblue-airways,03/04/12,ORD-BOS-SJU return. Check-in staff and FA's really helpful. Served food and drinks (one of the few American carriers that do that). Live TV was good although you loose reception on international routes but that's ok as they give you free movies. Would recommend them over all other domestic carriers.,9jetblue-airways,22/03/12,BWI-BOS-BWI on E190 and the service could not have been better. FA's were friendly and the entertainment system fantastic. I also had plenty of legroom. The first flight was on time though the second an hour late.,10jetblue-airways,01/03/12,Round trip from Orlando to the Bahamas. Both flights were great. The crew on each flight were extremely nice and caring. The flight back delayed one hour but they were extremely apologetic and efficient. Even though the flights were short they still provided drinks and snacks. On the flight back we had a bit of turbulence but the captain kept us informed of everything. A plus is the individual TV's in every seat.,9jetblue-airways,24/02/12,Cabin crew friendly and helpful flight was 2 hours and snacks given out for free as well as drinks. TVs were nice. Flight was well priced seats were comfortable and I had plenty of legroom.,8jetblue-airways,17/02/12,"Non-stop red-eye flight A320 JFK to Las Vegas. Price was the most important thing for us when we booked. At check-in I asked for a window seat and they gave us two ""Even More"" legroom seats near the window though we paid no extra fees. Captain was friendly before departure. Helpful flight attendants but can't say they showed any extra care. Cabin was clean and comfortable. A/C was working at the max and it was really cold by the end of the flight so some people had to buy blankets for $7. Flight on time baggage ok upon arrival.",8jetblue-airways,11/02/12,NY to Ft. Lauderdale. My last minute ticket was not the inexpensive ticket I usually expect from jetBlue. Easy check-in free snacks and beverages good legroom (in a regular row) plus real-time TV. Staff were friendly and professional. Both flights on time.,9jetblue-airways,20/01/12,OAK-IAD. Best flight arrangement to the East Coast even though I had to sit next to a screaming baby on a red-eye flight. Firstly the IFE was top notch. The seats were comfortable and they gave out night-gear. Finally at less than 5 hours it was the shortest flight as well. Staff were helpful and the food decent.,9jetblue-airways,12/01/12,Roundtrip Oakland to Long Beach check in using kiosks was a breeze. The staff were professional friendly and welcoming. The inflight experience for the value of tickets is unbeatable. Inflight entertainment with free DirecTV and XM radio on each seatback. The free quality snacks and beverages delicious.,9jetblue-airways,21/12/11,JFK-BTV. JFK T5 was clean with lots of shops free WiFi and security was a breeze. It was on a newly painted A320 however the cabin was the older type. Seats were comfortable legroom was excellent and the cabin was showing its age but well maintained. Flight time was only 45 minutes but drinks were served as well as peanuts and cookies. Service was rushed the head FA was friendly but the other two were reserved. Live TV worked fine. Overall decent flight but nothing spectacular.,7jetblue-airways,11/11/11,FLL to LGA. Attendants simply don't care anymore. After years of only flying JetBlue and being more than satisfied it is time to try South West I think. We don't fly often a couple times a year so stark difference in airline service attitude etc readily apparent.,5jetblue-airways,27/10/11,Red eye flight from Long Beach to New York JFK with a connection in Salt Lake City. Aircraft was spacious clean and well maintained. Enjoyed the Direct TV and complimentary snacks. A drawback were the leather seats that made for uncomfortable seating for sleep as I kept sliding downwards but was manageable nonetheless.,8jetblue-airways,21/10/11,PDX-JFK in Economy (extra legroom). This was my first Jetblue flight - it felt like a flying bus. Somehow I was expecting a little more from this airline. Service was very efficient and rushed - I far prefer the friendliness of Southwest Airlines. I would use this airline again but it would not be a first choice.,8jetblue-airways,04/10/11,NYC-LAX. We flew with a family of 4 and were assisted at every level. Legroom is very good sure the cabin livery is bland and the seats look dated but the TV options snacks and complimentary drinks outweigh any other domestic US experience we have had.,8jetblue-airways,21/09/11,BOS-DCA-BOS. These flights were sold by Aer Lingus as part of a round-trip between Dublin and DCA. On the outward trip I received an upgrade to Extra Legroom (Row 1) on the return I was seated in Row 2 with the admonition that I would be bumped if a mobility impaired passenger needed the seat. The outbound trip was delayed due to weather conditions and I felt that more information could have been given at the gate as the departure time slipped back the return trip was early. All employees I encountered were pleasant and helpful and I was impressed a free snack/beverage was offered on these short flights.,9jetblue-airways,17/09/11,My last 3 flights with them were delayed for at least 2 hours. One trip from DCA to Boston was delayed 3 hours while we sat on the tarmac waiting for the plane to be de-iced. Every other airline was taking off and landing. Jet Blue told us that we had to wait for the de-icing truck because it wasn't being used that night by the other airlines but they had a higher safety standard. They had an inexperienced pilot and that kept us grounded for an extra 3 hours. I agree that the seats are comfortable but being held for hours to compensate for untrained staff is torture.,2jetblue-airways,15/09/11,FLL-EWR roundtrip 4-5 times each year. As jetBlue and Continental/United are the only airlines that fly direct between FLL and EWR choice is limited. I have always found the staff friendly helpful informative and quick to serve. The captain was at the front of the plane welcoming you onboard and thanking you upon arrival. The ERJ- 90s are a bit uncomfortable and narrow but the A320s are modern and clean. Always pay the $25 for extra leg room.,10jetblue-airways,15/09/11,I recently flew Boston to Tampa. The flight experience was great spacious seats professional flight crew and TV screens in all the seats made the flight more enjoyable. The only negative aspect was the price of the headsets they should be complimentary for passengers. Costs could be decreased onboard the flights snacks should be made readily available throughout the flight.,8jetblue-airways,11/09/11,Flew LGB-SEA. Flight departed slightly late but arrived in Seattle ahead of time. Crew were attentive and gave a good service. Complimentary refreshments and snacks served. A320 aircraft were clean and well kept. Overall the experience was good and I would use them again.,8jetblue-airways,10/09/11,PHX-JFK. Everything on time overnight flight. Standard JB service. Chatty flight attendants in the back made it hard to sleep. I don't feel like the seat is that great the back support is good but I think the seat bottom is thin. Arrival into JFK early.,6jetblue-airways,10/09/11,Our tickets were purchased well in advance at which time assigned seating was unavailable. We showed up at the airport to check-in and were told we could not be guaranteed our seats would be together unless we purchased the extra legroom seats which we did not want. We felt we were forced to pay the extra $40 per seat so we could sit together. We again had the same poor experience on the way home. I am extremely unhappy with this experience and feel I have been ripped off.,jetblue-airways,07/09/11,They now have their Even More Speed security lanes but it was useless. I got to walk right up and show my ID and boarding pass but it still took 30 mins to get through security. Crew was pleasant as usual but the pilot never said a word to us. Jetblue pilots usually stand in front and introduce themselves tell you the length of the flight weather etc. This one said nothing. Legroom is great and snacks are always appreciated. Yet for the second time in a row IFE didn't work. Half the channels didn't work along with several radio stations as well. I fear they are turning into just another US carrier.,5jetblue-airways,01/09/11,IAD-JFK. Booked as a codeshare flight with South African Airways. Flight was late out of IAD but that is pretty common on these East Coast morning flights. I was happily surprised with the legroom and PTV. Flight Attendants were friendly.,9jetblue-airways,16/08/11,FLL-NAS on Embraer. Short pleasant flight. Due to short flight there wasn't full drink service but everyone had bottle of water on seat when boarding. Choice of two complimentary snacks. Direct TV radios and airshow were available at any seat. Seats were comfortable with nice legroom. First bag is free on all flights. Before departure captain came out of cockpit and made welcome announcement facing cabin. Cabin crew were nice. Waiting time for baggage at NAS could be better.,9jetblue-airways,14/08/11,Unlike other airlines I don't have to worry about my bags going missing and I don't have to pay a bag check-in fee. They don't have First Class because they don't need it. They have more leg room than others and snacks and drinks. Every seat has a personal TV with free Direct TV and Radio for your entertainment.,10jetblue-airways,04/08/11,My daughter was booked on an early morning flight she got to the airport before 5am and was told her flight was canceled. My daughter repeatedly asked for help in arranging another flight and received none from Jet Blue personnel she found them unhelpful and rude and kept repeating they were sorry but there was nothing they could do. She was left to wander around a large metropolitan airport to arrange her own flight. Although I tried many attempts to resolve the problem JetBlue were very unresponsiveness and offered no real resolution.,jetblue-airways,01/08/11,We sat for 4 hrs on the tarnac on 2 different planes. On the second flight out of Dulles did not leave until 11pm and we did not arrive in Boston until 1am. We lost our connection for permission to fly which does not happen we misconnected 3 times. Service is horrible a very disorganized airline. I must say however some people were very helpful and did help accommodate us.,jetblue-airways,31/07/11,Every leg of the trip was delayed plane was very hot and we missed our connection. They wanted to charge us for rebooking after we missed our connection and were faced with a rude employee at the desk at JFK.,jetblue-airways,24/07/11,LGB-SMF return same day. Cocktails way overpriced cabin attendants slow not very friendly and one on the SMF-LGB jaunt was downright rude. A320 was OK.,4jetblue-airways,18/07/11,"JFK-FLL. Received free upgrade to ""Even More Legroom"" seat. Very spacious and wide seat with Direct TV. Drinks and free chips were served. Crews were very friendly and service was very good.",10jetblue-airways,18/07/11,BOS-IAD. A dreadful experience. The flight was delayed and no information on further delays although they were obvious (e.g. crew lining up at what was supposed to be the departure). Well worn seats. Once on the plane we could not depart for 1hr. They easily could have kept us at the gate. The satellite radio is mostly obscurities and a lot of programming for political conservatives and evangelical Christians. It struck me as a very cheap product although one has to pay for earphones if a passenger doesn't have their own. Indifferent flight attendants and unintelligible announcements The airline seems to be trading on its previous reputation for quirky friendly service.,2jetblue-airways,15/07/11,SDQ-JFK and also SJU a few times. Great coach seats in leather I love the leg room it is really comfy on international flights they always provide free movies entertainment flight attendants provides a very nice impression and a great experience. Their pilots are always saying goodbye to passengers when aircraft lands which means that they really appreciate our business with them.,10jetblue-airways,06/07/11,FLL-LGB-LAS. 2 of cabin crew called in sick so we had to wait for replacements who were very funny & in good spirits. Gate personnel kept us informed. We left about 1hr late but made up time and got to Vegas only 20 mins behind schedule. Sat in a row with extra legroom well worth the extra cost. Food was ok. TV great though some connection issues. Only annoying thing was everyone had to deplane in LGB even if continuing to Vegas on same aircraft. I actually had to move up a row! Best domestic flight on my 25000 miles trip from Dubai to USA & back.,9jetblue-airways,30/06/11,Boston's Logan International Airport-Tampa International Airport. The flight to Tampa was excellent. We sat at our original gate and we were early. There was a flight to Austin that was delayed so they moved us to a different gate where people were confused and it took some time for us to get on the plane. It was a smooth flight. The entertainment system in front of me (TV) seemed to be unattached but still worked and there are enough channels for children and adults. The cabin crew took great care of the passengers. May I say that the landing was superb!,8jetblue-airways,19/06/11,JFK-SAN/LGB-JFK The flight to San Diego was one of the best I've been on in a long time. Legroom is great free snacks first bag free lots of TV choices and satellite radio. Crew was excellent. Very enthusiastic and seemed to be enjoying their jobs so rare these days. Bag drop is way too slow as was the baggage claim. Their new meal packs for purchase are not worth the money. On the return checkin and bag drop were better. Crew was more average. The flight was full of screaming babies. Half the TV channels didn't work and the radio broke down halfway through the flight. Jetblue is always promoting the free TV and radio but they break down frequently. And as always the crew can not do anything but file a report.,7jetblue-airways,06/06/11,This review is regarding the customer service at JetBlue.com. I had a complaint about a third- party service I ordered through the jetblue web site. I made the complaint through their web submission and they followed up and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I guess I shouldn't be surprised when an airline actually has good customer service but I am.,9jetblue-airways,04/06/11,Flew Jetblue down to Tampa from JFK on Memorial Day. Great experience. Excellent leg room and seat width. Entertainment system great. Crew was great and attentive.,10jetblue-airways,26/04/11,IAD-FLL. Was pleasantly surprised by JetBlue. No bag charges on time flight drink and bag of chips included live TV and plenty of radio choice. Much better than American Airlines.,9jetblue-airways,21/04/11,I was very satisfied with our recent round trip Boston to Peurto Rico all the more so because I perceived JetBlue as a budget airline. Check in moved very quickly and flight left on time both directions. I was happy with inflight movies choice of free snacks and beverages. Lots of legroom. Attendants were pleasant and helpful.,10jetblue-airways,17/04/11,JFK-Buffalo-JFK. JetBlue Terminal 5 is new modern easily navigated and offers free Wifi. Staff polite and helpful. Outbound on A320 clean and well maintained. Legroom best I've seen in coach on any airline. Snacks and drinks offered shortly after take off by smiling and personal crew. Flight landed on time in Buffalo. Inbound on E190 this time also with smiling and personal crew. Both aircraft feature in-flight entertainment AVOD free snacks and drinks and the best cabin crew I've experienced on any US airline. A great product which I recommend!,9jetblue-airways,11/04/11,BOS to SAN poorly maintained aircraft indifferent flight attendants. My reading light did not work and at least 4 others within hearing distance did not either. Then the TV system froze for almost the whole flight - unwatchable. It was an evening flight so to pass the time I'm trying to read using the light from the illegible TV. Stuff happens but the flight attendants didn't seem to care no apology certainly nothing to make up for the problems. They just said that previous cabin crews must have not 'written them up' seemed to imply that not reporting the failures is pretty typical.,4jetblue-airways,17/03/11,MCO-BQN / SJU-MCO. Great entertainment system cabin crew friendly. Aircraft were clean seats comfortable and experience was great.,8jetblue-airways,09/02/11,Great seats. Wish we had been able to use jetBlue for our long flight to Costa Rica. But the short flight was comfortable and the staff friendly. Too bad they don't fly to all the places we go.,8jetblue-airways,02/02/11,JFK - San Juan round trip. Only completed JFK-SJU. Return flight was cancelled. I did not received the text message alert the night before the return flight. Luckily I checked the flight status the night before and found out all flights SJU-JFK were cancelled. Called the reservation desk and after 30mins wait an agent assisted me to rebook. Only could book a connecting flight that would take me home two days later. So I had to book with another carrier AA to return home. I understand the weather in NY was bad. But AA still operated without problems. JetBlue management took very extra cautious decision to cancel the operation on that day. It was a bad call.,4jetblue-airways,31/01/11,We fly several times a year from New York to Orlando and we only enjoy flying with Jetblue. From online booking to telephone customer support - it's easy and you build up your points or convert your american express points into true blue ones. Jetblue terminal in JFK is the best planes are new equipped with tv's for all passengers. The crew are nice and never refuse extra drinks or snacks during the flight. If your bag is lost Jetblue give you a voucher right away without writing a request for any reimbursement.,10jetblue-airways,31/12/10,JFK-PDX Flight Crew very helpful and kept us in the loop about delays very professional and a great choice . The Even More Legroom seats feel like First Class but don't have those large price tags attached.,10jetblue-airways,21/12/10,LAX-JFK-MCO return last week. Three flights on A320 and MCO-JKF on E190. All aircraft in good condition. At time of booking paid for extra leg room on all flights. Money well spent. Free TV channels worked flawless on all flights. Smiling and very helpful crew on all flights. jetBlue terminal in JFK clean and great to spend some time while in transit. Free WIFI throughout the terminal as in MCO. Terminal 3 in LAX is a dump and way too small for the amount of passengers handled through this terminal but T3 in LAX was the only negative aspect to a wonderful flying experience with jetBlue. The fare paid (incl fee for extra legroom) was by far the lowest available.,10jetblue-airways,24/10/10,The jet Blue experience was not good and marginally awful. Flights have always been great and on time but the True Blue program is difficult time to access and is not what I would consider a Reward program. Wrong and incomplete information leads to lost points and supervisors with no authority to make things right just ask me. Very disappointed is a kind way to say where is Customer Commitment?,jetblue-airways,13/10/10,JFK via FLL for a business trip - my only preferred airline to domestic cities. Seats had plenty of legroom. Flight attendants did a fabulous job. They sure had a lot of patience considering some of the rude passengers onboard. Service was great and ahead of schedule arrival in FLL.,10jetblue-airways,05/10/10,Boston-Fort Lauderdale. Flown with JetBlue many times and generally happy with the service. Aircraft clean well maintained and service is consistent though basic. Extra legroom seats well worth the extra money especially now they seem to get priority boarding. One gripe is the constant allowance of excessive cabin baggage which often results in late departures while stressed cabin crew offload bags that will not fit in the lockers! Twice recently on my flights it has caused confrontation during boarding and angry passengers being very rude to the crew. If only the ground staff dealt with the issue by enforcing the rules this would not happen. Apart from that snacks ok and drink service fine.,7jetblue-airways,14/09/10,Oakland to New York JFK round trip. The airline offers very good service for the price including free unlimited snacks 36 free channels of tv smiling flight attendants and good legroom. JFK connections were very efficient. The only problem is that on the way home to Oakland from JFK the flight was delayed two hours because the flight crew and their backups had been stranded due to cancellations the night before.,9jetblue-airways,06/09/10,FLL-SJU-FLL. JetBlue offers a simple yet lovely air travel experience. A320 leather seats individual IFE monitor and loads of legroom with 34inch pitch. Snacks of a good-quality and flight attendants friendly. Carry-on and first checked-bag are free. Headset is free. A low- fare airline providing a top-notch experience.,9jetblue-airways,22/08/10,BOS-JFK. The flight was delayed without any explanation. No greeting while boarding with a bored flight attendant at the door. The plane was clean. I had booked an extra space seat and I was not disappointed. The drink and snack service was ok for such a short flight and the TV was great. Overall not impressed by the attitude of the crew which is much more efficient and friendly on Virgin America.,5jetblue-airways,22/08/10,"JFK to Austin TX. I really thought the competitive advantage that Jetblue had over other airlines was the CEO vision of being a ""friendly airline"". I remember the blue chips and jokes that the crews made before take-off when Jetblue started up. That is no longer the case. An older gentleman in the front row of my flight asked for a snack while the flight attendant was taking beverage orders. She spoke to him in a very rude tone and stated that she would not serve any snacks until she was finished with the beverage service. The gentlemen had no time between flights to eat. The food was an arm length away from her but she refused. She was very rude to another woman who placed her carry on in an overhead two rows up from her seat. She made her move it one compartment over. And Jetblue what is with the manual emergency instructions - with built in televisions we have to watch a manual instruction? Jetblue will not see me back as a customer. The prices are higher than the other airlines unless they are flying you on a special. The rude crews and the fact that JFK is the hub for Jetblue is enough reason for me to shop elsewhere!",jetblue-airways,22/08/10,Comfortable seats with plenty of leg room free snacks and first checked bags friendly staff. They occasionally face delays mechanical problems etc but as someone who flies them about once a month I can say that the vast majority of their flights are a joy.,9jetblue-airways,24/07/10,My work required last minute travel to New York City from Buffalo New York on a recent weekday morning. JetBlue website was easy to use and I booked a reasonably priced roundtrip flight. Flight to JFK was fine with just a slight delay departing BUF. However departure of return flight was delayed just about 3 hours but just 1/2 hour at a time. Two male flight attendants were a bit gruff and bossy with the passengers which has never been the case with many other JetBlue flights.,7jetblue-airways,21/07/10,A fantastic flight Tampa to Boston. Our trip home was also smooth and fun for the kids and parents. Flight attendants professional and nice and the pilots informative.,10jetblue-airways,15/07/10,My family took a flight to Disney and it was the most perfect airline experience. The seats were comfortable there was a wide assortment of refreshments. The trip was smooth sailing. Coming home we did experience a 45 minute wait time due to weather. But the captain kept us fully informed and we were on our way as soon as the weather permitted.,10jetblue-airways,02/07/10,"CLT-JFK. Getting through CLT check in/security was easy the one free bag was a nice touch as well. Boarding on time from CLT's new D terminal which offers good food and plentiful seating. Boarding on time and welcomed by a somewhat friendly female flight attendant who just continued to say Hi Hi Hi. No welcome aboard. Plenty of legroom and IFE was already turned on. Smooth flight chips and a drink were for 1.5 hour flight. The same female flight attendant was rude in asking an unaccompanied minor to ""Turn down your headphones. We can hear them in the front."" T5 at JFK is amazing. Overall great flight much better value than US and DL who fly this route.",8jetblue-airways,29/06/10,ROC-JFK-LGB Return. Rochester NY to JFK a new Embraer E190. Seat wide enough with enough legroom even for a large person such as myself. Short flight less than an hour in the air. JFK-LGB in a reasonably new A320. All flights on time or a little early. Flight attendants were reasonably outgoing and cheerful yet professional. JFK-LGB leg they let me have all the liquids I desired. I knew beforehand all JetBlue offers are snacks so I brought food along for the long flight. Same story on return trip. IFE worked as advertised. Bring along your own headphones if you can. Online check in is a breeze and highly recommended by the lines I observed trying to check in at LGB. I can't comment on their baggage handling as I did carry on.,10skywest-airlines,20/07/15,The plane was a CRJ operated by Skywest. I was warmly greeted at the door by a very nice FA. Service was excellent. The seating on the CRJ is 2-2 rather than 3-3 on the larger planes. The plane was very comfortable and quiet. No entertainment system due to the short flight.,10skywest-airlines,23/04/15,I am a regular flyer but only had my first experience with SkyWest last week on a flight from Milwaukee to LaGuardia. Unfortunately I have to say it was the worst experience I have had with an airline. I booked the flight via Delta who did not include baggage in the ticket price and would not allow me to pay for this immediately - I had to wait until it was time to check in. Very inconvenient. They then proceeded to rescheduled the time of the flight about four times. As a result I had to call them to reschedule to a later flight which resulted in my missing several hours of my NYC vacation. The later flight took off as scheduled but was very old and had the smallest seats I have ever seen and I am a small person. Safety is clearly not a priority for this airline as the flight attendants did not explain what to do in case of an emergency and by checking the safety card I discovered there were no life vests or life rafts on board. In the event of us landing on water we were to use the seat cushions to stay afloat! Considering this flight crossed Lake Michigan and Lake Erie and flew over the Atlantic before landing at LaGuardia I find it baffling that they would even consider not having life vests on board.,3skywest-airlines,05/01/15,LAX to SMF on 12-10-14. Small regional jet economy but in an exit row with more than adequate legroom. Uneventful flight decent airline would fly Skywest again.,7skywest-airlines,05/01/15,SMF to SLC - premium economy on Delta's regional carrier Skywest. In my experience seats on Skywest are more comfortable than the ones on Delta's larger aircraft. However the recline is minimal. Pleasant flight on time flight no food for purchase.,8skywest-airlines,05/01/15,SLC to OKC. My spouse gave me her first class (upgrade) boarding pass. I can't comment on value for money because this was a free ticket. However first class was disappointing no food served or available for purchase on a flight that boarded at 1:20pm. (we had a one-hour layover). The seats were wider than those in EC and with more legroom. I'd fly Skywest again but would not pay for a first class ticket. Other than the lack of food the flight was pleasant the FAs attentive and courteous.,7skywest-airlines,15/08/14,"SkyWest does not honor American Express/Delta free baggage deals. They are the only carrier in and out of some destinations like West Yellowstone. As a result even if you get your free checked bag from your original departure location/Delta flight you won't get it on the way home. The SkyWest ticket counter employee at West Yellowstone actually thought it was funny. She laughed at me when I complained. This was a ""Delta"" flight operated by SkyWest.",skywest-airlines,02/04/13,Traveled from Kalgoorlie to Perth. Aircraft used was a Fokker 100. The check-in was extremely quick. As always the plane was tidy and well kept the flight attendants are always polite and tidy. Skywest seats have more space then rival airlines on this route and are comfortable too. The flight included breakfast and unlike the rival airlines on this route you are given more then one option to choose from and a variety of drinks to select. I would recommend Skywest.,10skywest-airlines,25/01/13,Perth-Kalgoorlie same-day return. F50 outward F100 return. Quick and efficient check-in. Aircraft ageing but clean and well-kept inside and out. Seats reasonably comfortable for tall people. Ground and cabin staff friendly cheerful helpful and very professional. Was promised breakfast but only a snack provided. Ticket prices quite expensive even considering late booking.,7skywest-airlines,20/05/12,Perth-Busselton on Fokker 50. Terminal was new clean large and attractive. Quick check-in. I lost my boarding pass but was re-assured it didn't matter (which was a great relief)! Cabin crew were easy going and polite. Aircraft spotless. Small snack (rice crackers) and water were served. Very quick flight and comfortable but forgot to go to the toilet and didn't have the chance to get up as it was so quick! Arrived early with a smooth landing. Great information given by pilots (altitude weather) fare was $104.,9skywest-airlines,01/05/12,Busselton-Perth on F50. Check-in great and nice baggage allowance. Fare was $92. Delayed landing at Busselton but made up time in air. No food - was a disappointment. Only water served. Cabin crew didn't smile and made little eye contact. Comfortable flight. Toilets were pretty average. Pilot made great clear announcements. Aircraft in great condition the cabin had no mess and a nice magazine to read.,8skywest-airlines,09/02/12,"PER-KFE-PER Fokker F100. Alliance charter F100 on the way out to Cloudbreak. Cabin very old and worn out. Not surprising for mining charter flights. Breakfast not bad usual cold breakfast/cereal affair. Flight time nearly 2 hrs. No IFE or magazine. Return 5pm and F100 again. SkyWest aircraft this time. Meal was a very small snack but we landed at 7.15pm so dinner would have been more appropriate. Magazine provided but no IFE. Crew polite and easy going. Drinks were good and plentiful no alcohol unless purchased. Advice - don't sit in the last three rows as they aren't ""window"" seats as they are blocked by the engines and the noise is terrible.",7skywest-airlines,18/12/11,LAX to San Diego having flown into LAX with Delta and this was the connecting flight. Timetable for this flight allows 50 minutes but in reality it is nearer 20-25 minutes. Nice little Canadair jet very bright and clean inside. Left on time and arrived early. Two cabin staff seemed to be playing good cop bad cop. No drinks offered because it seems the flight is not long enough. Its a great little flight that does not climb too high and so you get a splendid view of Los Angeles. Once the plane was parked up we had to walk along the apron to the terminal building. Slightly longer wait then I had expected for so few passengers to get my luggage from the carousel.,8skywest-airlines,05/07/11,MEL-PER Via Kalgoorlie. XR22 Fokker 100. Due to not being able to locate the crew the flight was delayed by 1 hr at Melbourne. Due to strong winds between Melbourne and Kalgoorlie the flight was diverted to Adelaide to pick up extra fuel. The 5h20m flight turned out to be nearly 7 hrs. These tickets were extremely cheaper than the major airlines. Check-in was simple at Melbourne airport and the flight was extremely good. The Flight Attendants were down-to-earth and worked well for the full flight including the stops. They brought around food many times during the flight. Apart from this unexpected stop i would highly recommend Skywest for the Mel-Per route.,7skywest-airlines,28/05/11,Fokker 50 from Perth to Geraldton and Geraldton to Perth. Great service by cabin crew food provided was great. The disadvantage of Skywest flight right now is its delay. All my flights were delayed but mainly due to the small terminal of the airport. In addition the flights on this flight is very expensive due to lack of competition.,9skywest-airlines,11/02/11,SLC-FCA-SLC Delta connection branded CRJ200. Both directions crew was informative and friendly. Aircraft well maintained and clean. I can't complain about the service we received in 1hr 30min flight. Check in people at SLC are very busy with constant Skywest-Delta Connection flights leaving but efficient.,10skywest-airlines,02/01/11,Perth to Albany F50 early morning flight. Check-in well staffed so no waiting. Aircraft in good condition for its age and seat pitch generous. Friendly crew and a reasonable cooked breakfast served on this 1 hour flight. Departed and arrived ahead of schedule. Excellent service - my only gripe was the fare $201 is a lot for a 400km flight. More than half the seats were empty - they would surely fill more seats if they kept the price down.,8skywest-airlines,03/09/10,Darwin-Perth via Kununurra and Broome. Light food and beverage served on each leg by friendly and hard-working cabin crew. Aircraft interior trim was a bit worn but the seating was the most generous and comfortable I can remember in an economy cabin anywhere ever - this is how it should be! All up the flight took nearly 6 hours and we had to stay on the plane during stops but I would have had an expensive extra night in Darwin had I flown with anyone else. I got a very good fare booking well in advance but fares shot up to over $800 a week before - perhaps they should review this pricing policy because the plane was less than half full on 2 of the sectors.,9skywest-airlines,26/08/10,YEG-SFO return economy. We were placed in the exit row of the CRJ-700 on both flights. I'm not sure if this was pure luck or because of our FF memberships. Consequently we found the leg room excellent. The flight and cabin crew were good. The only beefs we had with SkyWest was that they charged for checking in our bag. We were not made aware of this charge before checking in.,7skywest-airlines,10/08/10,BUR-SFO. I flew First Class on a new CRJ-700 with excellent service. Flight crew professional and friendly. New seats on the CRJ very comfortable. More so than some of the larger domestic aircraft. OJ or water offered prior to take off from the flight attendant. Pillow and fleece blanket supplied. This flight exceeded my expectations for a regional flight. Returning was equally as good.,9skywest-airlines,17/06/10,PER-DRW-KNX-PER. All flights were fantastic heaps of legroom and complimentary meals with tea coffee or juice. Soft drink and beer available for a small charge. Complimentary newspapers on all seats too. The F100's seem to be aging a bit. Not bad at all for a local airline reminded of Ansett service.,9skywest-airlines,26/02/10,This was great for a low cost 55 min flight. Flew Perth-Albany and return. Check-in was fast large baggage allowance and check-in women was attentive. Boarding call clear and we were boarded within 10min from the call. 2 flight attendants for a small Fokker 50 (prop plane) great seats with good leg room and recline. Served a meal of great food. On the way back I was surprised that there was no security check at all! What great trust the airline/airport (Skywest is the only airline to fly to Albany) has in there passengers! On the way back they served a chicken sandwich with carrot cake and cookies! Only problem I had was that it was in plastic containers.,5skywest-airlines,08/02/10,Perth to Karratha on an F100. Friendly staff from the ground staff through to the cabin crew on-board. Aircraft showing it's age but the cabin service was efficient and friendly. Hot breakfast served with tea and coffee all included in the very cheap fare of $159. Skywest has lots of positives going for it and whilst these flights are aimed mainly at the mining companies they will continue to pick up other business with their good product.,4skywest-airlines,12/06/08,DEN-MLI (United branded flight). Had to walk outside to board plane which is fine. However left 15 minutes late since 3 other planes boarding from same gate at same time and people getting on wrong planes. CRJ-200 extremely outdated interior and air conditioning inoperable. FA told us to close shades for entire flight to keep plane from heating up which helped. Cabin crew pleasant. While I would say worst flight I have been on subtle nuances made up for it somewhat.,1skywest-airlines,27/05/08,PER-LEA return. Perth quick and efficient check-in and no queues at security screening. Boarding by walking across tarmac. Flying north I was travelling on a F-100 jet down they use a F-50 turboprop plane. Seat pitch is impressing. Catering okay and free of charge except if you'd like to drink beer or wine. FA attentive friendly. For the (high) fare you pay you get pretty good service. Check-in in Leamonth took ages due to a printer problem and there was no security screening in service which I found rather remarkable.,skywest-airlines,22/04/08,"In Modesto CA (a city of about 200000) Skywest is the only airline that serves our airport with multiple daily flights to both SFO and LAX (LAX service unfortunately to end soon). Realizing that one can't realistically expect a comfy Boeing or Airbus jet on these short thin routes Skywest does at least get you there - although anyone beginning his or her trip with Skywest or any regional should try to depart as early as possible as these planes easily get backlogged during their multi-segment days and are given last priority to land and big hub airports. I have flown Skywest many times to both airports recently. Unfortunately they use the dreaded Embraer Brasilia turboprop on those routes which is very cramped loud seats don't recline and the ""lav"" (it's a bit of a stretch to call it that) is nothing but a mid-sized compartment that even I at only 5'10"" can't stand up in. There is no running water. The sole F/A must actually crouch under the galley counter to allow you into the lavatory. All of us mid-sized Western city residents will breathe a huge sigh of relief when Skywest finally gets rid of all these dreadful beat-up planes and replaces them with regional jets!",3skywest-airlines,13/03/08,"RDM-SLC-DEN. Not real happy with Skywest/Delta Connection on this route. At RDM took agent a full 15 minutes to check me in she continually was having to refer to ""how to"" manuals to guide her through the process. Late incoming flight causing late departure was not told upon checkin nor was this reflected on monitors in the gate area. Later an announcement made that those with tight connections in SLC should come to make new connections however my ticket showed RDM-SLC-DEN as a simple stop in SLC same flight number to DEN single boarding pass. You guessed it it was one of those flights that shows up as a one-stop but is actually a different plane (I knew airlines did this on intl connections but didn't think that the regionals did it too.) Skywest ground staff in SLC were very shaky: three seeming trainees one slightly-more knowledgable one who had to guide all of them through the various situations they were trying to rebook.",skywest-airlines,14/07/07,Perth to Esperance return with SkyWest and most impressed. The breakfast going was real food fresh and tasty. On the return mid morning flight back to Perth the muffin was tasted just out of the oven. Nice coffee not bitter at all. Attendants were efficient and friendly. Legroom the best of any domestic airline in Oz.,skywest-airlines,26/01/07,Perth to Darwin via Broome. Fokker 100 was clean quiet and comfortable. The cabin crew were polite friendly and helpful. The food among the best airline food I have tasted. There was a large selection of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks available. Overall I had a highly enjoyable experience and would not hesitate to recommend flying with Skywest in Western Australia!,skywest-airlines,08/05/06,Perth to Exmouth. Very friendly crew and a good flight with the captain indulging in an overfly of Exmouth bay for a spot of whale watching!! Hot meal was supplied on the outward trip which was better than some other Carriers travelled. Highly recommended.,skywest-airlines,11/02/05,I've flown SkyWest on the SFO-EUG route many times (under United ticket and livery). They used to fly mainline United (737) on this route but have resorted to more frequent flights (5 a day) on this route with SkyWest. The CRJ 200s are spacious for their size and the FA is usually very friendly and attentive. I wouldn't want to fly more than 1.5 hrs on the CRJ 200 since leg room leaves a lot to be desired.,skywest-airlines,02/01/05,Travelled skywest while on honeymoon from Oakland to Salt Lake City in codesharing Delta. It was a CRJ flight for about 30 people -only 1 flight attendant on board. First time travelling in such a flight as in Asia smallest planes are B737/A320. Flight is comfortable flight steward very friendly made 2 rounds of drinks.,skywest-airlines,12/07/04,Had a flight with Skywest from Perth to Broome it was one of the best flights I have ever had. Flight attendants were excellent food services was very nice with the full tray that included very fresh food. The FAâ€™s came around with trays of drinks all the time and the nice touch was when we boarded at Broome after take off the came around with ice hand tows as it was very hot and humid at broom. What a 5 star service and I love there Fokker 100 aircraft very neat with all leather seats and the most leg room of any airline in Australia.,skywest-airlines,17/06/04,I recently flew Skywest as a Delta Connection from HLN to SLC. Although I don't like the level of the windows in the CRJ (you have to bend your neck down halfway to see out) the flight was very good and comfortable. It's amazing the room those little planes have. It was a very full flight. The F/A was a delight - very conscientious and attentive. The flight crew were good too. We got there way ahead of schedule. I was very impressed with Skywest.,skywest-airlines,09/01/04,The Flight Attendants were very professional efficient warm always smiling and extremely attentive. I felt like a guest rather than just one of their customers. I highly recommend flying with them if you come to visit Western Australia!,skywest-airlines,07/01/04,There is also a SkyWest Airlines in Australia that has a fleet of Fokker 50's and Fokker 100's. They also have frequent flyer agreements with Qantas.,southwest-airlines,27/07/15,I flew Southwest 5 times in the month of July and was delayed at least 2 hours for every flight. My parents are flying home on Southwest as we speak and are delayed 3 hours. Their plane made it to the runway and now is receiving maintenance while passengers remain on the plane with no a/c. Add at least 2 hours to any trip you book with southwest. Unacceptable service.,1southwest-airlines,27/07/15,"Flight from Seattle to San Jose - flight 923 - landed on time, but the connecting flight to Ontario - flight 4032 - scheduled to leave at 8.30pm was going to be delayed to an unknown time, as the lady behind the counter was telling us that the plane encountered mechanical problems but would post the exact departure time as soon as the plane was airborne. At exactly the same time the PA announcer explained the delay was due to fog over San Diego. Finally and after about two hours delay and the merging of the Phoenix flight with ours, we boarded heading to Ontario.",1southwest-airlines,27/07/15,"Flight 2674 from Ontario to San Jose was delayed about 40 minutes, lady behind counter claimed delay was due to mechanical problems, suggested to carry our luggage on so we can catch up with our connecting flight -flight 862- to Seattle. Unfortunately or maybe fortunately or it could have been planned that way, the flight to Seattle, was also delayed over one hour. Was told 20 people on the same plane boarded the plane heading to Seattle. ",1southwest-airlines,24/07/15,"I'm very upset that Southwest has chosen to implement this new boarding system. I'm flying with my 10y/o daughter. I checked in online and received what I thought were seat numbers. No, it was a boarding position. The flight was full and all the ""A boarding positions"" were taken so I couldn't even pay the extra $80 to increase the chances of my child sitting with me on the flight! I don't care where I sit on the plane, however, when I'm traveling with my 10 y/o daughter or any family, it's nice to sit with them. I would rather fly with an airline that assign seats upon check-in than to roll the dice to see if I can sit with my child. My first bag is free but to sit next to my child is $40 per ticket. Spirit Airlines doesn't even charge extra to assign seats to their passengers once they check in and Spirit charges for everything.",3southwest-airlines,23/07/15,"This is the first time that I've flown WN, so I didn't really know what to expect. Check in at BOS was efficient and the attendants were friendly. I opted to purchase the ""early bird check in"" and was slotted at A53. The aircraft was nice and clean. The FAs were friendly, and were helpful. The flight left on time, and actually landed 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I had no problem finding a seat that I liked. Based on this one experience, I would recommend and fly WN again.",10southwest-airlines,21/07/15,"On a recent flight originating from Fort Lauderdale, FL to Richmond, connecting in Atlanta, the plane arrived to the terminal on time and was expected to depart on time. After the incoming passengers exited, the person in charge of boarding made no attempt to load the plane. After a lengthy delay the passengers of flight 1505 were informed that a service technician was addressing a problem and the flight would incur a minor delay. In a confusing and poor miscommunication between the Gate personnel and the gate attendant we were given conflicting and garbled information as to new delays and would be given more updates as soon as the problem was closer to correction. I checked the Arrivals/Departures monitors and saw that numerous incoming and departing Southwest flights were being delayed by hours. Another update around 3 hours later informed us that the scheduled Flight 1505 would not be departing at all. A different plane would be assigned to Fort Lauderdale once it landed from Atlanta. This would be around 10.20 pm. We were finally asked to form a line to make arrangements for whatever Southwest could come up with. My best option was to wait until Monday to get back to Richmond. I tactfully informed the Gate Agent that that was not an option as I had a job to return to. I asked about a flight closer to Richmond, ready to be boarded. I was told that option wasn't available, and there was nothing left. Finally I asked if another flight could get us closer to Richmond, and a rental car be provided to drive the remaining distance. Again, nothing but the travel vouchers were offered. Then a option to book a flight to BWI was available, arriving at 2.00 am. No hotels were available. I again asked about car rental. I was informed Southwest didn't offer or would pay for a rental. No other airline was available either, seems SW doesn't work with anyone else either. We took the flight to BWI, and had to get a rental at 2.00 am.  Arriving home at 5.00 am, and with a extreme distaste for the way Southwest treats their paying customers, we decided never to use this carrier again. ",1southwest-airlines,20/07/15,"It's become the ""usual now"" I am a loyal Southwest customer, fly 2-3 weeks each month. Now delayed 3+hrs due to maintenance issues in La Guardia.

Not good for us as we had to connect with an Air New Zealand flight to NZ and the arrival time would leave us rushing to check-in for this flight. Ground staff were very good and got us on to a previous flight due to leave in 20 mins. We made our connection. Earlier in the trip we flew Southwest, LA to Nashville and New Orleans to Phoenix - both flights approx 40 mins late. Also our friends from Canada flew Phoenix to Seattle, same story, about 40-45 mins late leaving. Last Monday, the 13th, our daughter flew from Las Vegas to LA. The plane left 40 mins late.

My flight was supposed to leave at 10.20pm than changed to 11.35, and I'm still sitting here after midnight.",3southwest-airlines,14/07/15,"The gate/checking was in total disarray. The fare status was not updated, manual time displayed at the gate was outdated and the line was extremely long and stagnant at the gate. Passengers were not receiving adequate resolution or gate agents were not properly trained to address the situation. The gate was later changed with no communication, the boarding started with minimal communication. The flight was overbooked or consolidated with other flights and it was extremely uncomfortable. The flight did not leave at the updated delayed departure time posted. There was no communication from the staff who preferred to just talk to each other rather than the customers.",2southwest-airlines,14/07/15,After having an awful full day of waiting for each flight from DEN to MSP and not getting on any of them (flying standby) we had one last chance to get on the last flight out for the evening.

Aircraft clean. Cabin crew friendly. In my opinion, Southwest always delivers a consistent experience.",8southwest-airlines,11/07/15,"Southwest will fly you cheap. And they will be reasonably decent to you while you're flying with them. However if you ever need customer service from them it's different - when I called them, it took 112 minutes (no I'm not kidding) to get a human being on the line. When you're panicking because you've realized your wallet must have fallen out of your purse underneath the seat in front of you, and you just want someone to look for it, there will be no help for you. When you finally get a human being on the line, they will tell you to make a report online, and there's nothing else they're willing to do for you.",5southwest-airlines,08/07/15,"Traveled with spouse, daughter-in-law, and 18 month old grandchild. Purchased tickets for the adults in February, paying extra for early boarding. Daughter-in-law decided she wanted to purchase a ticket for her child and have her sit in an airline approved car seat on plane, instead of on her lap. Agent told her not to bother paying the early boarding fee when she purchased her child's ticket as the child would be boarding with her mother. My daughter-in-law traveled this way with her child several times on Southwest without a problem. However, at Fort Lauderdale, when she attempted to board the aircraft with her child, the agent told her that even though her ticket listed her boarding group as A23, her baby's ticket said boarding group C and she would have to wait for that group to be called! During the heated discussion that followed, several passengers behind us boarded the aircraft. Finally she was permitted on the aircraft. My husband went to sit in the seat across the aisle from us and was told that seat was taken. Another passenger claimed he was saving several seats (I believe it was 6) for his family. The flight attendant was standing just one row away and was aware of this behavior. My husband ended up sitting behind us. A woman who sat in the window seat near him plopped her bags on the seat and said to leave them there as she did not want to have anyone sit in the middle seat. It appears to me that Southwest needs to revise its seating procedure! If you have paid an extra fee for priority boarding you are entitled to board according to the status printed on your ticket. If your family members( who are not young children) have not paid for priority boarding, you should not be able to block passengers from claiming a seat for which they have paid an extra priority boarding fee. If you are unhappy if someone wants to claim a middle seat, too bad! You should be forced to sit there instead. The same goes for all the baggage folks drag on the plane. Half of the passengers look like they are fleeing a war ravaged land carrying on huge bags or multiple bags. If the airline would support their seating and baggage policies all passengers would be much less aggravated.",8southwest-airlines,08/07/15,"Traveling with a family through Southwest Airlines was terrible because we did not know of the free seating rule, even though our tickets said we had assigned seats. When I asked the attendant about this issue she was rude to me and my family. On our way back we flew through Southwest Airlines as well and were delayed (without explination) we had to spend the night in Chicago, paid for out of pocket! They tried to help us get a hotel but they booked us one in the wrong airport and almost made us pay for two hotel rooms. When we returned back to the Midway airport our next flight was also delayed making us late for work the next day.",1southwest-airlines,07/07/15,I am beyond disappointed with the delays I have experienced with Southwest Airlines lately. I have had a total of 8 flights with them in the last 6 months and not a single one has left on time. I'm not talking a 15 min delay I'm talking hours. It's not easy flying with a toddler but when you add hours of delays its just miserable. Needless to say I will be flying a different airline on my next trip.,4southwest-airlines,03/07/15,"Well generally Southwest is great with its customers. However, today I have just experienced awful customer service. There were two people transferring from my connecting flight from Baltimore to Columbus. Two, would you think that they would have the luggage at an easy to reach area. Now, can't always blame the airlines for this. Lost luggage happens. However, the reason behind my lost luggage was outrageous. After landing 15 minutes early of the scheduled landing time, my flight waited for an hour on the runway. Almost missed the last connecting flight to Columbus. When announced the terminals, they also noted that Southwest is not responsible for your missed flight, if you do miss it. My flight left at 10.10, I boarded at 10. I enjoy Southwest but unfortunately my last couple of times flying with them have been miserable. The other time, I was at the airport for 10 hours waiting on their planes, because they were delayed in the schedule. Again sometimes you can't do much about it, but figure it out!",4southwest-airlines,24/06/15,"PVD-BWI-DTW-BWI-PVD Outbound legs to Detroit uneventful and handled with Southwest efficiency. Return legs were problematic as there was a line of severe thunderstorms over Baltimore causing severe scheduling problems for one of the major hubs for Southwest. Southwest came through and got us back to Providence, albeit two hours late. The terminal monitors in Detroit kept us well informed of delays and the Southwest app (although a bit slow in updating) did also. For the people who complain about the boarding methodology of Southwest, it is a bit strange for the uninitiated, but it works and has worked successfully for many years. If you insist on assigned seating, donâ€™t fly Southwest - simple as that.  It is an airline that admittedly has its foibles, but even with that it is still an excellent product! .",9southwest-airlines,17/06/15,"My father was flying home to Syracuse NY afer a stay in a nursing home/rehabilitation center. His travel needs were significant as he was unable to walk and confined to a wheelchair. He was traveling with my 77 year old mother and my sister.

Both aircraft were clean, and staff was friendly, professional, and courteous. My only complaint was that the seats seemed a bit narrow and I am not a big guy.

Guess that is where our mistake was. Flight was delayed 1.5 hours (missing flight attendants) but would not inform us as to how long the delay would be (so the bags stayed with my son in Houston). If we would have known what was going on we could have gone back out to my waiting son and got our checked baggage. Numerous calls same lines of ""really sorry but we can't......."".

This has been the worst experiences of my life. The plane arrived a half hour late when we tried to take off we ended up being 11 in line to take off on the runway (which if there was a line we should be 30 mins ahead of the spot we were in). After waiting an hour on the runway we were unable to take off due to a storm that was off in the distance (not a big deal if they were on time however it was their fault for being late and getting caught in the storm). I have flown SW about 4 times now and not once have had a flight on time.

We did all we could to calm ""the children"" down. It lasted about 1/2 an hr in all believe me it was worse on us as we tried to keep them quiet. The people behind us were making comments out loud and then when we got off the plane we find out from friends of ours in the back of the plane said how the steward's were rudely commenting about our kids.

I have traveled quite a bit over the last many years I don't do much anymore but when I do I at least check things out. Many seem to be surprised at SW boarding procedures can't say I love it but at least I understand it. I paid the twelve dollars for a seating upgrade got A-37 out and A-43 back. Got on with plenty of seats and overhead space. If you don't like the charge go on another airline and pay $30+ to check your bag. The trip was fine but airline travel anymore is like bus travel used to be don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed or pay 5 times as much and go first class on another airline. I'm no spring chicken 70 years old and the seats are not great but again it's a bus not an airliner. I did fine would fly SW again if they had the best price and routing I always check around. All I can say is they got me there on time and that's what I paid for.,8southwest-airlines,08/05/15,Not allowed off the plane to get dinner during a one hour layover in Chicago. We had a 4 hour flight to Vegas ahead of us and we were told in Atlanta (our originating city) that we would be able to get off and get dinner in Chicago therefore we did not eat in Atlanta. We had 7 hours until we finally landed in Vegas to eat dinner 11.45pm (EST). Rude service refused to let us go and we had to sit on the plane for an hour while other passengers boarded. There was more than enough time to quickly grab food at the fast food venues next door. Very disappointed with the rude staff.,2southwest-airlines,28/04/15,Travelled ATL to MSY and back. Not able to check in early so ended up in the mid-B range both ways. Full planes but boarding went very smoothly except for the obese lady who needed two seats! We managed to get two seats together on the way back but were separate on the way out but its only a short flight. Seat reasonably comfortable with enough knee room. Soft drink and pretzels provided. Very good price. SWA use the Concourse C at ATL so by the time we had made our way to Baggage Reclaim it was starting to come off. Would use SWA again.,7southwest-airlines,26/04/15,"Rude staff disorganized boarding misinformation about boarding procedures packed in like rats in the smallest seat space I've seen. My friend 79 and I 70 flew to St Louis at the last minute on Southwest because of the price. I had called Southwest in advance to ask about their boarding process. ""Oh don't worry"" I was told ""You'll get boarding numbers together and will be able to choose seats that are together"". Nothing was said about their Early Bird Boarding. We boarded in the ignominious ""C"" group which means that there were only scattered middle seats left. I wound up in the middle. He wound up in the front. His carry-on suitcase was somewhere in the back. When I explained to an attendant that we were concerned about that baggage she said that there was nothing she could do to help me. Southwest lets oversized carry-ons aboard which fills up the overheads quickly. I would suggest that if you are over 60 years of age that you avoid Southwest Airlines.",southwest-airlines,17/04/15,I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that.,6southwest-airlines,06/04/15,22/03/15 - 29/03/15 a total of 7 flights over that time starting at BWI Baltimore and ending up at John Wayne CA via MDW SLC DEN and OAK. All left on time and arrived on time or early. Cannot fault them in any way given all flights were getaway tickets the price was right as well. From booking each flight to checking in and arrival they run rings around most other airlines in the USA and the EEC. Those who moan about free seating pay the extra few bucks and get an A boarding place you can afford that as your checked bags go free other wise stop moaning.,10southwest-airlines,29/03/15,I have had the worst experience with Southwest Airlines. My plane was initially supposed to board at 7.15 pm and departure at 7.45 however we did not start boarding until 7.50. Once on the plane we waited 20 minutes to depart but then the captain spoke informed us that the plane had been fuelled with too much fuel so we were going to have to wait 15 minutes for the de-fuelling process. After 25 minutes a Southwest Airlines representative came on the loud speaker apologized and informed us that the de-fuelling process would take about 70-90 minutes - not 15. I am very irritated by this Southwest experience and I know my fellow passengers were too.,southwest-airlines,28/03/15,"Horrible customer service representatives that are inefficient and inconsiderate. They diverted our flight and repeatedly made empty promises about time constraints which made it impossible to make other flight plans. The crew while nice gave no sympathetic apologies and just plainly didn't seem to care about situations aside from their own. Saying ""we're in the same boat as you are"". I thought that was rude considering they aren't in the same boat they're getting paid for this and should be apologizing profusely for the circumstances and lack of information communication to the passengers. This was without a doubt the worst experience I have had with an airline and I would not recommend using it for future trips. On top of all of this their boarding process is idiotic and if you have later back than A30 you better be ready to ride in the middle seat.",southwest-airlines,28/03/15,SWA 737-700 IND-RSW March 21st. We booked Southwest airlines Wanna Get Away for a very cheap price so we could sit together we paid for early bird check in and we were in Group B. I have to say I will now be flying Southwest almost exclusively because of the free IFE (although you need a device yourself) and the service is great. The 737 is also one of the more comfortable planes in the sky and I would much rather fly on it than a small RJ on Delta or having to connect in Charlotte. Overall I'm very happy with this airline and I look forward to my next flight with them.,10southwest-airlines,20/03/15,I have been traveling business select with Southwest twice a month for the past 3 years. I pay the extra money so I can board first to get my preferred window seat up close to the front on the Port side of the plane in order to quickly un-board either for another connection flight or to get on the road. My question is how can you rightfully sell a business select ticket when knowingly that there will be 40 people left on that plane during a connection which all 40 people will most always move forward after the un-boarding taking up most of the preferred seating area. Another question: I flew in on flight 2230 from New Orleans to San Antonio there was supposed to be no plane change in Dallas. Once we arrived in Dallas and everyone un-loaded except for the ones of us that were continuing on to S.A. Then we were told to get off and go to the next gate that there was another flight going to S.A. After several of us asked what was going on because of the plane change and the much later departure time of this flight (we never received an answer) then an hour later they announce that they are now waiting on another flight with 90 more people. This plane change and departure delay then became obvious there were no weather or mechanical issues they were combining 3 San Antonio flights into one to probably save fuel and personnel cost at the expense of their customer.,7southwest-airlines,17/03/15,LAS-LAX-LAS. Bizarre boarding process but once you get your head round it boarding is very quick. Extremely friendly crew on both flights. Complementary drink and baggage policy is excellent! Very easy to amend flights and with no charge! You don't get that with the low cost airlines in the UK!,8southwest-airlines,17/03/15,The worst airline I have flown. San Diego to Vegas Friday 13th Feb. At check-in told there is no allocated seating. Nowhere to sit in departure lounge hardly anywhere to stand. We were in one of the last groups to board as we moved into the line the girl handling boarding called us to the front to tell my daughter who is pregnant that she was allowed priority boarding as she is classed as disabled being pregnant. We accepted it and boarded sat at the rear of the cabin but luckily sitting together no room in overhead lockers so glad we had checked bag in. Never come across such an untidy cabin crew. Turned down the offer of a drink and was shocked they serve peanuts must be one of the few airlines that still do. Return flight on the 15th played the pregnant card for all it was worth boarded first row one seat locker for baggage no improvement in cabin crew. It was a once only flight with them we are spoiled in Australia with our airlines who get it right most of the time.,southwest-airlines,17/03/15,On our trip to USA used Southwest Airlines from LA to Sa nFrancisco - Atlanta - Orlando - Las Vegas and then back to LA (5 flights) excellent service. We were recommended to ask for pre-board due to 2 young children with a disability seating was not a problem. Staff were extremely nice to us. Recommend Southwest to our friends.,10southwest-airlines,17/03/15,Just flew from Orlando to Austin. Even though I was informed that there was WiFi there wasn't any. My wife tried to use the restroom and she said that the condition was horrible. I wonder if this was cleaned between flights. Any announcements were unintelligible due to poor sound system and the speed of speech. I tried to contact their customer service and I noticed that it's about the only department that does not have a toll free number. I rest my case.,3southwest-airlines,24/02/15,Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore. Do not recommend.,2southwest-airlines,18/02/15,"Took a flight from Southwest last week to Las Vegas. Upon trying to return home from Las Vegas my flight was canceled because of equipment problems. There were no other connecting flights that day for my itinerary. As a result Southwest offered several alternatives. We stayed an additional night in Vegas as a result. This was paid for by Southwest. All transportation was supplied by Southwest to and from the hotel. This was first class service! My only peeve and it is a small one was that I had an ""A"" first on pass originally and my replaced flight the next day was a ""B"" category.

Purchased early bird check-in in a bid to protect a better boarding position (and overhead bin space). Was assigned mid-A group so did get the seat location and bin space I was after. The entire boarding process is just a bit too odd for my liking with numbered posts and suspicious-looking 'post squatters.' I didn't need a calculator to know there were some queue jumpers at least within the 'A' group. Seating is just ok I thought the pitch was a bit tighter than the 32"" advertised and while I got the seat location I wanted I ended up with a group 'C' middle-seat'r who felt entitled to both armrests and wasn't exactly on the lean side. The in-flight service was fine the aircraft new and bright the flight crew fairly amenable and the flight left and arrived on time. Just can't get past the boarding system though. It just seems too cattle-roundup oriented.",7southwest-airlines,18/02/15,Friday 13th 2015 flight 2745 from San Diego to Phoenix. I will never fly Southwest again gate agent was so rude bossing people around and just the worst customer service ever. And of course the seating is a total nightmare not sure how this airline is still in business.,southwest-airlines,18/02/15,"Tampa FL to Phoenix AZ on 2/5. Don't waste your money on the extra $25.00 per ticket for each travel day to have Early Bird check in. It is a total waste of money. For our first flight from Tampa FL to Phoenix on 2/5/15 I paid the extra $25 for each ticket and our position in line was A59 and A60. That is supposed to mean that 58 people ahead of us also paid the extra $25 to have expedited boarding. On the return Southwest Flight from Phoenix to Tampa on 2/10 our positions in line were B26 and B27. When I asked the ticket agent at 2 different locations why our boarding passes were so far back I was told that it has to do with: 1) the number of people on the flight (there were 175 people on the flight) so I was told that at least half of them selected the Early Bird check in option. 2) when I got online to purchase my fare tickets and what the fare was (I purchased our tickets on 12/15/14 with the ""Wanna get away"" fare). 3) when I got online to pre-board (I did this exactly 24 hours ahead of boarding time). So to be the 119th person of 175 people on board this plane at least 118 people paid the Early Bird fee? No I asked the people ahead of us in line and they had not paid the extra $25 per ticket per flight. I also asked some of the people in the A line and they had not purchased the Early Bird option. Evaluation: do not spend the extra $25 - it is a total waste of money.",4southwest-airlines,18/02/15,While traveling from Mexico to SAT my wife and I decided to give Southwest our first try we travel about 3 to 4 times out of DSM and we had never used your services. The flight was delayed about an hour because of some issues with landing at the prior airport once we boarded the plane the captain apologized for the inconvenience I wasn't aware of the seating process either but yet happy to be able to seat anywhere in the airplane the 3 flight attendants were extremely attentive with my two children they offered a lid for my sons cup so he wouldn't spill his juice all over his homework. They made us feel like they cared about us and they seem happy to be there. When one of the flight attendants realized we were a military family she offered to pay for our drinks. something not one other airline had ever done. Overall it was a very pleasant flight.,10southwest-airlines,12/02/15,I flew from Richmond to Fort Myers by way of Atlanta. I was boarded and the problems began. Plane was supposed to leave at 4.25. After 30 minutes of waiting they told the passengers that an outside compartment was stuck open. Had to call maintenance in. Over an hour delay we took off. I asked flight attendant about my transfer in Atlanta she snipped back check at the gate. Got to the gate to find out my connecting plane was already boarding. Went to board and was told my ticket was not good. Got out of line and went to try to resolve this issue. They had changed my flight to the next day. Finally got it straight. Asked about luggage they said no problem it would be on the plane with me. I was the last to board and a day later still no luggage. Very disappointed.,southwest-airlines,06/02/15,RNO-LAS LAS-RNO. As always on this route SW delivers. Ground staff in Reno were great and flexible. On time departure flight crew attentive and the pilot even pointed out sights of interest on the way down. Luggage arrived promptly in Vegas. Return flight just the same. Will continue my loyalty to this airline.,10southwest-airlines,30/01/15,"Flew WN twice this week: BDL-BWI-RSW and RSW-ATL-BDL. Both flights were on time. Attentive and congenial ticket counter gate and inflight personnel who really seemed to enjoy their job and their customers. The crew on the BWI-RSW leg actually sang portions of the pre-departure announcements. Having been subjected to callous treatment and the ""we don't care we don't have to"" attitude of personnel on some of the other airlines Southwest is a refreshing change of pace. They won me over.",10southwest-airlines,21/01/15,"I recently took a trip from Albany to Orlando and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the boarding process is a little strange as long as you check in on time there is a very good chance that you will find good seats even if you are traveling with family members. I got B27 because I checked in a little late but I was still able to get a window seat over the wing like I wanted. And since I only brought a suitcase and a small duffel bag I didn't have to check any luggage which is free for two bags anyway. I am 5' 3"" and small but I imagine that someone much taller and larger would still be as comfortable as I was in the seats. The planes were very clean and the staff were very welcoming and enthusiastic especially on the way down to Orlando. The flight attendants are quite funny during the safety briefing and manage to make you feel as if you are listening to a human being instead of a monotonous robot. They were also sympathetic when our flight back to Albany from Baltimore was delayed about an hour and our gate was switched twice and the captain addressed us personally to apologize. As all three of my flights were less than 3 hours each I didn't order anything but the complimentary snacks were a nice touch. Although each plane I flew on was wifi-equipped I did not purchase it but I did use the free flight tracker. Overall Southwest offered outstanding service and comfort at a lower price than most other airlines that I have flown on. Southwest has given me an experience that I would gladly repeat many times.",10southwest-airlines,19/01/15,"First I don't know how anyone that left a review here can honestly say they had plenty of room you all must be very small people. This plane ride from John Wayne Airport to Houston was miserable the free seating is probably the worst idea ever. To make it worse they don't care about your boarding pass order I got on the same as a C31 when I was a B1. The plane is so cramped I could not even put my tray down without it being on my knees. The flight had no delays although for comfort I would take a delay. The ""free"" wifi is a marketing scheme they actually charge you 8 dollars and you are extremely limited on what you can do. This was a round-trip both times family and friends were trying to save seats. This is supposed to be first come first serve - I did not get to sit with the person I traveled with. Instead both times I sat in the middle seat with people about as big as I am.",southwest-airlines,14/01/15,"My only complaint is that individuals and families were trying to ""save"" seats for other people on a full flight. Seating is a first come first served basis. That's the reason for the line up when boarding the plane. If you can't get your boarding passes together then don't expect to sit together. Southwest needs to make an announcement at the beginning of the boarding session to ensure that people know this.",5southwest-airlines,14/01/15,Recently my wife and I had a round-trip to Jamaica. Our flight 1042 from Chicago on Dec 26 was delayed 1.5 hrs because one of the lavatories was found non-operational. However the crew learned about it after all passengers had boarded the plane. Boarding started on time on the way back from Montego Bay however after a third of all passengers had boarded the crew found out that 3 seats were non-operational. The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago. Could the problem with 3 seats identified before starting the boarding? I think Southwest has some opportunities for improving operations.,7southwest-airlines,14/01/15,SAN-LAS. Dec 31st. B737-700. Crowds and crowds. But everything went Ok with SW. Lines to drop off were quick. Boarding was quick. Flight was quick. Even luggage delivery in LAS was quick. The quicker the better. And 2 suitcases for free is fantastic. LAS-BUR. Jan 2nd. B737-700. Same thing. In both cases they said free wi-fi but try to charge. I did not understand.,8southwest-airlines,11/01/15,We flew round trip from Baltimore Washington International to Aruba on December 22 2014. We arrived at 6am for our 8.45 am flight and the lines were long for check in. Curbside check in was not any better. The International line was shorter so we were able to process through in a reasonable amount of time. It was a nice flight with no problems. For our return trip the hotel staff recommended that we get to the airport three hours early. The check in process was very well handled and we even went through the United States Customs before boarding the plane. This made it very easy when we arrived in Baltimore to grab our luggage and go. The return flight had the best flight crew I have ever flown with. The attitude and customer service skills made this flight very enjoyable. Our only complaint was there was no inflight movies available for a 4.5 hour flight.,10southwest-airlines,11/01/15,"My wife and I experienced Southwest at it's worst on a flight from Montego Bay Jamaica - you just can't make this up. Flight Delay in MBJ - 3pm flight left MBJ AT 9:30pm told that the plane was originally diverted due to Southwest forgetting to renew its license to fly over Cuba. Complete lack of communication by Southwest staff during 6 hour delay. Once on the plane at MBJ the cabin crew promptly told us that the delay ""was not their fault so don't take it out on us"". No apology - just that statement. Deplaning delayed 15 minutes at MCO due to incorrect gate height. 1+ hour wait after customs at Southwest counter for new flight and hotel/flight voucher - there were only 2 agents. Couldn't get a flight voucher as Southwest took all computers down for their own overnight daily maintenance. Had to go back and stand in line again in the morning to receive flight vouchers. Rebooked flight of course had C boarding group - had to beg for the ""heart"" stamp by agents to allow us to board as B1. Flight to MHT on the 14th was delayed 30 minutes making us have to run to make our connection in BWI.",southwest-airlines,05/01/15,Flew SWA in the last week from BWI-RSW-BWI. First plane was older (737-300) had no WIFI. Seats in the older plane seemed larger/more comfortable than the newer one. Bathroom wasn't cleaned very well (if at all). Second plane was newer (737-700) and had WIFI but it was $8 for a 2 hour flight so I didn't buy it. Other than that they got us to each location on time.,7southwest-airlines,05/01/15,SFO-LAS flight delayed 20 minutes which is fine considering its a budget airline I didn't expect much on the service complimentary 2 pieces check-in baggage is very delightful spacious legroom friendly cabin crew free soft drinks served very enjoyable experience with SouthWest.,9southwest-airlines,22/12/14,"My family my husband and I and our two children ages 11 and 14 are well seasoned travelers. We live in the NY area and fly out of LaGuardia several times a year. We know LaGuardia is a busy and cramped airport and deal with it. This weekend was the first time we've ever flown Southwest. Southwest is the worst airline we have been on. Who came up with no assigned seating? We were traveling with my 88 year old mother in law who had to stand in ""line B"" while we were in ""line a"". We had to take her luggage because she was not in our seating group and she isn't strong enough to get her suitcase in the overhead bin or savvy enough to pull a suitcase down a cramped aisle. There were no guarantees that my family of five that spend well over $1000 for our flights (in total) were even going to be seated together. Our 11 year old son has anxiety issues and likes to sit by a window when we fly. I never book a flight unless I can see the seating chart and pick our seats before I pay for the flight. This wasn't even an option for us. So I was anxious because I was afraid we would be stuck in separate seats. I had to set my alarm on my phone so I remembered to check in exactly 24 hours in advance so we could secure a good seating assignment. Our flight out of LaGuardia was a nightmare! There's nowhere to sit in the terminal by the gate. So my 88 year old mother in law had to stand until we boarded. There were no TV monitors on telling us when we were going to board. We had been standing in line for about twenty minutes before we realized there wasn't even a plane at the gate. And they had customers singing over the loud speakers as entertainment. They never announced when we were going to start boarding. And once on the plane we sat on the ground for an hour and a half and the pilot never came on and told us we had a delay and how long it was going to be. I do know that I will never fly Southwest again.",1southwest-airlines,12/11/14,Las Vegas to Baltimore then to Portland. Our scheduled flight from Baltimore to Portland was delayed (sick crew member). Southwest gave a $100 LUV voucher. They also don't charge to change or cancel flights. They need to make sure that carry on bags will fit in overhead compartments. Many did not and had to be checked which delayed the flight.,9southwest-airlines,12/11/14,"On November 6 2014 flew from West Palm Beach to Las Vegas via Atlanta in Business Select. Had not flow SW in years but it is apparent the service has deteriorated. The open seating is a joke and as well as the Business Select status. Pre Boards get the best seats which are clearly exit rows and the first row. I was traveling with someone who is 6'3"" and 275lbs. and it was torture for them to sit in a very small seat with no leg room to elbow room and hard seats. Staff are rude and have poor attitudes.",1southwest-airlines,06/11/14,My mother and I arrived into Dayton Ohio last October and surprisingly there was a wheelchair on the jet way. My mother uses a walker but we were advised to use the wheelchair because she would have a difficult time walking all the way to baggage claim. We were taken all the way to baggage claim through the rental car kiosk and then all the way to our rental car. We also had help to load our luggage. Same service on return and I can't say enough good things about it. Taken from the curb to the check in counter and all the way to our gate.,5southwest-airlines,06/11/14,First time in a while flying Southwest and as usual a pleasant straightforward experience. Easy-to-use website for reservations optional boarding pass for a few bucks extra fairly efficient boarding. My flight was from BWI to Las Vegas and I opted to pay $8 for WiFi. Southwest fulfilled their goal - moving me across the country in 5 hours or so - a great job without all of the hidden fees.,10southwest-airlines,06/11/14,I just recently flew to the east coast departing from the west coast. This was the first time I tried flying with Southwest and have absolutely no regrets. I experienced no delays. My flights were on time and 30 minutes early at one of my layovers. I found the staff very nice and it made my flight fun. I will stay with southwest from now on when I fly. Thanks Southwest for such an enjoyable trip across country!,10southwest-airlines,22/10/14,My husband and I both fly frequently between Ohio and New York and Florida so this review is based on many flights. Southwest has become my preferred airline. As a senior checking my bags for free means I don't have to lift a bag overhead that is getting increasingly difficult. No change fee means I don't have to buy insurance. The staff are wonderful boarding is done in an efficient way and you can get a convenient and moderately priced flight without having to fly at 5.30am. Would only use another when I have to match a specific time frame that is not available.,10southwest-airlines,20/10/14,I love flying Southwest but the reason why I fly other airlines is do to the very slow baggage claim at Love Field. I took a flight from Cleveland to Love Field #4221 October 11 2014. It took one hour from the time our flight landed until the bags were delivered. One hour I could not believe it. They build that nice building but have no way of telling passages which of the four baggage carousels your bags will be delivered on so people scurry from one to another looking. Even after the bags arrive the Southwest team member usually is to busy to announce baggage drop until 4 or 5 bags have arrived. You spent a lot of money to rebuild that airport you would think that you could make the bags arrive in 20 or less minutes.,8southwest-airlines,13/10/14,My family and I traveled last spring from Akron to Tampa on Airtran / Southwest Airlines. When we arrived at the airport the flight was delayed due to mechanical failure for 2 hours. Original posted delay turned into multiple delays promised another plane which didn't show when expected. 8 hours later we were still waiting. Our patience as well as the entire waiting crowd was gone. The staff at the gate were authorized to reimburse passengers with certificate travel for the inconvenience. Ok great (we thought). I have tried to use our certificates in several different ways. 1) We had already purchased tickets for a trip later in the summer (same airline) asked if we could cancel those and use the certificates NO. 2) Asked if we could use the certificates for additional family members to travel with us NO. 3) Tried to book a flight for another trip sorry certificate seats sold out. 4) Tried to book again on a different date NO because that put us past the travel dates on the certificate. 5) Last try today and told that the certificates are expired and no longer valid. What does a person have to do to use certificate travel? Travel to destinations nobody wants to go on dates no one wants to travel? If a certificate travel is given as a gesture of good will for inconveniences endured due to airline failure shouldn't the recipient be able to use at their convenience not the airlines?,southwest-airlines,13/10/14,This was the first time and last time I will fly Southwest - our flight was delayed in Chicago numerous times and our flight that should have left a couple of hours after we arrived finally left about 12 hours later. At one time we were boarded and then told the pilot had worked too many hours. We were given a $200 voucher $200 cash would have better since I will never fly Southwest again I will gladly pay more with another airline.,southwest-airlines,13/10/14,DCA-MDW on Oct 1 with B737-700 flight delayed 30 minutes which is fine cabin is clean and really spacious legroom even it's budget airline. I was surprised that complimentary beverages and chips were served! Complimentary movies and TV shows provided when you connected inflight wifi with own devices. Staff very helpful and friendly. Will fly with Southwest again definitely!,10southwest-airlines,28/09/14,Sep 14 on flight 648 from DEN to PHL and Sep 20 on flight 1329 from PHL to DEN. So impressed with Southwest! Just finished our fourth flight with our infant son and I'm just so thankful for the amazing crews we've dealt with each time. So understanding and accommodating. As first time parents we really appreciated the great service.,10southwest-airlines,24/09/14,"I paid for the early bird check in as I do on most of my flights. I checked in online the day before at 3.30pm which is 5 hours after I needed to if I didn't pay for the earlybird check in. When I check-in I was given A31 and A32 but didn't print my boarding pass as I didn't have access to a printer. The next morning before my flight I printed my boarding pass and was given B32 and B33. When I got to the gate I asked the front desk women at the gate what was going on. She said ""we don't guarantee what number you get."" I told her that I checked in and received A31/32 and she told me again. ""We don't guarantee the numbers."" I told her that this was a rip-off and that if I wasn't traveling with another family I probably wouldn't have made a big deal but since they also checked the same time I did and they received B28/29/30 and didn't pay for the earlybird that something was wrong. She told me that there is nothing she can do and I'd have to write Southwest for a reply. She looked things up on her computer and said that the earlybird for this flight never went through on my flight back. I will be looking for other airlines for my flights for now on.",southwest-airlines,19/09/14,"Live near BWI one of SW biggest hubs. Use SW for short non-stops but even those are becoming intolerable. Flight attendants show up after boarding time. Apparently unconcerned that delay 150 or so people so they can have 10 more minutes to do whatever. Rude instructions when boarding. Told to put my bag in bin down the aisle despite having space above my seat ""to save room for other bags"" unbelievably stupid as I have to go against traffic to retrieve bag now. They've gone from a ""cattle car"" (based on their Southwest origins) to a chicken coop. They advertise heavily ""bags fly free"" - didn't know they meant they would treat live human customers as baggage.",1southwest-airlines,19/09/14,"I was a loyal Southwest customer who hadn't flown in a while. After five flights within the same week all I can say is Southwest isn't what it used to be. For a 6'5"" 200 lb person the new seats are sheer torture. And on every flight I encountered too many passengers being crammed in to too-small planes. It's no surprise that every logistic being run on such a razor's edge makes for a stressful experience. God help you if you have to endure any connecting flights. The schedules are so tight now that they have no time to even clean the planes between boardings and there are lots of delays. What a terrible atmosphere we encountered. The staff tries their best to pretend they aren't running a grim cattle drive but no one is fooled. I guess corporate has decided to maximize volume and profits over any considerations of passenger comfort. Too bad. Southwest used to be different from the sleazy mentalities running most other airlines.",4southwest-airlines,17/09/14,"We have always loved Southwest Airlines. Over the years they have become our ""go to"" airlines. That's why the first time there was mechanical delay we didn't let that impact our view of the airlines. Then in the same week we had another mechanical delay. Now don't get me wrong I would much rather them find out problems while the aircraft is still on the ground! Today ( all delays have been within the same week and half) there is another mechanical delay! This makes three in a short time span. What's going on with Southwest airlines aircraft? As I said before I would rather find problems on the ground but three delays on three different aircraft's all mechanical issues is reason for concern! It turns out a mechanic accidentally opened up the bathroom sewage and it poured out into the aisle of the plane. No one is getting on that plane anytime soon!",5southwest-airlines,17/09/14,"I will never fly Southwest again. They claim there is no assigned seating but you can purchase ""Early Bird Check- in"" which they claim automatically checks you in 36 hours in advance instead of the usual 24 hours. So I purchased the Early Bird check in plan thinking that my whole family would be able to sit together. (Group A-so I thought). Surprise when I received my boarding passes we were in Group B which means you have less that a 50% chance of your family seating together. I called Southwest and was told that the Early Bird Check in does not guarantee anything it just gives you the best available boarding at that time Well they didn't tell me this when they took my money. So in order to ensure that my family would be together I had to spend more money and purchase First-In boarding passes (Group A) for an additional $40 per person (One way). The plane was small cramped no room to even think about being comfortable. I am an average size man (5'11 195 lbs). I can't imagine how someone bigger must have felt. Then imagine my surprise when the flight attendant announced to the final group of people boarding (Group C) to take the first available seat because they were saving the seats in the back for families so they could sit with their children. Twice I spent money to guarantee my family would sit together because they claim there is no assigned seating and now they are saving seats for families so they can sit together Are they serious!! Either you have assigned seating or you don't. Which is it? It is clear that Southwest doesn't have their act together and I believe they are not worth the hassle. I won't fly them again and certainly would not recommend them to anyone.",2southwest-airlines,14/09/14,"I recently flew with Southwest. I was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. Although I was aware that the Southwest boarding system was different I had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. Long story short: whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. I needed to travel within the last few weeks from St Louis International airport to Washington Dulles International airport. I would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. In order to get a better seat on the airplane I paid the extra money for a business select ticket. This puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. Southwest seating is first come first serve. On my way to D.C. the system worked well enough although on my first flight I did not get a great seat as I was boarding in position A15. That didn't bother me much the system had worked as designed. My second flight I was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. However on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. The problem started when it was time to board after a layover at Midway airport in Chicago. Now I first want to say that I support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to pre-board. But I do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. My ticket from Midway to St Louis had me boarding in position A1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for pre-boarding. There were four pre-board passengers ahead of me. When the gate agent called for pre-boarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. Not acceptable. By the time I got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. The four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. Why can't Southwest declare the front row an ""exit row""? It is an exit row! That would prevent pre-boarders from sitting there. What did I pay extra for to get priority seating if Southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people? In the end: I paid and they did not deliver. I recommend that if you choose to fly Southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. I personally will not be flying Southwest again under any circumstances.",4southwest-airlines,14/09/14,"I was hesitant to fly Southwest because I'd heard the ""cattle call"" remarks from others but honestly it was fine. I paid the $25 for my sister and I to do the early bird check-in which I will always do from now on. We boarded quickly and took off on time. I enjoyed sitting up front on the way to Phoenix (I'm claustrophobic so the extra room made for a more comfortable feeling overall). Coming back we were a few rows back and it was cramped for sure. That's to be expected on a smaller jet with smaller seats. For a domestic flight it's doable. What I was really impressed with was the overall attitude and presence of the crew. I have always flown Delta in the past and was surprised to see the pilots before the flight. The flight attendants were very nice. The flight back to Atlanta was interesting as there were weather issues but the pilot did a great job of navigating around and through the worst of it I believe as there was hardly any turbulence. I'll fly SW again for sure.",9southwest-airlines,06/09/14,On-time flights don't exist. I had 2 round trip flights in 2 weeks for a total of 4 departures. All 4 were 20-30 or more minutes late. 100% failure rate for that. Your luggage flies for free but that doesn't outweigh the chronic tardiness issue. If you want in flight entertainment you must download their app but I couldn't ever get it to work. User error I'm sure. At least they provided a quarter of a soda in a cup during the flight. If you book Southwest your flight will be late. That is the Southwest guarantee.,1southwest-airlines,28/08/14,"Plane was supposed to depart at 10.25AM it is 11.20am now and we are still waiting to leave. No beverages have been offered and everyone on the flight is becoming frustrated. They made an announcement while I am writing this review. They said ""we are still repairing the aircraft and we will update in 15 minutes or so."" This is absolutely ridiculous. A full flight sitting in a hot plane for an hour now and we are about to take off in a plane that has just been repaired. My multiple time flying with Southwest and this will be my last.",southwest-airlines,28/08/14,We are flying from Birmingham to Albany. Before deplaning we learned there is an hour delay for our 2 hour layover in Baltimore. We are not surprised as my husband had a 2 hr delay from Albany to Jackson a few days ago my sister in law had a 2 hr delay flying from DC to Panama City and we were delayed 3 hrs flying from LaGuardia in our layover in Nashville. If you want to get anywhere on time I would suggest a different airline. We have almost a full day of list time in delays and have been offered no apologies and no compensation. This is our vacation time and we work hard all year for it it is valuable family time and we've paid richly to be robbed of it. I will never fly Southwest again.,southwest-airlines,28/08/14,My 94 year old mother-in-law and I flew Southwest from San Jose CA to Austin TX on July 29th 2014 and she flew back alone on August 16th 2014. We had outstanding service in every way before and on both flights. The folks who met us with her wheelchair were so accommodating polite and respectful. The ticket agents helped us in every way possible even when we thought we had some difficult issues. The attendants on the plane were very friendly and so kind. We and she alone on the way back could not have asked for better service. We will both definitely fly Southwest again.,10southwest-airlines,28/08/14,San Diego to Las Vegas 13th Aug. Las Vegas to San Francisco 15th Aug. Seeing as people seem to only write bad reviews about Southwest I decided to write a very positive review. I had 2 separate flights with Southwest in a week. Both flights were excellent. Most probably the friendliest staff and crew I have come across on any airline. The emergency demonstrations are witty and funny and do not sound like a robot that does not want to be there. They also offer free beverages and a small snack on board which is a nice gesture to get you through a short flight. There are a very efficient airline. We had no delays and baggage was returned quickly once off the aircraft. I would recommend Southwest to anyone flying within the US. They are truly cheap and cheerful.,10southwest-airlines,20/08/14,August 16 flight 74 Indianapolis to Orlando. In great contrast to our August 11 trip from Orlando to Indianapolis (Flt 4453) that provided the usual friendly service from Southwest attendants our experience today was the exact opposite. Upon boarding our experience was very positive with the attendant who seated us and helped with storing our carry-ons. We never saw that person again since she must have been working the back of the plane. The attendants in the front of the plane (a male and female) did their job and that was about it - bare minimum. From the outset when we boarded they seemed to lack interest were detached and somewhat edgy. I noted the male attendant was unnecessary rude to two male passengers when he could have been much more polite in both verbal exchanges that I overheard.,2southwest-airlines,20/08/14,My wife and I are from Australia but when we come to the States we try to fly Southwest whenever practical because they deserve the business due to their fair business practices and good service. We've always appreciated that they don't charge for luggage and that a person can change flights without any charge. We flew them a number of times last month and I can say only good things about them. We will continue to support them in the future when we come to the States and I wish they operated here in Australia.,9southwest-airlines,20/08/14,July-August 2014. Los Angeles-Midway Chigao-Louisville-Las Vegas-Los Angeles. Once again excellent airline. Cannot find anything to complain about. Staff and service fantastic. On time. Of course food and beverages you pay for but have no issue with that. 2 free checked luggage a bonus.,10southwest-airlines,20/08/14,Flight 2534 BWI to Providence on 17 Aug return BOS to BWI on 19 Aug on 3059 travelling to Cape Cod. I was a little apprehensive about flying Southwest having read the reviews but I must confess I was very impressed. Boarding was carried out promptly and according to the rules of seating on both flights. Both flights left on time the flight attendants were pleasant and engaging. On the return flight the pilot met passengers at the door and shook my hand and thanked us for flying Southwest! Drink orders were processed promptly and small snacks were handed out. The return flight had in flight wifi with TV and movies on demand. All in all it was value for money and when I am back in the US I would use them again without a doubt.,10southwest-airlines,15/08/14,LAX-MKE-SEA. For me Southwest has always been a superb US domestic carrier and these trips were no different. A tip is to purchase for $10 the early check-in which gets you into the A group boarding. well worth the efforts not to have to fight for a seat.,10southwest-airlines,14/08/14,I flew on Flight 3276 from ATL to TPA on August 9. This was my very first flight on Southwest and hopefully my last as they kept on delaying the flight to avoid paying for hotel rooms for passengers who were late coming from a connecting flight. I will say that I have never experienced this flying with multiple other airlines and I will do everything I can from here on to avoid flying with Southwest Airlines.,southwest-airlines,14/08/14,I heard last week that Southwest is the largest airline in the US now. Unfortunately I think their growth has resulted in decreased novelty and satisfaction. I do fly it on a regular basis because they service MDW from LAX but I find that the amount of space for seats is poor the wifi is the worst that I have found in the market in recent years (I work a lot on planes and SW wifi is very very slow). It is not worth looking at inflight snacks as the quality is so poor. It is now just an airline with less than average amenities.,4southwest-airlines,11/08/14,I recently traveled from Louisville to Orlando no problems the flight was very smooth no problems with the luggage and arrived in Orlando thirty minutes ahead of schedule. The flight home went very smooth also no problems at all overall I was very pleased and plan on using Southwest again.,9southwest-airlines,08/08/14,We recently travelled from Burbank to Denver. This is the worst airline I have travelled with. The flight attendants were rude too with bad attitudes. This airline also allow full size cases on board instead of the usual hand luggage resulting in those with genuine hand luggage to force under a seat which resulted in cramped seating and no leg room. Thank goodness the flight was only 2 hours 20 minutes which was long enough in those conditions. They also don't allocate seating resulting in a free for all.,southwest-airlines,08/08/14,85 boy Scouts took flight 63 on 8/2/14. All staff were so pleasant and went around 3 times to make sure we were good with drinks. That was really impressive. They were so kind and even let us know our gates for connecting flights. Nice job! Everything was great.,10southwest-airlines,08/08/14,Currently on board the plane traveling from Chicago to San Diego using the wifi I purchased for a whopping $8.00. Aside from being able to access a few sites on my iPad (ironically this is one of them) the wifi enabled me to do virtually nothing. I could not open my Netflix/HBO app because they were incapable of connecting to the network so I tried their respective online websites to access my media. Once again the websites were unable to load due to the wifi and I found myself soon discovering more and more entertainment related websites/apps (games/music/etc.) were unable to load. Apparently their definition of wifi limits you to reading Wikipedia articles and twiddling your thumbs while you constantly refresh pages. Needless to say I will not be making this purchasing mistake again however I will be traveling Southwest again in my future as they are still by far the best bang for your buck!,5southwest-airlines,08/08/14,I booked a trip to fly from Houston to Lubbock with a stop in Austin. The flight went smoothly from Houston to Austin in Austin I had a 2 hour stopover until my flight to Lubbock I fell asleep and missed my flight and when I went to the gate agent saying that I missed my flight she just shrugged and showed me two boarding passes and said I could get on a flight to Lubbock via Dallas I accepted and she gave me the boarding pass. The flight to Dallas kept getting delayed because of thunderstorms in Dallas. I finally got to Lubbock at 10.50. The next morning I went on Southwest.com and went to see if my points had posted I found out they didn't so I called Southwest and they told me that I didn't receive my points because I missed my original flight. I will never fly Southwest again because they have terrible service.,1southwest-airlines,08/08/14,Due to a family emergency I was forced to fly SW again on Sunday August 3rd (even after I promised myself never again after 3 other bad experiences in SW). My first flight went out okay but the connection in Baltimore was awful. First they asked for 3 volunteers to trade their seats for $300 vouchers due to SW oversold the flight. After we finally boarded the plane the captain announces a mechanical malfunction so we all had to deplaned. They began lying to people in order to keep them calmed. after they decided that each flight should go in 2 different groups (Orlando and Raleigh) Another hour passed and we were still don't know the real reason we couldn't board a 2nd plane .Two hrs later they decided to switch gates again and telling us that because plane #2 also had a mechanical problem we have to now board plane #3! All of the sudden they announced that the two initial flights became one again what a mess! I finally arrived to my emergency 3 hrs later.,southwest-airlines,03/08/14,It is too bad the people that seem to post on the web are the ones that have had poor experiences. I fly almost weekly on Southwest for the last 6 years. It is with trepidation that I fly other airlines as you never know what you are going to get-especially Delta. The customer service is second to none and the seats are always roomy and predictable. Unless you need the extra leg room such as an exit row if you check in at the 24 hour mark or pay the low fee to board early you have a large selection of seats. Rarely are they late. The staff are empowered to solve customer issues and do so readily. Airline tickets are easy to change and credit refund with no fees. Plus there is no baggage fee for the first 2 bags and their pricing is competitive. Airline miles are so easy to use including international. This airline develops trust based on their reliability and customer service. Definitely a loyal fan and steady customer!,10southwest-airlines,03/08/14,Flight 4111 on 7/26 and 3371 on 7/31. This airline not only messed up my flight down to Florida but also messed up my flight back home this is the worst airline choice you can possibly have if you decide to book a flight make sure you book it for the earliest possible time because you won't end up on a plane until the middle of the night anyways. This is such a terrible airline.,southwest-airlines,29/07/14,"FLL to MSP and return. Staff must've taken how to not smile and treat everyone like cattle as part of their classes because on every flight we took (there were 4 total for the round trip) all attendants were almost disgruntled employees. They looked like they ""had"" to be there. An elderly woman who couldn't sit with her young grandchild who was very nervous about that (because of their no assigned seats policy) was delighted when another customer volunteered to switch seats with her before they even started the seat belt instructions and the first flight attendant reprimanded them and then I saw her tell the second attendant who rolled her eyes. Come on that made the flight more enjoyable for everyone plus what was the big deal to them? Our soft drinks took almost the whole flight to get to us and then they ask for your garbage right after you start drinking it. The seats are comfortable enough but there is no perks to paying the extra $12 a ticket for the early bird check in unless you are just partial to a window seat. I got A30-36 boarding most times which is after the first A group picks all the leg room seats. The only thing I like is that you can control whether or not you sit in front of kids if you don't want to you find a seat in front of adults already sitting.",4southwest-airlines,29/07/14,My husband took a flight to go to a funeral in Charlotte NC this past month. The flight down was fine the flight back however was a nightmare! They canceled the flight with no prior warning and did nothing to help their passengers from being stranded in the airport. In fact the customer service representative was horrendous. When I called to try to fix the problem she not only had no sympathy for the stress they were causing their customers but she also laughed at me when I was voicing my concerns about the fact that the only flight she was offering us was for Wednesday and his original flight was for Monday. The only solution she had was either take the Wednesday flight and figure out a place to stay for 2 nights or they will refund our ticket price (not the fees included with the ticket) and we were tasked with finding another flight with a different airline to get home. Southwest has no issue with leaving their customers stranded in an airport with no alternative plan than to find your own way home. I would never recommend them as they dont care about their customer experience at all and refuse to respond to complaints.,southwest-airlines,27/07/14,Went on vacation July 9-18. Flight out to Denver was ok - nothing special. Seats were very cramped. Flight 2068 back from Denver to Boston was horrible! To start flight was delayed twice. We were a party of 4 sitting all the way in the back. From the time we got in the air until about three quarters of the way through the flight the two female flight attendants and one male flight attendant were just horrible. When one of the females came around asking for beverage requests I asked for a coffee. Everyone in my party received their drink except me no coffee. But it got worse! After drinks were served these three attendants proceeded to stand in the back by the bathroom and galley and talk and laugh extremely loudly with no regard whatsoever for all of us in the back of the plane including two toddlers who were trying to sleep. They kept up their loud talking and shrieking laughter for over an hour. It was absolutely horrible and disrespectful. I will never fly Southwest again.,1southwest-airlines,27/07/14,Burbank-Phoenix SWA286. Phoenix-Buffalo SWA197. July 17th. My first time flying Southwest and I was very impressed. Customer Service was the best I have seen and I have been on United Delta American etc. I was flying from Burbank to Buffalo via Phoenix and the first flight was 15 minutes early and the 2nd flight was right on time! I read a lot of people on here do not like the seating policy I honestly love it it is very simple and you choose which seat you want and Southwest is known for being the quickest airline for planing and deplaning. Flight attendants were very nice I liked the humor they used for their announcements. You have complimentary non- alcoholic drinks and they give you a bag of peanuts and pretzels. All in all I would recommend Southwest.,10southwest-airlines,17/07/14,When and if Southwest changes its seating policy I will consider flying it again. Unfortunately is pretty much the only airline that flies to ISP but I hate the seating policy so much that for my upcoming trip I will fly into JFK and take a shuttle. SW likes to say that its seating policy is freedom of choice choose any seat you want but that is not true. There is a hierarchy for seating which they charge extra for and then after paying all these extra fees you could still wind up with a lousy seat. We paid extra and were able to snag bulkhead but not exit row for the first leg of our trip because those were taken by mostly short people who don't need the leg room but who had boarded first. Then we had to change planes. Unfortunately the connecting flight originated from somewhere else and the plane was already half full so not only could we not get any leg room but we couldn't even sit together. Paying extra for better boarding is like playing roulette you take your chances and the odds are against you. I'd rather pay extra to choose my seat and know that it is guaranteed. The whole boarding process is so stressful because some people are pushing to get ahead of other people and everyone is rushing to grab the seat they want not knowing if they are going to be out of luck or not. Then after you get your seat the flight attendants are trying to get people to volunteer to give it up so a family can sit together. The whole thing is absurd. On top of all of this their prices are often not the lowest. I can fly into JFK pay extra for premium seating and afford a shuttle for what a Southwest flight to ISP costs.,southwest-airlines,13/07/14,Our flight from Orlando to Denver was full. I checked in about 23 hours before departure and got group C boarding passes. They want you to buy the automatic check in so they can get extra money out of you. My wife and I had to sit about 6 rows apart. The return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and when we tried to switch to an earlier flight they wanted $347 to change so we waited. This flight we checked in for when we arrived at the airport and got group C again. Flight was full but we at least got seats across the aisle from each other. I'm done flying Southwest I would rather have assigned seating even if I have to pay a bit more. I don't know why the flight was delayed in Denver never got an explanation. Too many pre-boarders families etc. that your boarding pass doesn't really mean anything anyway.,southwest-airlines,13/07/14,SJC to PDX. I have never experienced such poor Customer Service in the 13 years I have been traveling with this airline. I have been getting the feeling that the service had lost its world renowned status for the last few years. I stayed with this airline for their frequency and on time performance. Despite having a huge incentive voucher from Alaska Airlines I will say that after this experience I have completely given up on Southwest Airlines as a competitor. I was greeted by a Customer Service Representative with a mouthful of French Fry! After being told that my flight was delayed four hours due to an earlier mechanical problem. I asked why I was not notified prior to my on time arrival at the airport? The representative said that due to operational irregularities there was no way of notifying passengers of the delay. After waiting four hours with no communication form Southwest employees an announcement was made. My flight was going to be canceled and we could all receive vouchers. The chaos that ensued was unreal. Before I knew what was happening there was a line of 100 plus passengers waiting to get vouchers. I opted to leave the airport and fly Alaska Airlines the next day.,southwest-airlines,01/07/14,"We planned a trip from Pittsburgh Airport to Memphis Airport (supposed to be a 4hr 45min trip). We were traveling with a 3 yr old. We arrived at Pittsburgh Airport with our flight scheduled to leave at 6.30pm when checking in they said that our flight was delayed due to bad weather and offered to move us to a flight leaving at 4.45pm we agreed and actually made it in time to board. Once it was our turn to board we were told our boarding passes were not valid and had to get out of line to go back to the lady at the boarding counter to receive new boarding tickets. We finally boarded the plane and eventually made it to our first lay-over at Chicago Airport. Ended up waiting at this airport for almost 5 hrs for our plane to arrive. Yet again when trying to board we handed the lady our boarding passes and she scanned them and was told they were invalid. Again we had to get out of line and wait until we were cleared by whomever she called about the matter. After finally getting on the plane we waited an additional 20 minutes for a passenger who for some reason or another was late. Finally we landed at Memphis Airport at 11.15pm an hour behind schedule and thank goodness our rental car place was kind enough to wait 20+ minutes after they closed at 11pm so we could get our rental we had reserved. I was hoping our flight home would be less eventful not so lucky! We arrived at Memphis Airport and things went smoothly (I had high hopes after this) we arrived at Orlando FL airport. Once we arrived at Orlando airport things went downhill. We almost immediately found out that our 4.15 flight to Pittsburgh was delayed due to ""weather"" and wouldn't be leaving until 6.45 pm. After trying to figure out a plan we called customer service at Southwest and was told that she didn't know why we were told that our flight was delayed due to weather in fact it had to make an emergency landing in Baltimore due to mechanical issues. 6 long hours later we finally took off around 7pm and arrived at Pittsburgh Airport 5 hrs behind schedule at 11.40pm. I can insure after this experience I will be flying with another airline!",southwest-airlines,01/07/14,"Today when I showed at the airport I was informed that my flight would be late and that I had to be re-routed. This change puts me at my destination airport approximately 3 hours later than my original ticket. My wife and children now have to pick me up well past their normal bed time (our children are young). Additionally my boarding number is well past what I had checked in with for my original flight (instead of early B I'm now late C). I now have to wait at my departure airport 4.5 hours instead of my planned 1.5 hours. This type of customer handling is unacceptable. Southwest Airlines is supposed to be one of the top tier airlines in regards to customer satisfaction however my treatment today was truly unexpected. I should have been upgraded to business class seating (A1-A15) at least at a discounted price. Instead I was offered nothing for my inconveniences as well as my family's. I truly understand that things happen outside of Southwest's control but I think some concession should have been offered. This would have made me feel better. Instead I feel like Southwest's attitude towards it's passengers/customers is ""deal with it"" with a smile and a nod and a ""next customer please"" attitude.",southwest-airlines,01/07/14,"Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay. Southwest cannot and will not do the same.",southwest-airlines,01/07/14,My daughters were competing in Orlando Florida. My wife scheduled an 8.30 am flight 3 months ago to make sure to be there. Right after the passengers boarded the flight the pilot announced to passengers that there was a problem with the plane. The passengers deplaned and were told that SW was working on getting another plane a direct flight. There was no direct flight offered and after being told they would be leaving at 5 different times SW finally decided to bump the 3pm flight for the 8.30 am passengers. For all my wife's troubles she was given a measly $200 voucher. She could have driven from Dallas to Orlando faster than SW got her there.,southwest-airlines,01/07/14,"Southwest's Boarding Process has gotten completely out of control. I haven't flown on Southwest in about a year but my experience on a recent round-trip from Phoenix to Boston with connections proved repeatedly how flyers are abusing Southwest's boarding process. On the first leg I was assigned B38 since I did not pay for EarlyBird seating although I did check in exactly 24 hours before the flight. By the time they got to B31-60 practically the entire flight had boarded. At least 20 people were in the pre-board category about 5 A-list flyers who hadn't gotten an A number boarded after all the A's were called and then another 26 people boarded during ""families and children"". There were less than 30 people remaining to board the plane (which was entirely full) by the time they got to the B31-60 category - when technically there should have been 75-90 people left to board. This experience was repeated on all four flights and was worse when leaving BWI when a group of ""C"" pass holders snuck into the B segment and were not stopped by the gate agent. The final straw was the flight from Chicago to Phoenix. I watched a family walking through the airport to check-in at which point the parents asked for a wheelchair for their young daughter - who had been walking with them up to that point. A wheelchair was commandeered and they were expedited through the TSA check-point. Lo and behold when I arrived at my gate weren't they there - and with a pre-board pass. So clearly another way to bypass Southwest's procedures is just to commandeer a wheelchair and then you get to pre-board. It really is time for Southwest to just start assigning seats; the flying public it has been demonstrated will otherwise continue to outmanoeuvre and get around the ""rules.""",5southwest-airlines,23/06/14,I was scheduled to leave for Minneapolis at 7.55 last night. Yes there was a heavy rainstorm and yes flights were delayed. But Southwest seems completely incapable of telling passengers what's going on or correcting a problem. I was then told the plane would leave at 11.15 then it's leaving at 12.15 am. Then it's leaving at 1.30 am. 2 am they let us on the plane and we wait for an hour. Pilot time has been used up so we have to wait for another pilot. We wait an hour. No pilot. Flight is canceled. I make reservations for a flight out that morning at 5.30. Get my ticket go to the gate. Cancelled. So where's the bag that I checked on the flight. They can't provide any answers. All they seem capable of telling me is that was an act of God and therefore they are not responsible for anything that happened. Yes it's cheap but that's no excuse for treating everyone like cattle. I will never travel on it again.,southwest-airlines,23/06/14,Today was my second time taking Southwest. The 7am flight from LAX to SFO was cancelled for maintenance issues. They did not have a backup plane at LAX to accommodate their passengers. The solution that they came up with was to book all of the passengers on Standby to SFO and OAK. I am now waiting to find out even if we can fly at 9.20am or not. Which can't be answered until 8.50am. This is an unacceptable way to treat customers and I am sure is ruining more than the start of my vacation. This is the time that people book to have a get away for the weekend.,southwest-airlines,23/06/14,Southwest was my 'go-to' airline for the past 20 years. This past week I took a flight from Denver to Boston a 4-hour flight that left 7 hours late. The last 4 hours was attributed to weather. The first 3 hours of delay were never explained. No responsibility taken by Southwest. No coupons offered. I will never under any circumstance purchase a Southwest flight again.,1southwest-airlines,23/06/14,Ever since JetBlue left Tucson International Airport my husband and I have been loyal Southwest customers who fly four times yearly between TUS and LGA. Flights are convenient prices are good there's no charge for baggage service is friendly seats are comfortable and we have experienced rare delays. Interestingly enough the passengers are friendly and helpful to one another despite open seating.,10southwest-airlines,18/06/14,"I'm a loyal Southwest flier and recently had an awful experience. While flying from BWI to JAX we were told we were about to start boarding. They boarded all pre-board passengers then shut the door claiming the plane wasn't ready to board. The loaded and unloaded all luggage for what was later explained to us as an ""oil leak"". This whole time the pre-board passengers were still on the plane with no air what-so-ever. After 15-20 minutes they boarded the rest of the passengers. They then told us that the AC wouldn't properly work because the engine was too hot so we all sat cramped in our seats sweating for the two hour flight. No moving air at all. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.",2southwest-airlines,16/06/14,Today was my first time flying with Southwest Airlines and I must say that I am very disappointed. Our connection flight had to be rescheduled by Southwest and by how they scheduled it we had only 30 minutes to make our next flight which turned into 2 minutes when the initial flight was delayed by the airline. Needless to say we did not make our flight. What should have been a five hour travel day turned into an all day travel day which was very long and tiresome for me especially since I am eight months pregnant. It would have made the experience a lot better if Southwest would have somehow reimbursed us for some of the flight or offered us a discount for future flights since the delays were of no fault of our own. The flight attendants were nice and the people at the ticket counters were overall nice but overall the travel experience was very disappointing. Not a fun way to start our babymoon vacation.,3southwest-airlines,10/06/14,Haven't flown Southwest for quite a while. I am now sitting at the airport in Seattle waiting for my flight to Phoenix the flight has been delayed 3 hrs and they said there are no other flights available. It has been back and forth from a 3 hour delay to a 6 hour delay who knows what time we will actually depart. Doubt I will fly Southwest again.,5southwest-airlines,05/06/14,I received an early notice that the flight was going to be delayed one hour. Okay that is not a problem. When I got on the flight one hour later I sat for another additional hour! My flight was delayed over two hours one hour was just spent sitting on the plane. Turns out Southwest overbooked the flight. The flight attendants also had no idea what was going on. While on the plane they made an announcement that if anyone would volunteer to go on a later flight they would get reimbursed and have a free round trip flight. Very disorganized. I had a rehearsal dinner to attend that I made only the last few minutes of. I doubt I will fly Southwest anymore.,3southwest-airlines,05/06/14,"After being delayed 4 hours in Raleigh Durham I caught a flight to Baltimore and on to Kansas City. I sat in an aisle seat next to a large 300+ pound man. Obviously I leaned out into the aisle to accommodate for the gentleman. My feet never were in the aisle but my shoulder was. Throughout the 2.5 hour flight I was bumped progressively harder in my shoulder 8 times by the only female flight attendant on staff. Never once when she was walking towards me from the front. Always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. Never once an ""excuse me"" or a turn around to see what she'd just hit. Seemed pretty intentional after the last one before landing in KC. Maybe she would be of more use loading bags somewhere away from others?",3southwest-airlines,05/06/14,Southwest Airlines has joined the ranks of all other airlines: Poor and unsupporting. Stuck my two sons in St. Louis for 24 hours due to a mechanical in Denver. Routing to Grand Rapids was via Orlando. Watch out for the fact they cannot/do not interline. United and Delta had flights open but the loaner (SWA) wont play with the others. Ended up buying them tickets on American (for less money) to get them home.,southwest-airlines,26/05/14,LGA to HOU on May 18th. Easy check-in online and baggage drop at the airport. Organized boarding. Clean aircraft. Good legroom and comfy seat. Crew were fabulous offered snacks and drinks. Although we left 20 min late from LGA we arrived at HOU 15 min earlier. Our luggage was delivered shortly afterwards.,10southwest-airlines,25/05/14,I won't fly Southwest anymore. I was a loyal customer for 13 years. I feel this company has lost sight of there core value Customer service. The idea of adding 6 extra seats to there Boeing 737 configuration is a travesty. The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight. But if you don't show up for the flight they have no problem taking your money with no refund or accommodation.,2southwest-airlines,24/05/14,My last 4 flights out of Nashville have been delayed anyway from 45 minutes to 3 hours. I am a student and I like flying Southwest because of the flight change policy and 2 free bags. However going forward I may change my airline from Nashville to Boston. I would rather have a layover on-time then a 3 hour delay every time I fly.,4southwest-airlines,20/05/14,I am thinking of taking a different airline for my future travels. The major reason I had chosen Southwest was the 2 free checked bags but on this last trip there was more damage to the contents of the bags then a fee would have cost me. Since I am pregnant and was tired after my flight I did not check my second bag until the next day and that is when I found the broken items. The bag did not seem damaged and the items where wrapped in towels and other clothes. Customer service said they could not do anything about it though since I did not report it within four hours. So if you choose to use them in the future check your luggage right away.,4southwest-airlines,17/05/14,Had the worst flight ever from South West. We were stuck on the plane from 9am - 7pm PST with no food. My husband 18 month old baby and I were supposed to fly from Raleigh to Portland Oregon. We noted our layovers in Houston and Kansas City and planned on getting food during the stops. When our first flight landed in Houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight. Same thing happened in Kansas City. There was no optional food we could purchase. We were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl. We had also planned on purchasing WiFi to have our daughter watch Netflix which was also unavailable. Insult to injury the last leg of the flight when I went to change my daughter's diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing. I have tried to email Southwest Airlines in hopes to know my complaints were heard and no response. I have also tried Twitter on multiple occasions.,1southwest-airlines,16/05/14,"Something seems to have changed at Southwest. For many years SW was the only airline we wanted to fly because: on-time schedules nice staff/crew all around good operation. Recently (week of May 8-15 '14) my family experienced sub quality performance from SW (flights from Dallas and Albuquerque to Orlando and back). Schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said ""we'll fly when we fly"" (weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place. Flying out of Orlando was a total fiasco. The flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ""on-time"" departures when in fact the departure time had already passed. Travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet. Finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards (the SW rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldn't say when the flight would take off). So 3.5 hours later our plane takes off. Connecting flights of course didn't happen because our flights were at the end of the day. In Phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to re-schedule. We were lucky enough to find one ticket rep (Homero) who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance. SW offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the night-the info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pick-up available. My conclusion is that perhaps SW has gotten too big (with Airtran acquisition) and has lost control of some operations. SW is at its best as a short haul regional airline. Cross country flights (3 hours +) are off schedule and uncomfortable. The good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they don't have the information and support that they need.",6southwest-airlines,16/05/14,I have flown Southwest several times. This is my first time to write a review. We flew from Little Rock to Las Vegas. On the way back we were late to board and missed the flight. They put our luggage on another plane and couldn't guarantee when they would get to Little Rock. They put us on a flight to Chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on. From Chicago we got a plane to Little Rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again. We were about five hours or so later than if we hadn't missed our original flight. All I can say the Southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to Little Rock our luggage came in about forty-five minutes later. All I can say about Southwest is good. The flight attendants were very nice too all of them. When we came into Las Vegas the plane went over the Hoover Dam with a very good view I made a comment about the view when I got off and told the pilot I was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks. A little humor thrown in. When I fly it will be with Southwest I have never had any trouble.,10southwest-airlines,11/05/14,This is the first and last time I will fly Southwest. Our flight was delayed from L.A. to Chicago and our connecting flight was also delayed. The connection left an hour earlier than the listed time on the website. The next available flight was 17hrs later. The customer service agents were rude condescending and were of no help at all. We rented a car to drive 12 hours home but not before waiting 4 hours for our luggage. This service is shameful. I will never fly Southwest again and I would never recommend this airline.,southwest-airlines,08/05/14,I will never fly this Airline again. Flight 37 was to take off at 4.50pm from Houston to Atlanta and due to weather conditions it was delayed which was understandable. However we were never updated on the flight we kept being told that the flight was in route when it apparently wasn't and finally after 5 hours the plane arrived from Dallas - a 1 hour flight. Then we were told after it arrived that the Pilot had timed out and couldn't fly anymore. Just lies and more lies and finally a Supervisor informed us that another flight was supposed to arrive at 12.10 am and at this point we are still waiting. There was no accurate information disseminated at no time! I understand that things happen but accurate communication is essential but this was totally ridiculous and unacceptable!,southwest-airlines,06/05/14,"Flight 490 Tampa to Albany NY. April 30 2014. Love the free two bags at check-in. Hate the 737-700 seats. I'm 6' 2"" 230 lbs. there is no way I can sit and be comfortable. Those seats are ridiculous.",5southwest-airlines,04/05/14,This was the first and last time I plan to fly with Southwest/Transair. The plane was dirty and noisy. The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. It was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. I am only 5 feet 2 but I could not even get my legs comfortable. There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. The only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but I can find that with any airline. I will definitely be going back to the airline I have been using for decades. That way I know what I will be getting for my money. Sorry but this one bad flight put a sour taste in my mouth and wallet.,southwest-airlines,03/05/14,Not very impressed. It's been my third time the flight has been delayed and I got a 15 minute heads up of course that update was completely useless as I was already being reassigned planes. Taking into consideration that nothing can be done about poor weather the boarding process is awful and the representatives at the Fort Lauderdale front desk seemed very inconvenienced that they had to re-book us. It would really have made a difference if some genuine expression was portrayed.,southwest-airlines,03/05/14,March 30th 2014. Hartford Ct. to Las Vegas. While waiting to board the flight I noticed a very angry looking male flight attendant wandering around the gate area he was on our flight and his mood didn't improve for the entire 5.5 hour flight. During a short period of relatively smooth air the crew started taking drink orders. Fortunately on the way home the crew were very pleasant with passengers. The plane was a 737-700 fairly comfortable and the free snacks were a nice surprise.,10southwest-airlines,30/04/14,I think the boarding process with un-assigned seats is outdated and treats folks like cattle. You have no clue if you will be sitting with the person you are traveling with. On the first flight I had a great seating number had to be re-routed due to plane problems and was near-last on the re-routed flight. Sat in the middle seat (without my travel partner) for four hours. On the way back I checked in 20 hours in advance and was the very last person boarding. How is it that I can check in that early and every single person be seated ahead of me? Again sat in the middle and without my travel partner. The upgrade offer is nothing more than a bribe. I won't fly Southwest again.,3southwest-airlines,27/04/14,"Flew St. Louis to Orlando and return. Online check in was very easy and I got an ""A"" boarding cards both times checking in 24 hours ahead of time. Planes left and arrived on time. FAs were in a good mood and very friendly. Soft drinks and pretzels and peanuts were served. Luggage was free and arrived quickly.",9southwest-airlines,27/04/14,"Sitting in SFO waiting for my surprise surprise delayed Southwest flight to Orange County. When I called them this morning to see what the delay was the agent said ""It''s SFO they're always backed up"". Funny thing is I'm here sitting with my sister who has a flight to LAX on time on Virgin airlines not to mention no delays on any of Virgin's flight out of SFO. Sure Southwest is cheaper but if you want to get some where on time or you would prefer not to spend your free time hanging out at an airport don't use Southwest. My flight here was delayed as well. In fact I don't recall an on-time flight with Southwest.",1southwest-airlines,21/04/14,I had my two minor sons fly from my mom's in OAK to LAX. When they arrived at the airport my mother went about getting them checked in. They were treated as if they were 18 and 25! They were not boarded separately note were they seated by flight attendants. The attendants only offered he usual snack and drink and when they deplaned they were sent off of the plane into LAX terminal unaccompanied! When I asked about the policy we were told that since our 13 year old was over the age of 11 he was responsible for our six year old traveling with him. This is a cash cow low class airline which I will never allow my kids to travel on again! Southwest flight 950 from Oakland to Los Angeles on Friday April 18 2014.,1southwest-airlines,19/04/14,BUF-MCO-BUF. The unassigned seating is such a pain because then you have flight attendants yelling at you to choose any available seat. Both flights were on a Boeing 737-300. Cramped seating but flight attendants were polite and nice once you were in the air. In-flight magazine is terrible but the free snacks ands drinks helped. Although Southwest does have some of the best baggage policies in all of North America.,7southwest-airlines,19/04/14,EWR-HOU-EWR. I flew on an early flight to Houston Hobby. The flight was extremely empty and there was a ton of seats. I got A23 and A24 for that flight. Staff were quite attentive and provided us with snacks and drinks. We got into Houston around the time we should get there. Our return flight was delayed 90 minutes and we got a different plane. There were also delays at EWR so I just had to deal with it. The staff was just as attentive. Once we landed one of the flight attendants did apologize for the delay. Although I did not check any bags they got off the plane extremely quickly. I would fly them again!,7southwest-airlines,16/04/14,"Return trip from Denver change in Baltimore than land in Islip NY landing at 8.45pm. I did not know that the first leg of the trip was stopping in Louisville but I learned that a ""direct"" flight does not mean non-stop. Louisville to Baltimore was canceled and I was the only passenger that they let on all others were stopped and told about the situation. There was no announcement about the cancellation so when we landed in Louisville I asked the flight attendant and she sent me to the gate attendant who put me on a flight to Chicago then to LaGuardia airport landing at 12.00am. Told my luggage was left on the plane that was going to Orlando. Turns out my luggage didn't go to Orlando and was taken off in Louisville. It eventually made its way to Islip the next day. Because of the late arrival and distance from home I was forced to get a car service at a cost of $120.",southwest-airlines,16/04/14,I have avoided using Southwest in the past as I don't like lines pushing and shoving or unassigned seating. Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats. Although the staff was affable and tried their best I found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for Business Select.,2southwest-airlines,14/04/14,The airline is fine as far as on time baggage goes through quickly staff are friendly and helpful. However the boarding procedure (no assigned seats) is just a way to charge people for a reasonable line placement. So when considering flying SW with a family that would like sitting together add from 15 to 40 dollars to the price of a ticket and purchase the upgrade. All and all a fine airline for those flying alone but not family friendly.,5southwest-airlines,03/04/14,Southwest 1696 on April 1st from Baltimore to Denver. By using the rapid rewards debit card we got throughout the year we are able to take a vacation for no more than $30 each year ($30 is tax). We always check in on the dot of 24 hours before departure and usually get A or B boarding groups. We love that we get to choose our own seat. The staff are always very friendly and the new free TV on board every flight is my 2 kids favorite past time.,10southwest-airlines,02/04/14,I was horrified by the policy of changing flights at SouthWest. I had a round trip ticket and was able to return home earlier so arrived at Nashville airport 11.30 looking to get on the almost empty 1.20 pm flight. I was informed that I would have to pay $250 to purchase a new ONE WAY ticket home. I paid less than that for the round-trip flight. I did not expect this since I was told that SW was customer friendly and did not charge change fees. No they just charge you for a whole new ticket instead. I am trapped in Nashville for the next 8.5 hours thanks to their policy.,southwest-airlines,18/03/14,Having flown 45 weeks or so annually and now scaling back I fly Southwest for both business and pleasure. Southwest is an easy transition. With all the cutbacks and cattle calls that airlines have migrated to SW at least makes it simple ABC. If you can't figure that out sit in the middle. Their gate attendants are knowledgeable take the same stupid questions over and over yet answer them in a polite manner.,8southwest-airlines,13/03/14,My husband and I will avoid Southwest/AirTran at all costs. Vacation to Cabo 3/1/14 with connections in Denver. 1 hour late getting off ground in Milwaukee as plane was over weight and they had to kick 8 people off. Late arrival in Denver forced mad rush to gate in different terminal for connection to Cabo. Returning to Milwaukee 3/10/14 plane was 1 hour late getting in and leaving Cabo which again created havoc in Denver for connection back to Milwaukee. The absolute kicker is they lost both of our bags going to Cabo (30 hours before returned) and returning to Milwaukee (36 hours before returned). Unbelievable incompetence. Your bags fly free - you just don't know where!,5southwest-airlines,13/03/14,Las Vegas to Richmond VA. Booked with AirTran but transported by Southwest from LAS to ATL. Biggest problem I have with Southwest is no seat assignment. That's why I picked AirTran. With Southwest I feel like I'm treated like cattle and herded through the process of boarding the plane. I believe AirTran has the right approach for boarding. That is 1) assigned seats and 2) boarding by zones. I can't understand why the general flying public tolerates Southwest's cattle call boarding. Southwest's prices are right but their anywhere you want seating is for the birds.,2southwest-airlines,13/03/14,Vacation to Cabo San Lucas Mexico scheduled 3/1/14. Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up. It took another 36 hours to get our bags delivered to our home.,1southwest-airlines,03/03/14,Flew from Nashville-Houston-Dallas last Tuesday. As usual so many people have to bring their suitcases on board with them these days that we leave late. We get to Houston and our connection flight is down they finally get it fixed and we leave out almost an hour late getting into Dallas only to hear they don't know where our luggage is. We later find out that the plane had a lot of freight so they made us wait an hour for our luggage. I live 8 hours (by car) from Dallas and 2 hours from Nashville. Had I driven to Dallas I would have arrived at my hotel 2 hours before I actually got there by flying. On the return trip our flight from Dallas to St. Louis was late and I had to run to my connecting flight to get there before the door was closing. I think this airline is slipping so I intend to start looking at others after always using Southwest without checking.,5southwest-airlines,28/02/14,Flown from Houston to Las Vegas last week. Everything was good (except lots of passengers were drunk and yelling). Our flight departed on time and arrived 15 min prior to schedule. I had no complaints at all for the price it was a fair trip. The return flight was delayed 40 min. Whoever is surprised by this obviously doesn't travel a lot by plane. I say for the price their flights are good don't expect feeling as royalty of course. For short trips (4 hours max.) it's pretty enjoyable.,9southwest-airlines,27/02/14,"Feb 2014 - BUF-FLL (return). We booked Southwest mainly because of the price and I was a little apprehensive about avoiding the dreaded middle and getting a decent aisle seat. We paid an extra fee for their ""early bird"" check in which in our case allowed us to board with the first 25 passengers both outbound and return. It was a 3 hour flight and that's about all of the time I would want to spend in their cramped uncomfortable seating. But for a reasonable short flight I'd book Southwest again. It's a basic no frills airline with no baggage fees and it gets you there albeit not in the most comfortable circumstances.",8southwest-airlines,25/02/14,"15 minutes before scheduled takeoff gate announces delay. 45 minutes later gate announces mechanical problems and further delays.

Also as someone who has flight anxiety I feel so secure when flying Southwest.,10southwest-airlines,10/02/14,I recently flew round trip from Austin to Sacramento. The boarding process went smooth no delays but the flight was very uneventful. The pilot was completely silent the entire flight the flight attendant rude and very cramped seats. The return flight home was overbooked and at 100%. However the pilot and attendants were very pleasant and had a great sense of humor. I would advise that you fill up on food before you fly as there is no meal service just peanuts pretzels and mini Ritz sandwich crackers. It would be nice though if the pilot would make an announcement once in a while regarding your eta.,7southwest-airlines,04/02/14,"We signed up for flight notifications with an email address. We were told at the airport that we had been notified at 11.45 that our flight was cancelled. We had not been notified and neither had anyone else in line around us. Had we been notified we would have known not to leave for our 3 pm flight and not to waste 3 hours going to the airport and standing in line to change our flight. Why were there only 3 customer service people handling the hundreds of people standing in line? Southwest used to be the ""go to"" airline. No longer. What a disappointment.

For internal US travel go for it.,10southwest-airlines,23/01/14,I took this airline from Houston to Orlando and while the flight was smooth I don't really like the seat arrangements.

It was a full flight to a holiday destination at the busiest time of the year. Service was the absolute minimal. Sodas were minimal with just one cup and no top-ups!

They repeatedly lied to us and told us that the Indianapolis airport was closed when there were other airlines flying into Indianapolis from the same airport. They changed our flight 10 times. After they cancelled our flight to Indy they put us on another flight to Louisville airport after we received this confirmation the flight was reinstated but we lost our spot.

The gentleman taking tickets was making jokes and doing a comedy routine once we finally got on board his parting shot was ""sorry for the delay hope you had as much fun as we did"". When we landed the flight attendants got on the PA and said ""finally"" like the passengers were responsible for the delay. Missed our connection to Burbank that flight was delayed as well but they apparently could not wait another 20 minutes or so to get the rest of the passengers on. I told the agent I'm flexible and can fly into any airport in Southern California. She seemed to be put out at having to help any of us.

SW did offer an ""upgrade"" at check in - access to rows A 1-15 - but that would have cost my wife and me an extra $500!

I like the text message updates early in the day that let you know flights may be late. Before I even left LAX I knew my flight home from SFO would be over 1.5 hours late. That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service. And while I was given B51 on the earlier flight to LAX I still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating. Checking in early is key!,10southwest-airlines,04/12/13,I have been on several airlines in my life but Southwest Airlines in my opinion is the worst. The open seating is like a mad zoo. No control people pushing it is the worse possible way I have ever seen to board a plane. Additionally the seats are the smallest and most cramped I've been in. No leg room and a totally miserable experience. I will not fly with them anymore. They have lost me as a customer. However the flight crew is friendly.,1southwest-airlines,29/11/13,I have been a Southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems. Today I was trying to get home for Thanksgiving. I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication.,southwest-airlines,15/11/13,"Great customer service!

Went to gate agent explained I was screwed by United and really wanted to go to Newark he said ""No problem"" switched me to the Newark flight and handed me the ticket. When I asked how much he said ""No charge have a nice flight"".",10southwest-airlines,14/11/13,Delayed 4 hours each way from Philadelphia to California. No explanation whatsoever. They put me on a different flight and my luggage on the original flight and then lost my luggage! I would rather walk than take Southwest.,1southwest-airlines,10/11/13,I fly with Southwest Airlines frequently. In fact I hardly ever fly with any other US carrier. This does not mean that I love the airline merely that by US standards it is not bad. Some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun. This was especially the case on both flights I took on 28 October from San Francisco to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Minneapolis. The crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long Osaka-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight the day before. At times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights I took with them on the 7th of October -- Minneapolis to Phoenix Phoenix to San Francisco. Surly crews with terrible service. Those two flights drained me more than the flight to Hong Kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined. Most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable. Despite the hits and misses I will likely continue flying with Southwest Airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic US carrier.,7southwest-airlines,06/11/13,Flight 3246 from Chicago Midway to Columbus Ohio on 11/4/13. They used to be the cheapest: no longer. They used to have the best service: now they are going to start charging for bags. They used to be on time: I'm sitting 3 hours late in an airport for the 6th time in 4 months!,1southwest-airlines,29/10/13,I flew 10/24 flt 440 FLL to PVD. We actually arrived early! Everyone from baggage check to flight attendants to flight crew were extremely nice. Same way on the trip home on 10/28 flight 3761. Both planes were full but it was organized and ran smoothly. Excellent value (free baggage etc). I would take Southwest again just based on the employee attitudes.,10southwest-airlines,25/10/13,I am so disappointed. I used to rave about Southwest but things have taken a turn for the worse! First flight out at 7am and the plane had 'mechanical issues' so we were delayed. We missed our connecting flight. As we were deplaning the flight staff informed us that they held the Southwest connection for those 31 passengers going to Las Vegas however since there were only 19 of us headed to LAX we had to be rebooked. They proceeded to take us to Fort Lauderdale with an ensuing 7 hour layover and then a delay on the tarmac for another hour! I think the worst part was not once did any Southwest employee acknowledge our inconvenience.,southwest-airlines,23/10/13,Took flight 2009 from Las Vegas 10/33/2013. Told flight was delayed 30 minutes ended up being over an hour and a half. We were waiting on luggage to arrive from another flight. There were approx. 15-20 people trying to make connections in Austin and they were holding the plane for luggage. Usually great flights not this one. Will have to think twice before flying SW again.,2southwest-airlines,15/10/13,My husband for the first time booked three flights with Southwest. We flew from Orlando to New Orleans from New Orleans to Dallas then from Dallas back to Orlando. We were very pleased with the service and we agreed that every seat on a Southwest flight IS compatible to flying first class with any other carrier. They all should take note IJS. You must remember to print your boarding pass 24 hours prior to your flight departure this will determine your boarding zone. The check in was so smooth! No need to fly with any other carrier.,10southwest-airlines,07/10/13,Yesterday 10/6/2013 my husband and I traveled on flight #320 from Phoenix to SF and although the trip was smooth and uneventful we were disappointed that throughout the entire flight (except the last few minutes for landing) the lights in the cabin were dimmed a bit but were never turned completely off. I can only speak for the two of us but I found it very annoying and not relaxing at all. It turned our two hour flight (that I was looking forward to closing my eyes and relaxing) to one in which I was looking at my watch frequently anxious for the flight to end. Disappointing for sure!,1southwest-airlines,07/10/13,I flew Southwest today for the first time. Flight 905 LGA to Chicago Midway. Easy check in online pre-queue at the airport. Seats are comfortable with decent legroom clean and new aircraft professional cabin crew. Left 5 min late due ramp congestion but arrived in Midway 20 min earlier. Will fly with them again and certainly would recommend.,10southwest-airlines,03/10/13,Birmingham AL to Orlando FL on Oct. 2 2013. Flight number 243. Southwest has fallen into the cattle service crowd. Not only nothing special here their cute casual personality now falls short and is boring. Non service oriented on the plane and even worse in re-shuffling flight schedules for maximum load making paying customers wait in airports because their original flight get canceled. A value no longer all the best I'm flying with someone who cares about my loyalty.,southwest-airlines,01/10/13,Three recent trips on Southwest (AUS-DEN DEN-SMF SFO-PHX). All three were delayed with times ranging from an acceptable 20 mins to a nail biting 75 mins delay which meant we almost missed our connecting flight. Gate agents were all friendly and kept us informed. On board was a different matter with rarely a smile from the flight attendants. Southwest used to be so different from the competition but I don't think this is the case anymore. Free checked bags is certainly an advantage though.,5southwest-airlines,19/09/13,This was our first time with Southwest round-trip from DEN-LAX both flights left and arrived on time. There were no problems or delays with boarding. Check-in and baggage check-in very efficient. This was wonderful considering that we have often flown United USAir American Delta and not once did the plane leave on time and had problems with loading. The crew were polite and courteous unlike those other US airlines we have flown.,9southwest-airlines,15/09/13,I recently flew to New York City and my airport was LaGuardia. The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful. I don't think I will take SW to New York especially via LaGuardia ever again.,3southwest-airlines,15/09/13,SFO-LAS. First time flying Southwest! The crew were hilarious. Great quick flight - left and arrived on time boarding was quick and efficient and the baggage arrived quickly. Loved this airline and would happily fly them as my carrier of choice for my next trip to America.,10southwest-airlines,10/09/13,From Vegas back to San Francisco. In Group B I was one of the first people to board the plane. When I heard my group being called I stood in line in the right number section that was written on my boarding pass. Following the people in line in front of me I presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way I never want to fly Southwest again. As I presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. Instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. She instead grumbled this isn't your group. Please wait to board when I call your group. Confused I replied is this group B?â€ù She stared at the pass for a while and responded â€œOh I thought I called the wrong group!â€ù And finally let me board. This frustrated me as the attendant didn't make eye contact with me the whole time we were talking. The captain and crew members were unprofessional and laughed many times over the main speaker when making announcements. My flight was on Sunday around 10.30am departing from Vegas. Not such a great way to end my vacation.,2southwest-airlines,05/09/13,I'm Executive Platinum with AA and as we live in Austin AA is usually our carrier of choice. Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche.,10southwest-airlines,04/09/13,"Had the displeasure of flying Flight 2878 (9/2/2013) last night from Dallas to St. Louis. Flight was supposed to depart at 7.05pm but we were in the plane on the ground at 7.25pm when I got a voice mail message from Southwest Airlines to tell me that the flight would leave at 7.25pm. Flight taxied out at 7.35pm and got in position to take off when the flight crew declared a ""Medical Emergency"" and returned to the terminal where we sat until 8.05pm. Finally took off and landed in St. Louis at 9.30pm - 50 minutes late. Sunday night flights to St. Louis are repeatedly late.",2southwest-airlines,04/09/13,Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A. Either way it is best to avoid Southwest Airlines at all costs.,2southwest-airlines,02/09/13,Horrible experience coming home from Disneyworld in Orlando on Saturday August 31. The Southwest flight from Orlando to Chicago missed the connecting flight to Philadelphia by about 10 minutes. We were put on standby for the next flight to Philadelphia 4 hours later but they did not have 4 tickets for my family for that flight (but they sent our checked-in luggage back to Philadelphia on that flight). We were then told at the MDW Southwest desk that there was no flight to Philadelphia for another 3 days but that Southwest was not offering us any overnight lodging or meal vouchers. We were incredulous. At least a dozen other Philadelphians were stranded. We finally took city transit to Union Station and grabbed an Amtrak to NYC then were back home in Philadelphia Sunday night.,1southwest-airlines,27/08/13,I have traveled Southwest for years. Always good service and friendly flight attendants. Recently I flew from Omaha to Las Vegas. I arrived at McCarran Airport at approximately 12.10pm. I had to get to my shuttle location by 12.30pm otherwise I would have to wait until 2pm to catch the next shuttle. I didn't think that there was anyway I could catch the 12.30pm shuttle because of the time to get the baggage off the plane. To my complete amazement the luggage arrived very quickly and I was able to get to the shuttle that left at 12.30pm.,10southwest-airlines,27/08/13,I've flown 12 separate flights on Southwest over the last 5 months and I have always found the flights to be pleasant. The line-up seating encourages passengers to interact and the crew have always been friendly and helpful. The on-board wi-fi for $8/day was well worth the expense and can be off-set by the fact that there is no charge for up to two 50 lb bags! Granted there is no 5-star service but Southwest provides an enjoyable experience for a great price.,10southwest-airlines,27/08/13,Another pleasant set of flights on Southwest. BUF-LAS 737-700 LAS-BUF 737-800 (Sky interior with larger overhead bins). Got the seats with double leg room on both flights even with an A30/A37 boarding number. Glad I paid for Early-bird check-in. ($12.50 US each way). Bag drop a bit slow in BUF - can't understand why they don't have a dedicated bag drop line. All flights on time. Drink/snack service on all legs with an additional water service on the longer legs. Luggage delivered quickly at LAS and BUF. Already planning my next trip on Southwest.,9southwest-airlines,22/08/13,Definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare! However if you are traveling alone and can check in at least a week early and are comfortable with pushing shoving and being rude then maybe this airline is for you.,southwest-airlines,15/08/13,OAK - HOU round trip 73Fs both ways and I was in Seat 5F going and 4F on the return. Evolve Interior not bad and my only complaint is a lack of power ports. Cute cookies. Staff not at all bad. Only real complaint was that outbound flight was delayed but they made up for the delay in the air so even though I literally ran through HOU I did pick up my rental car before they closed for the day.,7southwest-airlines,14/08/13,"They did not hold my plane for my connecting flight. I asked the flight attendant to whisk me to the front of the plane so I could make a run for it and he said ""they'll hold the plane for you. I've worked here for 25 years and we've never just left someone behind."" Well after waiting for 100 people to deplane I made a run for it and got to the gate just as the plane was pulling away.",southwest-airlines,11/08/13,Had a flight from MD to FL the most unorganized flight I have ever been on. It is as if they have never had a flight before! Yes it was that bad! I have been using this company for years and after this experience I will never use them again! It was simply chaos. Avoid at all cost!,southwest-airlines,08/08/13,August 2013 DEN-OMA-DEN. Travelled to Omaha for business trip. Plane about 80% full both flights. First time in a long time-actually can't remember when-both flights arrived on time. FAs very pleasant and helpful really nothing to criticize; would recommend based on punctuality alone.,10southwest-airlines,08/08/13,LAX-DEN-MKE-LAX. All flights worked a treat except a delay out of Denver due to fog of all things - and Denver sits at 5000 feet! Paid for early check-in and was in low A group every time. Once you understand their system and its quite logical SW is a great airline to fly with.,10southwest-airlines,01/08/13,HOU-LGA-HOU on 737-300 both ways. Boarding was chaotic; cattle herding people onto the plane was very unusual and not efficient. Seats and aircraft were outdated. Seats were very uncomfortable and gave me little legroom. I found myself having to move around in my seat every 30 seconds. Flight attendants were slow to respond. Inflight entertainment was a SkyMall magazine free viewing of the news networks (FOX ABC etc.) free flight tracking software and slow overpriced wifi for 8 USD. Turbulence was awful coming into LGA. Only good thing about was that you get 2 bags free.,2southwest-airlines,24/07/13,"July 23 flight 2528. Very poor customer service from flight attendant. I realize its been a long day for them but when customer service is 90% of your job the expectation is that you bite your younger when passengers are upset about unexpected plane changes. Her condescending ""Hun"" is unacceptable.",2southwest-airlines,24/07/13,"My plane landed at 6pm today. I wasn't even suppose to leave the plane just board more passengers then off to Flint. Well we all had to unload and wait for them to find another pilot. For an hour were held due to weather issues. Then they decided the pilot would be with us at 9pm this was delayed until 945. So we load get ready to leave at 10.15 and then there was a ""mechanical issue"" that had to be checked. 30 mins later we finally got ready to take off. Then the pilot comes over the PA to tell us we were going back to the gate. So 11.00 at night and were waiting for them to find another pilot. Moral of the story. Save yourself time and money and don't fly Southwest.",southwest-airlines,24/07/13,I flew from Albany NY to Oakland CA to get married. When the crew found out I was getting married I was presented with a bottle of Korbel champagne! What a lovely gesture from an airline that puts service first.,10southwest-airlines,21/07/13,Southwest is not the on time airline it used to be. I was on a flight from Salt Lake City to Phoenix in march and it was delayed 5 hours. Then my children were flying from Phoenix to Providence as unaccompanied minors in June and they were on the plane and it had an issue so they had to deplane and find another airplane. They arrived 3 hours late and one hour before my husband who was also flying into Providence whose plane was delayed coming from Tampa. So the grandfather had to drive to the airport at 12.30 am to get the kids as they were unaccompanied minors. Now I am on a plane headed to Boston and it is delayed by two hours taking away they night I had planned in the city. I have been a loyal SWA customer but no more.,2southwest-airlines,10/07/13,Non-stop from Rochester to Orlando. Friendly crew. We traveled with our two children one being a toddler. The staff were friendly and courteous and checked on us several times. We didn't have any delays except on return and it was only ten minutes. I would definitely fly Southwest again!,10southwest-airlines,10/07/13,Great flight. Flew from TPA-MDW non-stop. Nothing bad on the whole flight. Had a slight delay because there was a passenger who could not find his seat. Flight had an early arrival. Would fly again.,10southwest-airlines,08/07/13,I fly every other week and have been a loyal SW customer for years. I have however noticed that more and more recently over the past year that my flights are delayed. I'm not sure if its an issue that arose from the AirTran acquisition or just their rapid expansion and growth but something is definitely amiss. More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively. I have found that the best way to avoid said delays is taking one of the first few flights of the day avoiding delays that seem not to stem from weather/mechanical issues but rather confusion that just seems to pick up steam throughout the day. If you don't like to wake up early bring a good book!,6southwest-airlines,08/07/13,Nashville-New Orleans on July 1st. Slightly delayed due to weather where the incoming plan left from but after that it was good. Free soft drink snack and checked bag can't believe Ryanair are based on Southwest worlds apart.,9southwest-airlines,03/07/13,This is one of the worst customer care I have seen I booked my a flight for my children (12 and 9) as junior travelers because SWA had told me they would allow my sister to pick them up at the gate and they do not need someone there through out the flight. Flight delayed an hour and did not allow my sister to the gate. SWA personnel told her they would bring back the kids. However when my sister saw the woman (without the kids) her answer was they did not pay the fee. SWA left them to sort it out on their own at 2am at Boston airport!,southwest-airlines,21/06/13,I am from Tucson and live in San Diego. I make about 3 trips per year back to Tucson and usually drive every time. I decided to try flying to save time. The car picked me up at 6.55pm on 6/12 for flight 499 from SAN to TUS (9.05 flight time). I waited in the Airport for 2 hours until we finally boarded at 9.15pm sat on runway for 20 minutes and finally took off at 9.42pm. Again the flight was supposed to take off at 9.05pm. Crew were unapologetic and slow moving. We didn't land until 10.50pm. On the way back to San Diego on flight 1858 we were supposed to leave at 9.30am. It is 9.39am now and the estimated departure is now 10.15am. I have heard no updates from staff. No announcements. I will never fly Southwest again.,southwest-airlines,19/06/13,My flight to Chicago from Ft. Lauderdale via St. Louis 5/12-13/2013 was interrupted by extremely bad weather in Chicago at MDW. Southwest staff were very involved in getting myself and all the other passengers on Flt 352 to our destination. I did arrive late but did indeed arrive and so did my luggage.,10southwest-airlines,19/06/13,23-27 May 2013 Columbus OH - CMH to Ft. Lauderdale FL - FLL. Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes. Southwest gave us a credit for the trouble without us asking.,10southwest-airlines,12/06/13,I had a connection in ATL on my way to BWI after taxiing out we went back to the gate with mechanical issues. The de-icer warning light came on. They told us we would have to wait for the plane to be fixed as there were no available planes after de-boarding they said they had found another plane for us. It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best. The crew etc were fine no issues there. The only thing I can say and it might be too critical is I would have expected them to be more proactive about reimbursing for the inconvenience.,8southwest-airlines,10/06/13,CLE-MCI with a stopover at MDW. The flight crew were attentive and nice and the plane a Boeing 737-700 was very clean.,10southwest-airlines,28/05/13,I will never fly Southwest again even though they were $300 cheaper than the opposition. I have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that I have had with SWA in the last 2 days! The weather has been good! If you want to save money and don't care about things like arriving/departing on time they aren't that bad. Also I am not a fan of the royal rumble/every man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight. I sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filled-to the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop. Putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasn't a blast either. All in all the savings in my opinion does not warrant the lack of professional services that should be granted from an airline.,3southwest-airlines,27/05/13,"LAX-LAS-DEN flight delayed due to mechanical problems. After a 2 hr delay gate agent announced we would receive $100 vouchers off future travel. We couldn't re-book on the next flight as it was full. Unfortunately problem was not fixed and flight was canceled 4 hrs after scheduled departure. We were re-booked and arrived 6 hours late. While I understand mechanical issues happen such a long delay is unacceptable on a short 1 hr flight such as LAX-LAS. Southwest should have been able to swap out an aircraft at a major hub such as LAX. Prompt re-booking when the problem was first discovered could have got passengers to their destinations sooner. Otherwise cabin was clean and In-flight service good featuring pretzels peanuts and complimentary soft drinks. The new ""Evolve"" seating is uncomfortable and cramped with 31"" pitch. Admittedly such a lengthy delay is not customary for Southwest but their overall punctuality and cabin comfort has deteriorated in the past few years.",1southwest-airlines,27/05/13,I'm consistency taking Southwest out of Midway to a variety of different places (LAX PHX ABQ DEN HOU LAS) and its usually the redeye. I can always judge the best and worst of airlines based on their customer service during their redeye hours. Airlines staff have always been friendly and accommodating. My partner for example was feeling ill after a trip and he was granted an early boarding pass after explaining his situation to the boarding crew. You also can't beat two free bags and no change fees; I was able to use the funds from a canceled flight towards another. Rewards program is pretty good too especially if you have a Southwest card.,10southwest-airlines,27/05/13,LAS-SEA first time flying Southwest my whole experience should be described as a visit to the zoo you line to the check in kiosks at airport where you print your boarding pass and insert the bags into the system then line again to see the agent with your tags the funny part is yet to come! Boarding process as someone here said is a cattle car thing they board by groups and family traveling together in different groups start scenes on the gate it delays everything. Onboard crew not well groomed I had the impression they hated being there. The more I fly American legacy carriers the more I stop complaining about Brazilian airlines.,5southwest-airlines,21/05/13,I fly Southwest a lot even though I don't like their cattle car boarding procedure. My latest problem with them is their customer service or lack of. I had a flight scheduled from Little Rock to Houston which was delayed 50 minutes so would miss my connection in Houston. Called to reschedule for the next day and was told I would have to pay an extra $170 for changing my flight. They offered no help and insisted I would have to pay the upgrade fee even though they had plenty of seats on flights the next day. If the flight had been delayed an hour instead of 50 minutes they would've changed my flight free!,southwest-airlines,20/05/13,Badly handled 3-hour delay CMH to DEN flight. This is the first time in my history with Southwest so I don't know who to blame for the misinformation lack of information and lack of concern from the CMH ground personnel. Obviously my unfailing praise for Southwest has been tempered. I hope they do some personnel training so future passengers are treated better. Date of this was 5/20/13.,4southwest-airlines,20/05/13,Southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience I ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering I am on a flight 3-4 days a week. This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. There hasn't been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or ETA is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery.,southwest-airlines,15/05/13,RNO-ONT-RNO. All flights on time if not a little early. Staff pleasant ground crew pleasant. Made a brief stop in Vegas on the way to Ontario and a brief stop in Oakland on the way back. Very quick turn around times. Full flights on all sectors and staff even managed to do a quick beverage service on a 35 minute flight. Southwest has a good product and I will continue to be a pleased customer.,10southwest-airlines,13/05/13,Take Southwest weekly from Portland OR to Las Vegas. Flights in the morning have been on time. Late night returns have run from 45 mins to 2 hours delayed. Flight crews are excellent and professional. 4 non-stops between Portland and Las Vegas during the work week 2 bags checked bags free and no change fees keep me a loyal customer. Besides the later return flights and Southwest frequent schedule changes I have nothing but praise for this airline.,10southwest-airlines,08/05/13,Columbus ticket counter was rude and condescending. Flight was delayed getting to Chicago. On leg from Chicago to PDX our previous flight delay made us the last to enter the plane. We were traveling with a 6 week old baby and a 4 year old. The flight crew did not try to help us by asking people to move seats so we were separated for the flight. It was a terrible experience. It has been a while since we flew SW but I can say that we will avoid this airline as much as possible.,southwest-airlines,08/05/13,Excellent fare! I flew round-trip from DAL (Dallas Love Field) to SEA (Seattle) for $228. round-trip. All flights arrived within 10 minutes of scheduled times. The flights in both directions stopped in Albuquerque. Inflight service was consistent. We had crew changes in ABQ in both directions. Although all crews were fine some were better than others.,9southwest-airlines,21/04/13,We had an issue with our tickets and time our flight was to leave Indy Southwest had cancelled our original flight but had not notified us that our flight was leaving at 6.45 vs 8.10 therefore we missed our flight. The Southwest staff at Indy were very apologetic and helpful they placed on the next flight out which was a direct flight bought us breakfast and gave us vouchers to use in the future. Flight crew on this flight were excellent!,10southwest-airlines,16/04/13,Horrible experience we sat in the plane for an hour only to realize that the flight was cancelled because a small plastic emergency sign would not illuminate! I suspect there was more to it than that because the plane was empty on around 20 people on board. Everyone on board suspected that they cancelled this flight because it was empty. There were no more flights out that night and we had to be in Phoenix by 7:30 am for a competition. So after getting the cold shoulder from the front desk and a voucher that she was to lazy to put in my name and she couldn't refund our flight! (we had to do that the next day). We drove all night to make the competition the next morning.,southwest-airlines,16/04/13,I have taken several flights recently from Denver to Burbank CA. Each time we left on time and usually arrival ahead of time. The Early Bird Check-in is well worth the few dollars. Having two free bags to check-in enabled me to avoid the part I usually dread - hoisting the bag into the overhead locker. The customer service was great! The other thing I really appreciate is having porters at the airport to check in the bags.,10southwest-airlines,03/04/13,Five flights over the last two weeks Islip to BWI to ATL to MDW to LAX then San Diego to Oakland all left and arrived on time effortless check in. Comfortable seats and reasonable leg room. All in all an experience that beats all other US domestic carriers. I have platinum elite status with another carrier here but for domestic flights Southwest beat them hands down.,10southwest-airlines,02/04/13,The prices are great and the staff on the airplane are always friendly. The staff on the ground/at the gate are always less than desirable. My husband and I have flown Southwest 3 times in the last year from Baltimore and all 3 times I have a seat but he is on Standby. They overbook flights all the time and then act like they're doing me a favor by finding someone else to take a later flight. I paid for my ticket(s) at least 2-3 months in advance. The customer service is absolutely awful at BWI. Never again.,2southwest-airlines,26/03/13,Last Monday (3/18/13) flight 1990 from SNA to SJC was 20 minutes late and this raised the possibility that the plane would not be able to take off before the 10pm airport curfew. The gate agent repeatedly motivated us to expedite our boarding. The flight took off before the curfew and the cabin crew provided their usual friendly service during flight. We arrived at SJC only 10 minutes behind schedule despite the late departure. For non-stop flights this airline remains my top choice for domestic flights.,9southwest-airlines,25/03/13,Took two flights with Southwest during March - New Orleans to Nashville and Nashville to Newark. We were delayed a few hours on the Nashville-Newark trip due to bad weather but were kept informed at all times and we were impressed by the good humour and personalities of the flight and cabin crew. Definitely worthwhile checking in online 24 hours prior to flight as you can get a good position in the queue for boarding. Overall a great budget option comparable to our home grown equivalent Virgin Australia. We were rewarded with a $100 travel voucher for the delay from Nashville also - much appreciated. Would definitely recommend Southwest.,9southwest-airlines,25/03/13,We flew from MSP into Las Vegas and had a great flight. Staff at the check in gate were friendly and had a sense of humor! Staff aboard plane were helpful and had a smile! A pleasant change from many airlines we have flown on. The fact that there is no extra baggage fee free snack and free beverage just added to the enjoyment of the flight. Our plane out of Las Vegas was delayed and the connecting flight in Denver actually waited for us! We'll book again.,10southwest-airlines,19/03/13,BUF-MSP-BUF (Feb 28/Mar 8). Excellent value for money and definitely a winning proposition hands down when compared to flying from Pearson (YYZ). Both legs arrived before time. Efficient operation with crew (both apt and air) always on the ball with updates. On the return leg they scheduled a Boeing 737-900 (bright and with lots of overhead cabin space) to accommodate the additional load due to storm cancellation the day before. BUF and MDW do not have the best options for food but you can always find something ok. Don't count on much for breakfast at MSP if flying out early.,10southwest-airlines,19/03/13,Traveling from MCO to BDL plane had a mechanical problem at MCO and we were forced into a delay of 4 hours. They gave every passenger a $200 voucher for the inconvenience. As usual fantastic crew and even provided us with free cocktails.,10southwest-airlines,12/03/13,March 8th our air travel with another carrier completely fell through (weather related issues). We went to the Southwest ticket counter to see if there was any possibility they could help us. Several different options were given even though we had a tight schedule and were looking to leave ASAP! Once aboard the flight the bins had great room (although some people really do push the size of their carry-on to ridiculous proportions). Seats were comfortable (even for my husband who has a bad leg) snacks were good and the inflight crew were great!,10southwest-airlines,06/03/13,CMH-MDW-LGA return. Definitely a value airline when the tickets are purchased well in advance at a cheap price. Southwest offers up to 2 free baggage check-ins and that definitely beats most other airlines who charge extra for checked-in baggage. You get a free drink and peanuts/pretzels so cannot complain. The real negative thing about WN may be its inability to accrue miles on major mileage systems. They have their own system but the benefits are quite limited even when you become the A-list. Another downside of WN may be its tight operation of aircraft's. As they operate on such a tight schedule one delay could trigger something like a domino effect. My final concern is about the seating order as somehow more and more people seems to be getting priority status so even a web check-in well in advance will barely get you in the A section. As a matter of fact I have been hearing that even with Early Bird Check-in purchase the seating order may turn out to be worse than you expected. Definitely something WN may have to work on.,8southwest-airlines,27/02/13,Our flight from San Jose to Phoenix was cancelled because the Portland flight had a light bulb go out and they took the plane that was designated for Phoenix. We had paid for early bird seating and had numbers A31 & 32 but were given numbers B21 & 22 and had to sit in the middle seats. It was a miserable flight!,3southwest-airlines,22/02/13,"Got stuck in Kansas City last night due to the storm and was the only flight out before Friday so I jumped on. Well even with the new seating line-up and a B assignment so I was able to snag an aisle seat it still was pretty unpleasant. Plane was full ran out of overhead bins people were grumpy seats seemed really tight and just overall was not a very good experience. I was willing to pay extra for ""business class"" but they were already taken. I might be in the minority however I will gladly pay a little more for an assigned seat plenty of overhead and a slightly less full flight on some of the other carriers that I fly on a weekly basis. This is not an airline for business travelers. Hopefully I won't be seeing myself on a SouthWest flight anytime soon.",5southwest-airlines,13/02/13,"Several flights over the last couple of months the most recent which was DAL-STL-BWI-LIT-DAL. Online check-in and bag check has been painless crews have been friendly and occasionally even entertaining and all flights have either been on-time if not a little early. Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights. Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point. Also on the most recent DAL-STL leg I got stuck with a B boarding pass despite paying for EarlyBird. Otherwise no real problems at all.",9southwest-airlines,04/02/13,Flew round-trip St Louis to Omaha. Both flights left on time and arrived even a little early. FAs were friendly and smiled. I checked in online 24 hours before and got a good boarding number both times. The planes were clean and the leather seats were comfortable. All in all Southwest is a good product.,10southwest-airlines,23/01/13,"I question Southwest Airline's Earlybird Check-in. Today's flight from Ft. Myers Florida to Philadelphia PA Flight 1431. I had booked and purchased ""Earlybird"" check-in back on 8/22/12. I was given Boarding Pass #B- 4. I sat next to someone who did not have ""Earlybird Check-in and checked-in hours before the flight and was given Boarding Pass A-36. This is not the first time this has happened to me.",7southwest-airlines,10/01/13,SJC (San Jose CA) to SNA (Orange County CA) on Dec 31 2012 return Jan 2 2013. Both flights within 15 minutes of scheduled departure time. Orderly boarding gate agents professionally enforcing the Aâ€“Bâ€“C boarding-group sequence. Power outlets at the SNA gates seating areas! On-line check-in exactly 24 hours before both flights gave me an 'A' boarding group on both flights. Pilots and Flight Attendants announcements were a nice mix of professional and funny. Both flights were brief (less than 60 minutes in the air) but FA's still managed to give us a free drink and a peanut/pretzel snack. Two suitcases flew for free. To top things off these flights were by far the most economical option for this round-trip trek. For domestic direct flights Southwest continues to be my preferred carrier.,10southwest-airlines,07/01/13,Dec 20 2012 Oakland to Los Angeles. Plane returned after 30 minutes in flight to departure airport due to a landing gear problem. When we got back to Oakland told 'this plane is going nowhere'. In 20 minutes we were placed in another plane. 35 minutes on and we had to return to Oakland. Returned to Oakland. I arrived to LA on a third plane missed my international flight and have to pay $414 US dollars to fly 2 days after my planned departure date. Give. a $100 voucher.,southwest-airlines,02/01/13,Flying home for the holidays Southwest cancelled my flight then offered to book me four days later. I had to book my own flight on a different airline to get in before the holidays. Southwest never notified me that my flight was cancelled? On the way back we were delayed 4 hours when Southwest decided to re-route our plane to another city. No explanation. The pilot actually made an announcement to clarify that it wasn't his fault.,southwest-airlines,04/12/12,Recently flew from Dallas Love Field to Louisville Ky with multiple stops round-trip. All flights were on time with consistent inflight service. The boarding process was fair and orderly. I had an A boarding number on both flights while checking in exactly 24 hours before departure.,10southwest-airlines,22/11/12,Reno - Vegas - Reno. As usual all went well and we were informed of any delays which were only 15 minutes or so. Good service on both flights. Crew were genuine and helpful. Ground staff pleasant and you still can't beat the two free checked bags. Southwest has a good product and will continue to get my business.,10southwest-airlines,21/11/12,"Flew from Albany NY to LAX via Chicago MDW and returned a week later. On time flights good service pleasant crews and no baggage problems on any of the 4 flights. Most of the cabin crews showed a refreshing sense of humor. Nice airline to fly. Flew ""Business Select"".",10southwest-airlines,08/11/12,My latest roundtrip from SJC-PHX-SJC was as usual excellent. Flights left on time and arrived early. Customer service on the ground and onboard was excellent with pleasant staff. Checked in bags free for the first two on this airline arrived intact and quickly. A superb experience when compared with the so-called full service domestic carriers within the US.,10southwest-airlines,08/11/12,ORF-MDW. 737-700 was clean and nice. Snacks served the seats were comfortable leather and FA's were attentive and helpful. Departed and landed on time. Only complaint: With the open seating my mother and I were put in boarding group B31-60 and couldn't sit together.,9southwest-airlines,05/11/12,My husband and I flew from Las Vegas to Baltimore return. The seats are small and extremely uncomfortable no elbow room. The seat cushions were thin and caused tail bone pain. We will never fly Southwest again for a flight longer than 1.5 hours. Clearly passenger comfort even on a flight of almost 5 hours is not a priority to Southwest.,southwest-airlines,03/11/12,Flew non-stop from Hartford to Las Vegas and back. Flights were delayed and overbooked. No meal service available food consisted of an assortment of mini ritz peanuts etc. Beverage menu was good.,2southwest-airlines,01/11/12,RNO-DEN-RNO. All went well. On time except for return flight in which they held the plane 15 minutes for some connecting passengers that were on their way. We were kept informed. Crew were pleasant on all flights. The captain stood by the exit and said his thank you as we all exited. Baggage arrived safely except mine was covered in snow in Denver.,10southwest-airlines,29/10/12,BWI-DFW-BWI in Big Front Seats. Had misgivings about flying Spirit but decided to give them a chance due to perfect non-stop flight schedule for my meetings and cost savings (Spirit was half the price even after paying extra fees to carry-on bag and Big Front Seat equivalent to a standard US domestic first class seat). Pleasantly surprised: reasonably orderly boarding experience new airplane clean cabin professional crew and on-time flights both ways. Would fly them again.,9southwest-airlines,29/10/12,Concerns my wife who flew from Minneapolis with a connecting flight in St. Louis. Final destination Kansas City. Plane left Mpls on time arrived in St. Louis 30 minutes late but were assured connecting flights would hold. Upon arrival the flight left for St. Louis about 10 minutes before the arrival of my wife's flight. There were 18 people on the Mpls flight headed for KC. So presumably the flight to KC had 18 empty seats. Next flight left approximately two hours later. Upon arrival in St. Louis there was no one at the desk they had to hunt down an SW employee to find out what was going on.,southwest-airlines,29/10/12,San Diego to San Francisco. Just how a budget airline should operate. No frills but easy check in comfortable seats clean plane on time departure and a sensible boarding system. Never used before but very impressed and all for just $50.,10southwest-airlines,23/10/12,Connecting flight from Indianapolis to Austin. No choice but to fly. Got to Dallas and have been stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours and counting. I could have driven from Dallas to Austin. The car is faster less hassle and more reliable for these trips. I have to travel back to Dallas tomorrow and you can bet it will be on 4 wheels!,6southwest-airlines,22/10/12,San Jose CA [SJC] to Seattle WA [SEA] on 10/10/12 returning on 10/14/12. Flight time is only 1:45 and maybe this is why I didn't mind having no video or audio entertainment there was WiFi access available for purchase. First time dealing with their reservations system via phone and the process of re-booking was quick clear and painless. Flights were on time cabin crew friendly and efficient soft drink peanuts and cheese crackers were free and my checked bag was free. I look forward to flying with them again for the holidays in December.,10southwest-airlines,16/09/12,"Most recently I flew round trip from Bradley in Hartford CT to BWI. Southwest is definitely a mixed bag. I guess if you have a small barking dog it's great for you. Unfortunately if you are stuck on the plane in the vicinity of this yapping dog which yapped incessantly for the entire flight it's not so great. If you were lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket that's wonderful but if you end up with ""C"" like I did that means you are forced to fend for yourself to try and find space in the overstuffed overhead bins. Since I don't check baggage and can never seem to be lucky enough to get an ""A"" ticket I'll only fly Southwest out of sheer necessity. It's always a free-for-all stampede of confusion-in this case the flight was overbooked so you've got people milling about unsure what's up. The space for standing in line for the flight is ludicrous since the line is largely ignored by most-like standing in line at the movie theatre for tickets-all of a sudden people just happen to show up to join their party and cut in front of you without an excuse me or any kind of courtesy whatsoever. Flying on Southwest is like getting on a bus-no assigned seats. You definitely feel like part of the herd only difference is you do get a couple of packages of peanuts and a cold drink from a smiling flight attendant.",4southwest-airlines,16/09/12,I travel from the Washington area to Denver several times a year. Previously I used United but I am increasingly using Southwest. The flights are cheaper and the quality of service is higher. My only complaint about Southwest is that the seat could have used a little more padding. I realize delays due to weather or other problems occur but United lies about the cause.,9southwest-airlines,16/09/12,"Flew round-trip SJC-LAS-SJC outbound on Sep 11 (flight 328) returning on Sep 14 (flight 259). The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne. I still recommend SWA to my friends and relatives for short non-stop trips.",8southwest-airlines,10/09/12,LAX-OAK on a 737-300. Even though the flight was under an hour they gave us a free soft drink as well as a snack. Flight attendants good. Got good value for money flights very cheap and bags were free.,10southwest-airlines,10/09/12,Flew SW from Denver to Philadelphia on 7 September. Flight was delayed by an hour due to weather in the Philadelphia area but we were kept informed of changes which was good. Boarding was nowhere near as stressful as I imagined (compared to the UK low cost carriers) and managed to get a window seat. Seats are very comfortable with adequate legroom certainly as much as any other airline in economy. Crew were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight. Free soft drinks and as many snacks as you wanted were given out though no IFE. This flight had WI-FI which was good. Overall a pretty good flight which I would happily do again.,10southwest-airlines,06/09/12,I flew with them last month between Las Vegas and Orange County. I have to say for a budget airline they include hold bags in their ticket price a free non-alcoholic beverage and a bag of peanuts that's more our European equivalents offer. A very comfortable leather seat with generous leg room and nice flight attendants. Checking in at the airport without my confirmation number to hand was easier than I first thought. The check in agent picked up on the fact I was not a non U.S citizen and checked us in.,10southwest-airlines,06/09/12,I flew from Boston to Baltimore on Aug 28 aboard a 737-700. Great experience all around. All staff friendly and helpful. Plane was clean seats in good shape. Very comfortable seats. All pax had arrived at the gate early so we boarded and pushed back almost 15 minutes early so of course we arrived early. Short easy flight but they still offered complementary peanuts and soda water or juice. This plane was Row 44 WiFi equipped so it was available for $5. I didn't try it because it was just a 55 minute flight. I had a great experience with Southwest no hesitation to fly them again.,10southwest-airlines,03/09/12,ORF-CLE with a stopover at Chicago Midway. On the first leg of the journey it was a Boeing 737-700 and the flight attendants were fun to be around. Leather seats were nice and comfy and the drinks were good. They even gave out complimentary bags of peanuts which most airlines don't do any more. On the flight to Cleveland it was a 737-300 which was older but nice we got peanuts again.,10southwest-airlines,03/09/12,I have been on 6 flights in two days and all flights have been top notch. Take off on time arrive early. Boarding fast and hassle free. The gate staff are nice as are flight crew. I am really impressed and highly recommend SWA.,10southwest-airlines,19/08/12,LAX-MDW-IAD-TUC-LAX. First the bad - 4 hour delay at Midway and only found out about it after peering into gate agents screen. Line-up by numbers worked well and even with a C 10 we managed to get a window seat (at the back). Snacks quite good and booze cheap. On the 4 hour delay flight (to IAD) there were only around 20 of us left and FA's did their level best to help us all out and make us comfortable. I think they were on the 12th hour of a long day. Better than most US domestics in my opinion.,9southwest-airlines,16/08/12,"ONT-OAK and later SMF-ONT. For the first flight we booked a 2-3 weeks in advance (unfortunately just as fares jumped as seemed to occur every few days) and paid the $10 ""Early Bird"" fee but still had numbers in the low 40s. So no chance of bulkhead or emergency row. Did better on the second flight and managed to get first row bulkhead seats. Free drinks but only a cup (you don't get the can). Flights were pretty much on time.",7southwest-airlines,14/08/12,"My family and I were given apparent ""seat numbers"" on our tickets which actually just mean the order in which you line up at the gate and the seating was actually open (and poorly organized I might add). I did not purchase the tickets personally and did not know about the open seating policy so I thought someone was in my seat and told a flight attendant about it. She stared at me like I was crazy. It took me quite a while to find a seat on the plane and neither my wife nor myself could sit with our very young daughter in the end. Before the return flight my wife had to get something out of her luggage so we asked an employee if she could get it for her. The woman rolled her eyes at us and scoffed before calling someone to get our luggage. The problem with this airline didn't end there. We waited an hour at baggage claim before they finally started loading bags onto the carousels. Fly with Southwest if you like inefficiency.",1southwest-airlines,08/08/12,Poor customer service. Daughters first solo flight a disaster. San Diego to Denver to Pittsburgh (no plane change just a stop in Denver). Got to Denver early then delays left hour and 20 minutes late. Get to Pittsburgh not only did her luggage not make it but neither did some other passengers. Filed report. They said they'd call when luggage found no phone call from them. Went to San Diego airport (40 minute trip one way plus parking for a second time) to see if luggage here. No luck.,2southwest-airlines,01/08/12,MCO-PHL return. Flight to PHL was only 15 minutes late leaving after posting a two-hour delay. The return left on time. Two free checked bags a cup of soda and snacks plus overhead comedy via funny flight attendants. My only qualm is the boarding; had A positions but on the flight to Orlando a large group (who were holding C) blocked the path to the gate and wouldn't move and the gate agent just let us walk around them instead of asking them to move. As the gate area was crowded this cause some problems getting to the check-in desk. But overall not bad.,8southwest-airlines,26/07/12,"Flew between Denver and Salt Lake City. Crew were funny and helpful telling jokes during most public announcements. Plane arrived on time and was much cheaper as an option than other airlines. The only criticism I had was you must have your booking reference to hand if you go to the desk for check in as they don't appear to have it ""in the system"" if you just give them your name but this may have changed.",9southwest-airlines,25/07/12,We can all agree the airline industry is at an all time low. My experience with SWA yesterday restores my faith that someone cares about passengers. A four hr delay at Midway - airport staff were apologetic and sincere the crew were accommodating and we received an unexpected $100 voucher. SWA used to be the cheapest but the fares have gone up. I believe to cover free baggage. But in our case it was cheaper because the fees on the other airlines made their flights higher. I know their are a lot of complaints about seats. I used to hate SWA for that reason. I also don't like that the 24hr checkin still gives you only an A30 at best since they sell the first half of the A seats now for business select or a fee. But if you check in early you still have a good selection. The other airlines are sneakier. You may get an assigned seat but do you really have a choice? Most of my recent flights have shown me a chart selection of all centre seats and the aisles and windows for sale! Not a good way to build loyal customers.,10southwest-airlines,25/07/12,Round Trip Newark to Denver. All flights on time. Boarded with A group. Completely uneventful and not exciting flights. Cheapest air fare and bags free is a big plus. All in all a quality experience if bland.,9southwest-airlines,19/07/12,After a five hour delay (understandable because it was weather related) we finally boarded our plane to San Francisco via Chicago. It wasn't until Chicago that they told us that our leg to San Francisco was canceled and the plane was now traveling to Los Angeles. Being stranded in Chicago with a five month old is not my idea of a vacation. On the return trip we got routed to Minneapolis (again weather). However when we did get to Chicago we were told we now had to switch planes for the final leg back to CT. We specifically booked flights with no plane change because that is a hassle with an infant. My family will never fly Southwest again.,2southwest-airlines,09/07/12,"I fly frequently for my business. Southwest usually has the cheapest fares and the fact that bags fly free. Their ""Open Seat"" boarding policy is a little different since they are one of the only airlines that have this policy. I do see both sides of the arguments where you like to know where you seating upon booking the flight but also love the freedom of choosing your own seat as you get on the plane. The earlier you check in the better the chance of getting the seat of your preference. I hardly ever experience rudeness from staff. Flight attendants often add in comedic little quips in their safety instruction demonstration which I saw as quite amusing. When it comes to flying for me 75% of the time I fly with Southwest.",8southwest-airlines,04/07/12,I flew from San Antonio to San Diego flight #2523 on 6/29/12. I was not familiar with their boarding system. I did not know what the number pole at the boarding area was for. I wish they had informed passengers that we need to stay in number order. The guy doing the boarding stopped me and made me wait while everyone in my group boarded. I thought that was very rude. I also did not know they put the menu in the back of the seat. When I ask the attendant what they have to drink she was very rude and told me to look at the menu. Their fare is cheap. The seats and aisle are very cramped. My flight was 30 minutes late. They take you from A to B - that is about it. My experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I always thought highly of Southwest but not anymore.,4southwest-airlines,01/07/12,SLC-DEN-MDW - Flying with my 3 kids and 2 nephews to visit Grandpa in Chicago. On our Denver layover after waiting for 5 hours our flight was canceled due to electrical problems at MDW. We were directed to the SW ticket gate into a line with hundreds of people. After waiting in the line for an hour with 5 kids and hearing other passengers leave the line being told they would not get a flight for 2 days I found a hotel and rented a car for the night. In the morning I called SW to ask about rebooking our canceled flight. The agent told me I had to go to the airport to get someone to do it for me. She confirmed that my only option to get on a SW flight would be to drag 5 kids to the airport to wait for the next available flight in 40 hours and hope we got on that one. That is not a reasonable option so we rented a minivan in Denver and drove to Chicago. SW also lost our luggage. Multiple attempts to call resulted in no one helping us. When we arrived in Chicago went to Midway and the bag was sitting there. I am so frustrated with an industry that is all take no give. You make them all these guarantees jump through their hoops and they give you nothing in return not even a refund when their product fails.,2southwest-airlines,01/07/12,"Southwest gets zero stars for one reason and one reason only. Their ""Open Seating"" policy. Bags fly free but at SW passengers are just another bag. You pay good money to stand in a cattle chute and then maybe have to ask someone's permission to sit in a seat if you are not lucky enough to get a good boarding position. With other airlines I know I will have a seat of my choosing no matter when I board. This is called ""Customer Service"" which is apparently a foreign concept to SW.",1southwest-airlines,28/06/12,"Flew from Vegas to Chicago. Once we got the Vegas airport we noticed a very disgruntled vibe. The usually happy Southwest employees were very grouchy and seemed bothered to be there. We boarded the plane actually got the very first seat with tons of leg room and finally had the opportunity to stretch out for the long ride home. From the moment the plane was to take off the complaining started. I guess there was some sort of issue with the transair merger and the flight attendant union because that is all I heard about for the entire flight. They just went on and on as if they were out for coffee at some cafe. I don't even think they realized how inappropriate it was to complain while they were on the job and within earshot of customers. It made us very uncomfortable and annoyed. Once we landed and all of bags didn't make it that kind of sealed the deal for us. No more Southwest. Beware when you check your bags you may not see them again. We did get our bag back at midnight so we were the lucky ones. I guess the ""we don't really care"" attitude of Southwest is my major complaint.",2southwest-airlines,21/06/12,"6/08/12 Flew from LAX (Los Angeles) to LAS (Las Vegas). Flight was delayed by 20 minutes which was not even bad. We were further delayed in the air for 20 more minutes because President Obama was landing at the same airport as we were. Other than that the flight attendants were courteous the seats were decent had good leg room (I'm 6.2""). Returned on 6/12/12 LAS to LAX. The incoming Flight was delayed for 2.5hrs due to bad weather from the region it was coming from. I got my round trip ticket for $90. I'll definitely fly again!",10southwest-airlines,20/06/12,I have flown Southwest a number of times now. I have never experienced a problem with their staff whatsoever. I just got back from a trip from KMCO (Orlando) to KPIT (Pittsburgh) I am a student pilot myself so when we landed I asked one of the flight attendants if I could peek in the flight deck and they were very nice. The seats are all leather with adequate leg room. That is coming from a guy over 6 feet tall. I like the fact that Southwest does not separate the cabin by class. Apparently recently they began offering Nilla wafers as an In-Flight snack. I did not particularly care for them. Bottom line I would recommend flying Southwest. You can get a round trip ticket for $200.,10southwest-airlines,17/06/12,When my flight was changed I thought my seat was guaranteed - after waiting 6 hours at the airport and finally on the plane I got called to the front just to get pulled for another passenger and then was told I need to pay extra to guarantee a seat on the next flight that was another 4 hours away. The worst 11 hours of my life.,2southwest-airlines,14/06/12,I printed my boarding passes at home I got A50 for departure 6 hours after the printing starting time (24 hours) and for my return I got A44 printed only 20 minutes after the beginning of the 24 hours window. So whether you print your boarding pass early or late makes no difference. At the airport there are no instructions about the boarding process. So finally I stood in line with the rest. On my return they had 2.5 hours delay the excuse being the weather in Houston. On the return trip the flight attendants gossiped and laughed loudly like 2 schoolgirls preventing us the exhausted passengers from getting a bit of rest. All in all do your best to avoid Southwest even if you pay a little more.,2southwest-airlines,14/06/12,LAX to Vegas to Burbank. On time seats very comfortable cheerful staff. Very laid back feel. The only downfall is no entertainment and planes seem a little old. Great for the price.,7southwest-airlines,12/06/12,Flew SWA for the first time between Boston and St Louis for business. On the way out to STL I had a non- stop however on the return I had to fly through BWI (Baltimore). Nevertheless both flights were pleasant and I was very impressed with their overall care of their paying customers. Will definitely fly them again.,8southwest-airlines,06/06/12,Two round trips so far have been excellent in every respect: on time easy boarding pleasant crew (glad to say official flight time is under 2 hours; can't comment on comfort on a longer haul.) Of course SW is known for the several special ways it rises above the competition: consistently cheap fares (at least for our route) those two pieces of free checked baggage and the free reservation changes. Easy to use website is another nice advantage. As I mentioned among us we will likely be doing 6 or more round trips on this SW route each year for a while so I will be sure to review again if any of the above changes.,8southwest-airlines,04/06/12,RNO-DEN-IAD-BWI-LAS-RNO. Good fares pleasant staff on-time for the most part and when a delay comes up we are informed. This trip held true to that again. But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really. Just remember to buy a meal before you get on a long flight and if you don't mind a long flight on a small plane then Southwest is the way to go. Plus you can't beat the two free check-in bags.,9southwest-airlines,29/05/12,We fly SWA on all occasions from San Jose CA to Ontario CA. We have a 5 year old and this is where my comment comes in. Thinking my son has passed the pre-boarding age we ignored the PA announcement and waited in line. The gate agent spotted my family and I and came to personally asked us to board along with the other pre-boarders. Because of this gesture we now minimized flying Alaska Airlines. These two airlines were our sources for price comparisons whenever we do our travel. Now we don't even bother as the prices are relatively similar and go directly to SWA.,8southwest-airlines,21/05/12,Southwest are a cheap and cheerful airline and you get what you pay for. The cabin crew are generally friendly and helpful the aircraft's clean although seating is tight as you would expect on a budget airline. Over the past couple of years I have flown 7 sectors with them and my only complaint is with the ground check-in staff. They are with rare exception a miserable unhelpful lot who seem to think their faces would break if they smiled. The check-in system is different to what I am used to and the counter staff seemed to look down their noses in disdain when I was not sure how things worked. Would I fly with them again probably not there are a lot of other airlines competing for the same business.,6southwest-airlines,21/05/12,OAK-ABQ return. From Oakland check-in was quick but security was a hassle inflight they offered stale Nilla wafers and the usual drinks so admittedly that part was very ordinary. Staff were very nice though and seemed to like their jobs and the seats were very comfortable. The return from Albuquerque was pretty much the same except better security more drink runs but less room. Still it gets the job well done and at a great price and it flies out of Oakland. I'll come back even it isn't high-frills.,8southwest-airlines,16/05/12,DCA to Islip NY on US Airways Express/Republic Airlines/Air Wisconsin (these three names were either on the plane or my ticket) and it was not a good experience. BWI to Islip my normal way to get there on Southwest is professional clean easy to book and I get an overall confident feeling that they all know what they are doing. It took being lured into the DCA/US Airways flight by the relative convenience to see the other side but I learned my lesson. I'll drive the 50 miles to get to BWI from now on.,10southwest-airlines,14/05/12,We travelled on three different legs with Southwest recently and were very impressed with the friendly crew clean and comfortable plane free baggage and the plane left and arrived on time or early on each occasion. On two of three legs we paid the extra $10 for priority boarding - well worth as the flight was quite cheap compared to other airlines in the first place. The free drink and nuts were a bonus.,9southwest-airlines,09/05/12,I usually enjoy travelling on Southwest I like the relaxed and friendly crew. The free checked bag policy is really a plus. The boarding and open seating policy is speedy and efficient and its no problem finding seats for the family together if you check-in online 24 hours in advance. The coffee if free and as much as you want seconds and thirds on snacks too. 5$ in-flight Wifi is great for doing work. Not so great for video streaming though. The seats are comfortable enough I never get uncomfortable.,9southwest-airlines,07/05/12,As a family of four with children ages 7 and 11 we had to sit in 3 different locations both on our flight to Florida and our return trip. This was unacceptable and staff simply shrugged and said there was nothing they could do about it. They did ask a single passenger to move so that our 7 year old be permitted to sit with his mother on the return flight. I would very highly recommend against any and all families ever even considering to fly Southwest airlines.,1southwest-airlines,01/05/12,In the past two weeks I flew Southwest cross country and also another major airline. The contrast between Southwest and this other airline was unreal. Friendly courteous organized on time generous with baggage check (no fees for first 2) generous with snacks/drinks. The only reason I took another airline in the first place was because Southwest didn't fly to the location I had to visit.,9southwest-airlines,24/04/12,We flew Southwest with our 3 young boys. Extremely nervous because my older son is peanut and peanut dust allergic. Flight attendants were aware and made the flight peanut free. Our 1st plane was freshly cleaned we were able to pre-board. Seats are leather so made it easier to clean. Our return flight flight attendants also made sure no peanuts were served the check-in counter confirmed his allergy was in the system and everyone was aware. We also pre-boarded and on both flights sat in bulkhead seats. Southwest was great extremely considerate and very professional.,10southwest-airlines,23/04/12,Besides the obvious advantages of reasonable prices 2 free checked bags and free coffee tea water soda and snacks on flights what you need to know about Southwest is that they are almost always on time and quite often arrive early. We have never had a problem with luggage - checked or carried on. Flight staff are pleasant Seats aren't the roomiest ever but flights aren't that long.,9southwest-airlines,21/04/12,I fly Southwest frequently and until my most recent flight I have been a satisfied customer. Last flight was my first on a plane with their redesigned/reconfigured interior. There is simply less legroom with the new seat configuration. I was cramped and uncomfortable. The seats themselves are very nice but if you are 6 ft or taller you will be uncomfortable. The purpose of this review is to simply give a heads up to people whose height might make a long trip very uncomfortable.,5southwest-airlines,20/04/12,Recently took 7 Southwest flights within the USA and could not complain about one of them. They don't have select seating but as they are usually short flights it doesn't matter. All flights were on time and the staff very friendly.,9southwest-airlines,20/04/12,LAS-OMA-LAS. I like flying Southwest because it's the most hassle-free airline in the US. However the plane I took yesterday was filthy and I am not talking about dirt from the last flight. This dirt was on the carpet and side of seats. Food particles dried up soda chewing gum etc. Keeping a cabin clean is easy and should be paramount.,5southwest-airlines,15/04/12,Newark-Denver return. Outbound flight on time checked in easily online and bag drop and boarding was swift. Cabin crew were excellent and very attentive. Complimentary drinks were great and snacks were good. A meal for the 3.5 hour flight would have been more substantial. Flight back was 3 hours late. We checked in online without difficulty. Bag drop and boarding was just as swift and the crew were excellent. Legroom both ways was well above what you get with most low cost airlines.,9southwest-airlines,10/04/12,My wife and I recently flew from Newark to Reno via Chicago (Midway) and then Reno to Newark with a connection in Phoenix. The boarding process was simple and quick flight attendants on all 4 planes were very courteous. Our plane from Phoenix was delayed 15 minutes however we landed on time. The other 3 flights all landed early. Pleasant experience highly recommended.,9southwest-airlines,09/04/12,Roundtrip between Baltimore and Greenville SC. Had to leave very early and change in Chicago on the way out which does not make sense. Dislike the general admission seating cattle call. Some passengers were very rude about it on the return flight. Will be sticking with United or another legacy carrier from here on out. Might pay a little more but would rather have a more comfortable flight.,1southwest-airlines,08/04/12,SMF-ONT. Southwest is the only airline non-stop on this route. Check-in was fairly quick. We paid $10 for early check-in and still weren't near the front of the line but managed to get emergency row seats. Service was fine. Nothing special but flight was just an hour long. Flight was on time and our luggage arrived safely.,7southwest-airlines,27/03/12,"We recently traveled as a family of 4 with children aged 7 and 11. Due to the fact that there is no reserved seating we were forced to sit in 3 very separate places throughout the plane on both outgoing and incoming flights. Both flights were very miserable. Their rates may be low but do remember the old adage ""you get what you pay for""!",2southwest-airlines,26/03/12,Houston to Newark roundtrip. Two free 50lb checked bags and a carry on and large purse. Staff are friendly planes always clean and leg room is good. They have been updating their fleet with newer restrooms cabin interior and wifi. They give free soda juice water and snacks. Charge for alcohol and energy drinks.,9southwest-airlines,12/03/12,IND to MSY with a layover in MCO round trip. Flight attendants had conversations with passengers which gave all 4 of my flights a friendly atmosphere. All but 1 of my flights arrived early. Make sure you check-in as soon as you can so you aren't stuck with a middle seat.,9southwest-airlines,07/03/12,LAX-LAS. Flight left/arrived on time. Quick 45 min flight from LA to Vegas free drink and snack served. Leg room ok as flight was completely full. Southwest allow 2 free checked bags as opposed to most other US airlines who charge for checked baggage.,8southwest-airlines,27/01/12,BUF-LAX (via PHX) SAN-SFO and SFO-BUF (with a stop in MDW along the way). Paid $125 each way between BUF and LAX and between SFO and BUF and $49 for SAN-SFO. Fare included 2 free checked bags. Excellent value for price paid! All my flights arrived early and were operated by newish 737-700's. All flights (except SFO-BUF) were packed but I got the bulkhead window seats which were very comfortable. FA's were friendly especially on the BUF-PHX and MDW-BUF legs. Having Internet on my long return flight made the time fly by and for the most part it worked very well.,9southwest-airlines,21/01/12,"SJC to SNA return. I checked in online for both flights early enough to get an ""A35"" boarding position for both flights and that was good enough to get seats in an emergency exit aisle with great legroom. Both flights on time and flight attendants efficient and friendly. There is no inflight entertainment unless you bring a laptop to use their WiFi and you still get a free soft drink and peanuts/pretzels. Being able to check-in a suitcase for free is fantastic nowadays! I would rate the seat comfort very good.",9southwest-airlines,13/01/12,Chicago Midway to Boston return. Flights operated by a relatively new 737-700. Both on time. Leg room is generous for a low cost carrier. Flight attendants were polite and efficient. I was allowed to check in two 50lb bags for free and to take a carry-on bag as well. Seats were comfortable and leg room decent especially for a low cost. We were served a complimentary snack and offered non-alcoholic beverages with free re-fills. Boarding was efficient. My only quirk with Southwest is that they do not have assigned seating hence getting a preferred seat is tricky unless you pay the extra $10 and get early boarding. I had not done that but in hindsight I think the extra $10 is well worth it (especially if you want a window seat). I highly recommend Southwest due to their efficiency friendly staff and complimentary beverages.,8southwest-airlines,12/01/12,"BUF-TPA return flights on time. B737-700 to Tampa and 737-500 back to Buffalo both quite clean although B737-500 showing its age. FA's friendly especially on the way back to Buffalo. The extra $10 for early boarding was well worth it on return - ended up with a mid ""A"" boarding group number and got the Exit seat with about 3 feet of legroom in front - if you're tall this is the seat you want. My home airport is Toronto but I'll drive to Buffalo for fares that are generally half the price of flying out of Toronto.",10southwest-airlines,06/01/12,"Avoid if you are travelling with children over 4 years of age. My wife 5 year old son and I were unable to obtain a boarding pass prior to our arrival at the airport and as a result under Southwest's ""open-seat"" policy we boarded when only single seats were available. My wife politely asked if any passenger would be willing to move so our son could sit with her and no one responded. The flight attendant did not attempt to assist us despite witnessing our dilemma. Fortunately a sympathetic passenger finally offered to move to allow my wife to sit with our son. It appears Southwest has decided that 5 year old children are sufficiently mature to sit apart from their parents on 3 hour flights. I recommend that you avoid Southwest if you are flying with children over the age of 4 or your family may be placed in the same position as mine.",2southwest-airlines,15/12/11,"BOI-SNA round trip. Took my 4 year old son. We had no problems whatsoever on our flights. Connected in Las Vegas heading to SNA then Phoenix heading back to Boise. Flight from SNA to PHX was overbooked but since I was travelling with a 4 year old we got on right after the ""A"" group. I thought the boarding process was odd and I prefer assigned seating but I saved so much money on the lack of baggage fees it was worth it to me. Seats were more comfortable and I had more legroom than on other airlines I've flown. I'd fly SWA again for sure.",9southwest-airlines,21/11/11,SAN-PHX roundtrip. The flight from SAN to PHX was delayed at the gate for 40 minutes in San Diego. The plane however was a new refurbished looking 737-700. Very comfortable. The flight back was on an old worn looking 737-300. The flight was a little bumpy to begin with but it got smoother as we went along. We arrived on time at the gate in SAN. Cabin crew were friendly both ways.,7southwest-airlines,18/11/11,"DEN-LAX to connect with international flight on another carrier. On-time flight was most important. Staff at check-in gate and onboard was pleasant and professional. Clean aircraft. Seat pitch comfortable for 6-foot passenger. Fare same as other carriers but ""Bags fly free"" saved our family $60.",8southwest-airlines,01/11/11,IND-BWI and BWI-IND. First trip was on a Boeing 737-700 aircraft. Seats a little worn but plane was clean. The flight was rather empty so had three seats to myself. The crew was okay prefer flight attendants to be dressed professionally rather than casual. The flight on the way back was full plane arrived on time in BWI and crew was much better this time round. Plane an older Boeing 737-500 I believe but it was clean and inviting. I got two drinks and a snack which was quite nice.,9southwest-airlines,31/10/11,LAX-MSP-LAX. A bit quirky typical boarding procedure (line-ups on either side of numbered poles at the gates) smart-alec announcements from both pilots and flight attendants etc. However a value product: no checked baggage fees free snacks coffee and soft drinks reasonable prices for alcohol. Comfortable seating accommodating flight attendants clean airplanes and dependable service on the ground as well as in the air. All four segments of my trip were packed crew remained hospitable and efficient.,10southwest-airlines,20/10/11,Albany to Orlando. Leg room is tight seats not spacious but neither are they overly uncomfortable. Service was excellent. Humorous dialogue and an over all sharp wit one staff member was funny. He alone would make me choose Southwest again but the airline also provided a good value and pleasant trip overall. Free snacks and beverage was a nice change from some other airlines as well.,9southwest-airlines,15/09/11,ONT-SMF roundtrip. Overall good flight but they definitely need to add TV's on long haul flights. Anyway good airline and cheerful crew.,9southwest-airlines,11/09/11,Both our flights were on time and we had no hassles or problems. Our flight was only about 2 hrs long and we were a little crowded (not tons of leg room etc). I can see where this might be more of a problem for a longer flight but for us it was fine. The plane cabin seats etc. were nothing fancy but they were perfectly adequate and clean - all we needed for a family trip to Florida. Great value for the price - we had a good experience and will definitely fly Southwest in the future.,10southwest-airlines,11/09/11,DTW-MDW-GSP. Paid extra $10 to get early/priority check-in. Still ended up with boarding numbers in the high 20s. Managed to get one front row and one exit row seat for the first flight and two exit row seats for the second flight. At DTW there were lots of passengers in wheelchairs and a woeful lack of airline personnel available to take them onboard so boarding took a while. Flight into GSP not only took off on time but arrived 30 mins early. It is not always the cheapest option especially if you are adding the $10 earlybird check-in fee but in this case it worked out fine. Still not sure if I like their boarding system since it results in our standing up longer than with other airlines.,7southwest-airlines,07/09/11,Raleigh to Newark via Baltimore Washington. Had great seats on each flight with friendly crews. Nice experience with smooth trips.,9southwest-airlines,06/09/11,My first time flying domestically in the USA LAS-LAX on a $39 fare. I did online check-in the day before and was in the second boarding group. Got a row to myself. Check-in process well organised all automated at the kiosk and then your name is called to drop off your bag at a counter. Flight attendants cheerful for the early hour impressed with being allowed 2 checked bags free.,10southwest-airlines,09/08/11,I am 16 years old and recently travelled with Southwest by myself. I was nervous as this was only my second time flying. I flew SAT to BWI return. I found all of the staff to be courteous and the pilot made regular announcements. Even though there was a delay at BWI the staff kept everyone informed they quickly boarded us and flight actually was shorter than expected. I liked the open seating by paying the extra $10 for early check in I was in the first boarding group and got a window seat on both flights.,9southwest-airlines,05/08/11,I have flown over 100 flights on Southwest and have not had a bad flight. Back in the old days when the first in line got to board first we always arrived early to get the best seats. Now that Southwest issues boarding numbers we always pay the extra $10 to get priority boarding. The system of having no assigned seats is much more efficient and gets the plane off the ground much faster. Like many others I am disappointed that the Rapid Rewards Program has changed. It was a very generous program now it is similar to most of their competitors.,10southwest-airlines,02/08/11,Tampa-New Orleans. First time on a US low- cost good price for tickets. Cabin crew friendly flight crew professional. I was impressed with the seat pitch in Economy for a short sector on B737. I am 6 ft 2 inch but was comfortable compared with Transatlantic B777. I always prefer preselection of seating and not sure why SW are averse. I would happily pay a supplement.,9southwest-airlines,31/07/11,First time with Southwest as they have only recently begun servicing Newark. EWR-SAN connecting in PHX and Chicago-Midway. Booked hotel and rental car as well. Very pleased with the over all experience. Everything was exactly as stated. I enjoyed the extra inch of legroom compared to my usual airline (Continental). Flight attendants friendly and helpful with frequent offerings of refreshments and snacks. I would like to see them expand their Newark service because I would use them any day.,9southwest-airlines,29/07/11,Southwest avoids punishing customers with extra fees such as change cancellation or bag check fees where possible. If you happen to check your bags late they will accept them and try their best to get them on the plane often faster than you can make it to the gate. If it's too late to check the bags they will place them on the next flight. A-List membership allowed me to bypass check-in and security lines and get preferred boarding almost always resulting in 'first class' seating in the emergency exit row. Companion Pass allowed me to travel around the country with a good friend on the weekends I wasn't commuting for a whole year. Personalized birthday and holiday cards were also nice touches.,10southwest-airlines,28/07/11,It's very little hassle flights are almost always on time customer service is great. I enjoy the occasional jokes over the PA and the creative ways of doing the safety briefing. I like the first come-first seated policy. In terms of their cabins I find that they have good leg room that's a big selling point for me at 6'2.,10southwest-airlines,28/07/11,My wife and I have flown Southwest often in the past. We've watched the past couple years as Southwest has made cutbacks and the value of their service has declined. Our primary frustration with Southwest comes from a recent flight where we were abandoned in the Denver airport. We arrived at our departure gate in Austin to find the plane running late. When we landed in Denver I checked our connection to see that it was boarding. We arrived to see they had closed the door. We were frustrated that they wouldn't hold the plane for a few minutes to allow connecting passengers to board. We spent the night in a chilly airport and offered no dinner or breakfast voucher.,southwest-airlines,26/07/11,PHX-GEG roundtrip. Stop in OAK each way with change of planes outbound. Good trip all flights on time. Seats comfortable FA's were friendly. Only complaint would be collecting bag in PHX upon return. Took over 45 mins at when only 3-4 other flights there. Apparently the conveyor belt kept jamming but they stopped/started no less than 4 times before it was spitting out bags so fast everyone was having issues getting their bags off the belt.,9southwest-airlines,25/07/11,I loved the fact that their system for boarding a plane uses physical structure as well as simple written and verbal directions. It's very effective. I liked that I could choose from multiple snacks and take multiple bags if I wanted. The stewardesses were very friendly.,10southwest-airlines,25/07/11,Will use this airline again when travelling in the US. We flew San Diego to Las Vegas and SW was the only one that offered a direct flight at less than half the price and as a family of 7 we got to sit together. The flight attendants were very friendly.,9southwest-airlines,22/07/11,In the past I have always been very happy with Southwest however after today I am extremely upset. I had purchased a ticket of which I was not able to use. They were able to extend the unused ticket for 1 year. Today I called to attempt to use the ticket only to find out that I will not be able to use the credit as my trip is 2 weeks beyond the 1 year mark. I called customer service to request an extension ($50.00 fee of which I would happily pay). I am told that I have to wait for the credit to expire prior to their ability to extend the credit. I would then take the risk of not being able to get the flights I need for my upcoming trip. Poor Customer Service Southwest.,2southwest-airlines,11/07/11,"Never flying Southwest again. Their boarding/seating process is horrible and needlessly stressful; their ""new hip"" thing among flight staff is really annoying. My fiancÃ© and I flew across the country to get married last weekend. Of course we wanted to sit together on the 5 hour flight. But with the ridiculous system of no assigned seats there was no way to assure this. On the way back we got stuck in separate seats surrounded by a yelling and singing boy scout troop. To make things worse the flight attendants cranked up the volume on the PA system and sang the safety demonstration. In fact all announcements were done in song. This should be illegal. They seemed to think it was clever but it was a real nightmare to be strapped into one of those tiny seats surrounded by pimply screaming boy scouts and then endure warbling flight attendants blasting through the overhead speakers. A truly horrible airline. I will pay double triple quadruple to avoid flying Southwest. I will walk or crawl across the country rather than fly with these people.",southwest-airlines,06/07/11,This was my first time flying Southwest. I've used United an Delta most other times and now I know why. There is absolutely no room on these planes. your knees are all but touching the seat in front of you and the seats are way too small. I weigh 128lbs and I was very uncomfortable. I was hot and miserable. The captain never spoke to us during the flight. I've never had that happen with any other airline.,4southwest-airlines,30/06/11,I fly Southwest all the time but this particular trip was not so great! I found a really cheap flight with a 1 hr layover which turned into a 3 hr layover. Because my original flight destination time was so late a 3 hr layer had me arriving at 2am when all public transportation (which I use) has ended. I think I should have been compensated for my transportation to the city.,7southwest-airlines,28/06/11,As a former Northwest/Delta Airlines customer (exclusively) I may be easier to impress. Southwest recently started direct flights between Phoenix and Minneapolis. We purchased tickets in May at what we considered to be very reasonable fare for a roundtrip to celebrate our grandson's second birthday in Minneapolis. My father passed away two weeks prior to our scheduled departure. I called SW seeking assistance. After a brief discussion regarding the circumstances and flight availability the associate announced a fee of $783.00. With the shortest of pauses (I was choosing an appropriate reaction) he asked me to hold while he consulted with a Customer Care agent. A few more questions resulted in a change in three of the four legs of our trip for a total cost of $10.,10southwest-airlines,25/06/11,I flew SouthWest a number of times between US cities and really like the product they offer. It is low cost and I didn't experience any hidden surprises. I also like the no fuss nature the airplane comes in people get off the next lot get on and it takes off again. Itâ€™s great if you just want to get from A to B. The two checked bag allowance is a win as I arrived in the US on an international flight with 2 bags so it was helpful to have these included without additional cost (as many/all other US airlines charged). I will continue to fly SouthWest when I visit the US.,9southwest-airlines,23/06/11,I've been a Rapid Rewards member since 2000 and have spent time on the A-List (but not there currently.) SWA has consistently been above and beyond all other airlines I've flown (AMR Delta Continental) for customer service and they are much more likely to be on-time and not pulling booking shenanigans. Transparency on the (minimal) fees is a giant plus.,10southwest-airlines,10/06/11,I fly SouthWest constantly - they aren't perfect but employees are cheerful legroom and storage room at your feet is better than other airlines bags are free and there are no change fees if you need to change a flights.,10southwest-airlines,06/06/11,I am done with Southwest. I just got screwed by the inability to change a passenger just like so many others recently. The agent said they have been telling people about this for some time. News to me. As soon as I can arrange it I'm paying off my Southwest credit card and sending it and my rapid rewards card to them in pieces.,southwest-airlines,31/05/11,"Extremely disappointed in Southwest's recent changes to the policy on the inability to change a passenger name once the ticket has been purchased. I bought a ticket for an employee before this policy took effect who was not able to make the trip. Since then SW started supposedly ""enforcing a policy that has been in place"" without any sort of notification. Now I'm out almost $500 because they won't refund the ticket or allow me to use the credit for another passenger - even if it's just transferred to my name. Their reason when I filed a complaint? ""a proactive step to align our business with the general practice of the airline industry"" So it seems SW is in fact purposefully intending to become just another airline. The really upsetting part is that only a week or two earlier another trip for an employee had to be cancelled and I was able to use the flight credit for someone else. Suddenly I can't. No notification at all. I get emails just about every other day from SW advertising their ""get- away"" deals; couldn't they have simply sent out an email letting us know their policy was going to go into effect? I was an extremely loyal SW customer but they've lost my business for good. I know I'm only one of many people this has affected - they told me as much when I called to complain.",southwest-airlines,21/05/11,Terrible customer service. I purchased tickets for my employees to take a trip in October 2011 and one of the employees can no longer go. This trip has been planned 5 months in advance. Southwest will not let anyone else use the ticket even though we gave 5 months notice. They would not allow any name transfers. Only the named employee could use the ticket no else could go in her place. They would only refund if they were given a copy of a death certificate of the employee.,southwest-airlines,19/05/11,Travelled SW for the first time because my son gave me and my husband SW giftcards so we booked a trip to Vegas. We paid the extra $10. each was for early bird seating we got A section between 15 and 30 that was good. I think if you are flying as a couple it is worth the extra so you can sit together. I hear some people are saving seats for their partner which I find to be cheap. Anyway to and from Vegas we had good flights I liked choosing my seat. I will fly SW again as long as SW stays with limited extra fees. I used to fly Continental only but they have imposed more fees than I care to read about. Keep up the good work SW and we will stay loyal to you.,10southwest-airlines,18/05/11,Boston to Norfolk via Baltimore early morning. Boston to Baltimore fine but probably only because the flight was nearly empty and I could sleep. Legroom better than on other legacy carriers. Baltimore to Norfolk a horror. A very loud stewardess with a grating Southern accent spent the whole flight on the PA yelling about seatbelts how no drinks would be served due to turbulence (there was no turbulence) how no one could get out of his seat due to turbulence (there was no turbulence) how cute all the screaming babies onboard were and lastly in signature creepy Americana how there were soldiers or something onboard so to give them a loud round of applause for their service. So loud applause and the obnoxious loud flight crew prevented me from getting any sleep on the flight. I understand Southwest has a particular style - a kitsch-laden obnoxious style. It's not for me. At least the bags were free.,3southwest-airlines,17/05/11,Service was good out of PBI plane looked a little tired but seats comfortable. Upon arriving in BWI connecting flight to LGA was delayed 2.5 hrs. They need to improve their LGA service. Got there but late. Still a great airline.,5southwest-airlines,17/05/11,A mixed-bag trip from Seattle to Washington Dulles . On the plus side I had to change my itinerary at the last minute and was able to do so on Southwest at minimal cost. Flight out was uneventful. Flight back terrible I was stuck in Midway after a Dulles delay the airline stated was a mechanical problem but they refused to provide a hotel voucher. I had to find and pay for my own hotel. The gate agent was very rude.,2southwest-airlines,16/05/11,Is Southwest becoming too big? It used to be one of the few airlines I could rely on for great customer service and quality. But it seems that with the acquisition of Airtran they also acquired the bad habits of big airlines. My last trip with them was a headache that cost me $500. I got stuck in Chicago for one night and received attitude from the crew when I tried to address the issue. It is great that they don't charge for luggage but I'm curious to see how long that is going to last.,1southwest-airlines,07/05/11,"Beware more and more Southwest is just another airline. Latest casualty is the previously elegant Rapid Rewards program which used to be 16 credits=1 free flight virtually no restrictions. It has now devolved into just another points system with ever more restrictions. During the transition they are still using Awards which was the mechanism by which you reaped the reward of a free flight. But do not convert points into an award - if you do so mistakenly you will never get them converted back into points. Found this out trying to book a flight by converting to award first which was akin to the previous protocol but the flight had ""no"" award seats available. You could buy a seat with your points but after conversion to award I didn't have enough points available and Southwest has made their system physically incapable of correcting the conversion not even during this period of new learning for their customers. They make no statement that I could find that such conversions are irrevocable. In other words if you make a mistake too bad - you can pay for a ticket but Southwest won't help you correct your points v. award error and you have to wait for another flight within the coming year to use it. Yes the award expires though the points do not while you continue to generate trip activity.",2southwest-airlines,29/04/11,"New Orleans to Las Vegas and Las Vegas to SFO. Excellent experience on both journeys friendly staff on time departures and bags free. I don't understand the benefit of open seating policy but that is the only thing I didn't like. I did however pay $10 extra for early bird-check in and got an ""A"" pass between 15-20 both times. Early-bird check in automatically checks you in 24 hours before the flight thus increasing your chances of an ""A"" boarding pass. In retrospect I would only do this for longer flights when it really does help if you can avoid that middle seat.",8southwest-airlines,27/04/11,"Travelled Southwest for the first time round trip Manchester Phoenix. Cannot understand the open seating ""gimmick"" this airline uses. On the return trip we were not able to participate in the competition to call within 24 hours and get an ""earlier"" boarding assignment as we were travelling in a remote area with no cell coverage. Therefore as we were among the last to board we (and many other couples) were not able to sit together. The flight attendants ""helped"" by continuing to instruct us to just ""find a seat single seats only available"". We ended up separated by 20 rows. The reason for this practice must have something to do with saving the airline money because there is no apparent benefit for passengers. But the on line seat selection process that all the other airlines use is obviously computerized and can't cost much if anything to oversee so why does Southwest do this?? Certainly feels like one of those brilliant ideas the management team comes up with that blindly ignores the needs of some passengers. Won't fly Southwest again.",2southwest-airlines,27/03/11,TPA-MSY. I love the fact how the first and second bag are free - and they gave us our boarding passes and took our luggage away when we were still outside. The boarding and seating was a bit crazy but managed well. The small snacks were nice and great service.,9southwest-airlines,23/03/11,The service is about the same you would get at a decent restaurant seats are soft snacks are tasty no entertainment but no big deal. The flight was smooth and enjoyable. When we were in Baltimore our plane got delayed by a storm in Panama city Florida. At least our bags were free!,8southwest-airlines,14/03/11,Baltimore to Buffalo. We were very concerned about being able to deal with my mothers handicaps. From entering the airport in Baltimore to meeting our pick up in Buffalo Southwest was extremely helpful throughout the entire trip and made us very comfortable in our travel. I was very anxious about taking my mother on this trip and they truly came through for us. Thank you Southwest.,10southwest-airlines,01/03/11,After flying several other airlines to/from locations Southwest does not serve I am reminded how great Southwest's business model truly is. They are reliable honest easy to work with friendly and make travel less stressful. I try to fly Southwest to ensure I don't battle the stress of other airlines.,9southwest-airlines,25/02/11,Manchester (MHT) to Norfolk (ORF) Business select. Multiple children and elderly on the flight but it was vacation week. Flight took off late landed on time. I would not pay the 225% extra for the BS fare versus the wanna get away fare due to what you receive for that increase but work takes care of it as it is for business. The free drinks are nice even on short hops form BWI to ORF in BS. Only major complaint to Southwest Airlines do not board anyone ahead of Business select class unless they pay the same fare or please place them in rows 4 and up. When you pay $230 for Business select you should board the plane before anyone else especially if they only paid ~$89 for their ticket.,9southwest-airlines,30/01/11,Midway to Washington on very full and very cramped aircraft in cramped seats. I would not care to sit like that for more than a couple of hours. It's efficient cheap and easy to use and fine if you are of slim build.,5southwest-airlines,28/01/11,Baltimore to Boston. As soon as my flight was cancelled during the recent blizzard the agent confirmed me on a flight leaving in 5 minutes to Providence RI while the gate agents for the Providence flight held the flight for me. The flight to Providence RI still arrived pretty much on time despite the blizzard. Southwest delivered my bags to my door the next day. Everyone was courteous from check-in to arrival. I thought this was excellent service and much better than service I have gotten on the major airlines when things go wrong. Also no fees for bags no fees for drinks and pretzels onboard and I hear there are no change fees on this airline either.,9southwest-airlines,28/01/11,MDW-BDL-MDW. Checkin was fast and so was boarding nice B737. FA's talkative nice low cost airline where bags fly free. Seats comfortable typical American snacks served.,10southwest-airlines,24/01/11,Denver to San Jose and back. Did not mind grabbing whatever seat as I felt it brought out the best in most people. The staff was friendly seats were for the most part comfortable. All but the back row as those seats do not recline. The only real issue I had was that when we checked in to leave San Jose our tickets Picked up at terminal read gate 22 as well as the board. Yet some time between then and the flight the gate had changed to 23. If I had not struck up a conversation with the gentleman setting near me I would have not know until I had missed my flight. My suggestion is with your computer system you should know if a passenger has checked in before a gate change. Please make an announcement at the old gate of the change.,7southwest-airlines,18/01/11,MDW-MCO-MDW. Traveled with the family for a quick Disney vacation. Flight out on time and even with kids had no problem sitting together. On return we took advantage of the Southwest off airport check-in location in Lake Buena Vista so got the bags checked and boarding pass and even though the flight was delayed on the return we only had to get to the airport 45 minutes before our flight and were able to go straight to the gate.,8southwest-airlines,18/01/11,Southwest Airlines LGA-BWI-LGA all flights on-time. FAs very friendly and talkative free drinks is always appreciated. Free checked-in bags (2) compared to other airlines that will nickel and dime you for everything. Plane was clean boarding was fast and efficient. Wonderful airline excellent customer service from ground crew to flight crew.,10southwest-airlines,18/01/11,PIT-LAX Was a little leery about flying across the country with Southwest (usually use it to fly across Pennsylvania) but decided to give it a try because I absolutely refuse to pay an airline to carry a bag. I was not at all disappointed. The good service I had received on short trips was even better on the longer flight. Snacks were fine the personnel was kind (something it is difficult to say for the legacy carriers) and the seats were comfortable. I booked a flight recently to the West Coast and once again chose Southwest.,10southwest-airlines,17/01/11,TUL-SAT-TUL Go this route often mostly because of price but will continue to use. Day before Christmas Eve less than 48 hours after my mother passed away 6:00am flight mind in a fog I left my cell phone at the baggage check in SAT. Went through long security line sat down at the gate and realized it was missing. Told the gate agent who quickly phoned down to the baggage desk to ask if it was there - and it was! Flight boarding time running out and agent from the baggage desk RAN it down to the gate as I would have never made it back through security again. Now that's customer service.,10southwest-airlines,17/01/11,SAN to ELP return (through PHX). Having flown SWA for years there is great comfort in understanding the boarding process and open seating. The flight crews are professional and engaging service is well done with a selection of soft-drinks wine beer and juices and sometimes a choice of peanuts or pretzels. There is one non-stop flight each day both ways on this route and choices of flights to SAN through LAS and occasionally ALB. SWA is reliable and accommodating with a simple and straightforward business model.,10southwest-airlines,09/01/11,DEN-LAS return. Bags do fly free. Online check in is fine. Bag drop at Denver fast enough for those checked-in. Swift flight down. Soft drinks & peanuts handed out. OK in flight magazine. Uneventful. Return journey was terrible. 6am flight. Checked in OK but no staff appeared until 4.45am by which time a massive queue had formed. We hardly had time to get a snack before boarding but then had to wait on the plane for other late folk. Laughable. I can see where they save money: reduce staffing. Arrived in Denver OK but really it is quite a flimsy airline as the service in Las Vegas shows.,4southwest-airlines,05/01/11,"San Jose (SJC) to Santa Ana (SNA) return. For both flights checking in on-line 24 hours before each flight got me an ""A25"" or better boarding pass and on both flights I was able to get a window seat on the over-wing emergency exit row with lots of leg room. On the flight to SNA the flight attendant spent quite a bit of time going over the emergency exit procedures which I think was a great example of how this airline can be both professional (take care of serious business) and laid back (announcements are usually quite funny and entertaining!). Soft drinks and peanuts served on these 1-hour flights and two suitcases checked in free.",10southwest-airlines,03/01/11,My teenage daughters and I flew SouthWest San Diego - Vegas return. We found them to be brilliant and far better than their European equivalents - easyjet and Ryanair. We checked in online as soon as the 24 hour window opened boarded amongst the first passengers - thus avoiding the scramble and able to sit together. The boarding process is far smoother than in Europe and although the flight was only an hour long we were served complimentary soft drinks and peanuts/pretzels. The outward flight was on time and return delayed 20 mins or so. The cabin crew were courteous and friendly and safety announcements were light hearted and funny but got the message across - we probably paid more attention to these humorous announcements than we would have to the regular dry offerings. The flights (pre booked in September) were good value and we would have no hesitation in flying SouthWest again.,10southwest-airlines,31/12/10,Southwest is at best a fair weather friend. My latest trip has been an epic debacle with poor customer relations shoddy baggage handling and a consistent and frustrating choice by this airline to make no effort whatsoever to get me home. Flying Southwest is like driving a car without insurance - ok until something goes wrong. And when something does go wrong Southwest will do nothing to make it right unlike better airlines. Customer loyalty means nothing to this airline as well.,southwest-airlines,19/12/10,DEN-SLC very late booking less than 12 hours before flight left a good fare and no hassle. Flight was full but crew provided service with a smile. If you follow their booking system you cannot fault them at all. Compared to legacy carriers within the US Southwest are the best.,10southwest-airlines,12/12/10,My husband has been unemployed a while and we were wondering how we were going to get my daughter a plane ticket to come home for Christmas. Southwest Airlines have really fair prices their website is customer friendly. When we found my daughter's situation had changed and she would be able to come home earlier it was very easy to change her flight online - and Southwest didn't charge a big fee to change the ticket. Only a few dollars that was the higher price of the new ticket.,10southwest-airlines,25/11/10,As a young inexperienced traveler I relied on our travel agent to recommend the best airline for our honeymoon. She recommended Southwest as the best. We book at a reasonable rate for the holiday season as soon as tickets became available. Everything was good to go until we got our tickets with no seat number. We ended up being one of the last people on the plane with only a few middle seat left scattered across the plane when we got on. Then we saw an open pair together only to be rudely told by a stewardess that they were reserved in case another family boarded. I politely said how about a new family we just got married. She rudely said no find a seat and turned around. Luckily a kind man gave us his seat so we could sit together but the rest of the trip we full of rude comments from the stewardess about how she couldn't believe he moved!,3southwest-airlines,18/11/10,We were forced to change our scheduled departure from New Orleans because my partner became seriously ill. We departed New Orleans three days early. We paid $200.00 in additional fees for the flight rescheduling which to me was acceptable by today's rules. I asked Southwest for a refund of the Early Bird Seating fee ($20.00) sending them the hospital and rescheduling documentation. Southwest called and said they would refund $200.00 because of the medical emergency - said they did not believe in taking advantage of their customers. I have always found Southwest Airlines to be fair honest and customer friendly which is why I stay with them.,10southwest-airlines,11/11/10,My original ticket from Palm Beach Florida to Denver Colorado was screwed up through American Airlines. They wanted to charge me $900 to fix it. I was trying to figure out something to do and ended up talked to agents at SWA and without a thought they started working the problem for me. By the end of the it I had a ticket for $400 and was set to go! They took care of everything and I was on my way before I knew what to do.,10southwest-airlines,28/10/10,More and more disenchanted with Southwest. Used them three times this summer and the experience got worse each time. Southwest check in and other representatives rude. No wonder the bags fly free Southwest has no intention of taking reasonable care with them. Now we have discovered that they make you sign a waiver saying that they aren't responsible if your golf clubs don't arrive at your destination or if they are damaged in transit. Also on our last two flights the attendants made the safety briefing into a real joke and didn't even complete it properly. It is nice to try to make flying fun but I think that they are crossing the line. Not all customers are frequent flyers who are familiar with the safety aspects of a plane. They used to be my favorite airline but not anymore. They are not always the least expensive and definitely lack customer service.,5southwest-airlines,11/10/10,Phoenix to Detroit. Very good service. Had a toddler travelling with us and check-in was super efficient. It took less than five minutes and we were off with our boarding passes. I travel Southwest at least once a month and I will continue to travel with them even if their prices increase.,10united-airlines,01/08/15,"Every time I fly United something happens to derail my trip or make my trip miserable. This trip we missed our connecting flight because we sat on the tarmack in Boston for an hour because they were having delays in loading luggage.  We missed our connecting flight by 10 minutes and are now stuck overnight in Denver. So let me see, they could have waited 5-10 minutes for us to make our scheduled flight, or not wait and pay hotel and food for two people. What kind of business sense is that? This was my last straw with United - I will avoid this airline at all costs. ",1united-airlines,31/07/15,"My experience took a full 2 days when it should have taken only 15 hours. My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals. Then once the luggage came we had to wait for at least an hour to go through the last inspection and then we we were home free. ",3united-airlines,29/07/15,"Everytime I fly with this airline there is a 3 or more hour delay due to ""awaiting aircraft."" One time is was because the pilot was in a different city and had to get to Boston to fly out, which took 5 hours! Another time the plane was awaiting the crew which was coming from a different city apparently. Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous. First off I had a connection flight and was not notified of the delay. Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time. So in my experience this airline is all about delays if your current flight is coming from another city. I get it, things happen but this airline really needs to improve its punctuality. I only took this flight this time beacuse of my miles and I was disappointed again.",1united-airlines,28/07/15,"I found all the staff I interacted with friendly and professional, the aircraft was clean, the food was fine but not enough. The seats were a nice size. I had never flown with United before and was pleasantly surprised. Although I was sat next to morbidly overweight people on both my flights the seats were big enough that the people next to me did not squeeze onto my seat like they usually do on Virgin flights which I liked. I was late getting to the gate (very much my fault) and the initial employee I spoke to was rude and short with me and refused to even see if I could make it to the flight even though my baggage was still on board and the food was not yet delivered to the plane, she told me ""no, you aren't getting on the flight"" and refused to even see if it was a possibility. Thank goodness for the other lady who phoned someone, told me I was fine to get on the plane because they were waiting for the food and my luggage was still aboard, and sent me through. I slept most of the flight to the UK. The touch screen with my seat on the way back to the USA was really finicky which was a bit annoying, I liked the selection of movies and that they played as soon as I was sat in my seat rather than waiting till after take off for them to work. I bought duty free stuff inflight and the staff that helped me were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline and will use it again.",8united-airlines,28/07/15,"Delays were not announced to passengers in a timely manner and lack of assistance in order to accommodate or aide in booking other flights for customers to either reach their connecting flights or to their destinations was displeasing. The way the United Airlines handled my partner's luggage that was left behind at our originating destination was a stressful start to our trip. Upon arriving at the airport around 5.45pm to catch our 8.20pm flight, flight 5237, from Sacramento to Los Angeles, on Monday July 20 2015, we checked in promptly and breezed through security. We sat by the gate with a plane that sat there for as long as we had, little did we know this was our plane. By the time boarding came around, our flight was delayed for another hour, occurring multiple times for the next few hours. It was my hope that during the initial delay the service desk would help customers explore other options to reach connecting flights and/or destinations to avoid delays or issues upon arriving in Los Angeles. We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online. We called customer service a few times to inquire about alternative options but were never offered alternatives until hours later right before the last delay was lifted after 11am and needed to quickly decide on either taking the flight or flying out of another airport. I am baffled at the lack of customer service. My second and major complaint was the issue with our checked luggage getting left behind in Sacramento as we made our way to Cancun. We checked in before 6pm and sat at the terminal looking at the same airplane the entire time until we boarded it only to find out my luggage was never placed on the same plane. ",1united-airlines,28/07/15,"Round trip Newark to Rome on an updated Boeing 767. Coach seats very comfortable. IFE was good, on demand movies, tv. Meals were edible, which is all I have come to hope for. Flights on time and bags arrived with us. Only issue was the surly treatment from almost all the flight attendants. Don't know why they hate their customers so much. I fly with United Airlines often, but they either need to lose the ""friendly skies"" tag line or, better yet, train their crew in the basics of good customer service.",8united-airlines,27/07/15,"I have travelled to the USA on many occasions mainly to visit family and go on shopping sprees. I mainly use United Airlines as I always found them to have competitive prices and good baggage allowances. However on my last few trips the free baggage allowance was reduced from two bags to one. Last week my bag was only 4 lbs overweight and I was charged the enormous amount of $200. I realise that there are reasons for charging for overweight bags, but there are plenty customers who are overweight and are not charged extra for seats and there was also lots of youngsters travelling with 2 large pieces of hand luggage struggling to carry bags along the aircraft walkway. I think it's wrong that an average size and weight customer gets charged a huge amount for a 4lb overweight bag.",5united-airlines,27/07/15,"The brand of this airline is ""Friendly"". Well, I must say they are everything but friendly. Not a single smile in ground nor during the flight. No thank you, no complete sentences when they throw the food to the passengers like cattle. Rude, arrogant staff not speaking foreign languages. Any European airline, even the worst, is better than any American airline. At least nowadays.",3united-airlines,27/07/15,We booked our family of four on a flight 7 months. After several flight number and times changes we just learned that our 8 and 7 year old have seats 10 rows away from us and each by themselves. We call 56 days before traveling and the only way we can make a change is is giving them more money or wait until the day of travel and rely on the kindness of stranges. Will never fly United again. .,1united-airlines,26/07/15,"United uses A320 on too many longer flights within the United States. They are annoying and uncomfortable. They ""upgraded"" their seats after merging with Continental which really means a downgrade. They crammed more seats on their airbus airplanes making legroom even more restricted. They removed all forms of entertainment from their fleet. I used to be able to listen to the radio in the armrests with my own headphones, but they removed them and I am incredibly bored, cannot get to sleep because of how uncomfortable the seats are now! They don't use the television screens that fold down anymore, they have incredibly rude and unhelpful employees. United Airlines is expensive for the quality of service you get. ",1united-airlines,26/07/15,"As a child our family always flew United. However, it has gotten progressively worse through the years to the point that I would rather pay a more for a ticket than fly United ever again. Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo, the check in machine didn't work right. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but said she could not help us with gate-to-gate connection (e.g. passenger carts) as that was something ""you didn't do"" and simply didn't seem to care that we had a need. In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off, causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter, saw our plane sitting at the gate, but weren't allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us, ""Oh, we knew you were coming. We just couldn't wait for you.""  To make matters worse United booked us on a flight to Anchorage for the next night. In the end we got flights on Alaska Airlines and got into Anchorage about 2:30am which allowed us time to sleep in our booked hotel room before making the trip to Seward by bus, getting us there in plenty of time to board our ship. Alaska Airlines personnel were superb in demeanor, helpfulness, and care, something that United personnel were seriously lacking. Our return trip from Vancouver, BC to Buffalo started out much differently than when we went. The staff in Vancouver were helpful and courteous. But once we got to Chicago, they were anything but! I think the personnel of United Airlines in the US could take a few lessons from those from our Vancouver neighbors. We have had other unacceptable experiences in the past with United Airlines but this one takes the cake and is really the one that put us over the edge. No more United Airlines for this family!",1united-airlines,24/07/15,"Since there is only one flight a day to Aguadilla PR from Newark we have taken this flight a number of times, it is always late. In January, the delay was due to ""insufficient crew"" this time, the almost 1.5 hour delay was due to ""awaiting aircraft"". This flight had incredibly cramped seats that are hard and have almost no recline. The pocket in fron of the seat was very low on the seat in front so that when I put my book in the pocket it bulged out so much that I had to keep my knees apart. The entertainment is only for a $7.99 fee per person, and there was only one offer of a four ounce cup of a liquid for the entire 3.5 hour flight. United planes are new so this uncomfortable seat situation is going to continue, I would avoid United if at all possible. Fares are also higher than other carriers.",1united-airlines,24/07/15,"It's unfortunate nowadays that people only ever seem motivated to write if they have a 'bad experience'. I have flown with UA pretty regularly from Australia to East coast USA and have had no real issues. The 787 is a great plane, the crew on these flights are experienced and efficient and the food is generally on a par with competitive airlines. As a business traveller though punctuality is extremely important and this is where UA has excelled. In my past five trips I have been delayed only once and this delay was handled very professionally. I have no issues with UA. ",8united-airlines,23/07/15,"We booked our family vacation months in advance and had chosen seat assignments at that time so my family could all sit together 4 of us going down 6 of us coming back. We get to the airport and go to talk to customer service prior to the flight to try and do a seat adjustment no one was there and they did not show until 10 min prior to boarding. The agent was very rude with my wife and refused to help and told her to talk to other passengers on the plane. We board the aircraft brand new to find that the seats were so close together that at 6 Feet tall my knees were in the seat in front of me and the entertainment system did not work. We board our second flight, I sit down and literally have the seat back cave in with an audible pop. The seats should have been replaced years ago by the time we got off the aircraft 5 hours later my wife and I could barley walk. Coming back and go to drop off the bags they had 6 lines going and one attendant, get our boarding passes and they had us divided up all over the aircraft, talked to the gate attendant his response we have been paging you and was very rude with us. I have a type one diabetic and a 3 yo that needs someone to ride with them, after fighting with them got it fixed meanwhile my other 2 children had to sit elsewhere on the plane and not with us. The trip home had two layovers and this same thing happened at every one. I watched one agent belittle another passenger over how to stow a bag without even offering to assist. Their customer service is awful, their only saving grace is the flight attendants were pleasant and friendly.",1united-airlines,23/07/15,"I was traveling to Las Vegas for a short 2 day trip with my family of 4. My flight was scheduled for around midday. Fifteen minutes before the flight my Dad received an email saying the flight was delayed until 2.30. I was annoyed but ok about the 2 hour wait. Then he received another email saying that the flight had been delayed until 9.15, this is unnacceptable as this was a 9 hour wait and we had different things booked in Las Vegas for my family to attend. We had recieved no apology until my Father went to customer services and we recieved different seats on our plane which didn't even make a difference. This inconvenience wasted a day of our trip and I certainly do not recommend flying with United Airlines.",1united-airlines,22/07/15,"On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home. I will never fly United again.",1united-airlines,22/07/15,"On my e-confirmation it clearly states â€œmealâ€ù. After about an hour in the air I asked the FA when meal service would begin, I was told there was no meal service on this flight.

However, it does state on the website, in-flight services, Business/Business First, Meals and beverages: Pre-departure beverage service Complimentary beverages, including beer, wine, spirits, soft drinks and freshly brewed coffee Meal service on flights longer than two hour - my flight was nearly 3 hours. The next leg, while I was sitting in the cabin and freezing, I asked for a blanket, and was told there are no blankets on this flight. It was the usual poor attitude FAâ€™s present on the regional jets. For a long time I was a loyal customer.",1united-airlines,20/07/15,"My entire experience with United this weekend was a total disaster. To begin, my flight from Denver to Bend on Friday night was cancelled last minute due to no availability of pilots. They actually scanned our boarding passes in and had us lined up ready to get on the plane just to have us turn around and go back inside to later find out our flight would be cancelled. We then had to fly to Eugene instead, rent a car, and drive 2.5 hours to get to our destination (Bend). Then, I was told my bag would arrive at our place of stay the next morning. I did not receive my bag until 7pm on the 17th. Then, as if this wasn't enough to deal with on our way there, my flights coming home were a disaster as well. We had to return our rental car to Redmond rather than Eugene as that's where our flight was leaving on Sunday. Then, the flight from Redmond to Denver was ""overweight"" due to temperatures in the area. We had to wait until 5 people volunteered to change flights before our flight could leave. I get to Denver only to find out my flight from Denver to SLC was delayed. Not to mention, I already had a 3 hour layover and this delay made it 4+ hours. The flight continued to get delayed and didn't end up leaving Denver until about 1am. I did not get home until 3am. I am completely upset with my entire United experience and will not be flying United again. The customer service was awful. None of the employees even knew what was going on and when approached with a question they were unbelievably disrespectful.",1united-airlines,20/07/15,Flight cancelled due to maintenance!

The next morning, our flight was pushed 7 times. Yes, 7 times, because the runway was ""wet"" until it finally got cancelled.

About halfway through the flight the attendant starting offering drinks. She offered a drink to both the other people in my row and then looked me in the eye and kept on going without offering me a drink.

I went to the washroom in first class because the line up was very long at the back of the plane, and since I was sitting right behind first class and no one was using the washroom at the time I decided to go use it. As soon as I walked up to use the washroom I got dirty glares from both female flight attendants, one which said you cannot use this washroom and I kindly explained how the line was extremely long at the back of the plane.

We were then placed on standby for a flight scheduled to arrive in Denver at approximately 3.00 pm. That flight was delayed over 3 hours! We discovered it had been oversold so the odds of making that flight were nil. We were forced to rent a car and drive 5 hours to Gunnision. The return trip was worse, if thats possible. The flight was scheduled to leave at noon. The first announcement was that flight was delayed. Then flight was cancelled - allegedly on the basis of mechanical problems. We were able to determine that the plane in question was still flying and headed for its next destination-leaving Gunnison passengers stranded.

What kind of company works this way? A completely full flight, not only shows up hours behind schedule, but all of the sudden has no crew? Complete blasphemy. Rude attendants.

We were served a pre-takeoff drink and then a two course meal, which consisted of mushroom soup and a beef salad/egg chicken sandwich.

They then let everyone board the plane, leave us sitting there for about 20 minutes only to tell us the flight was cancelled. A stewardess came on the intercom and told us that they knew 2 hours before boarding that the crew was going to time out but management wouldn't allow them to cancel the flight until after everyone boarded! We were then told that the next flight out wasn't until 9.40 the next morning leaving us stranded in Washington overnight. We were told that all hotels in the area were booked but then found out they were giving away rooms to others.

The boarding is similar to Southwest as you line up in group numbers. The problem is that we paid for an economy plus seat and still had to wait at the end to board. The flight crew was average but what upset me was that a poor woman with limited English asked the flight attendant for some water so she could take medication before take off. She was pointing at what she needed in the galley and the flight attendant screamed at her and threatened her with disembarkation. For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable. After a four hour stopover we boarded again with the same procedure. Once we got on our way the flight attendants provided their usual sub standard service. However, as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted. The flight attendants in first class made sure that the economy passengers stayed in their section.  All I can say is that flying domestically is more or less not worth it. Luckily, majority of my trip including two flights on Air New Zealand who treated their passengers with respect and were not afraid to offer complimentary food and drinks. It is sad that Continental Airlines got eaten up by United.

Just a few more inches of space, which is a little better than Coach. The Boeing 747 was old and worn. The senior flight crew were rude and service was terrible. They seemed to wish they were anywhere but on the plane. The food was terrible, unless you wanted to purchase food. The newly upgraded international service included boxed wine (horrible) and an appetizer to enjoy with your beverage. However, the appetizer was a cracker and a piece of cheese and that was served with the dessert. No IFE except for fixed cabin screens, but they pride themselves in offering you free wifi to watch United Airlines inflight entertainment.

The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn't matter unless it's over the 70lbs max weight. Another lady working had rudely told me that I was not allowed to have three pairs of skis in my bag, even though there was nothing I could do about it. She ""let it slide"" and charged me instead. There was no in-seat entertainment or Wi-Fi on board.",1united-airlines,26/06/15,"First leg from Harrisburg to O'Hare was delayed by 2 hours due to weather, causing me to miss my connection in Chicago. Total door-to-door travel time for this flight was about 14 hours. All staff was courteous, pleasant and efficient. WiFi entertainment system that streams TV and movies over tablets worked well, and provided lots of options. No problem finding my flights. The planes are so packed (this is industry wide, not just United) there's no flexibility in the system for weather delays. This also makes them uncomfortable. When I got annoyed enough that I tried three times to upgrade to Premium Economy hoping to score an empty center seat, United's App steadfastly refused to take my money, so I stayed wedged back in the back of the plane. Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier.  The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline. Using the smaller, regional airports like Harrisburg saves a lot of airport headaches - that's what gives United the leg up over other carriers for me.",7united-airlines,24/06/15,"A surprisingly pleasant trip. Cabin service was very good and food was good as well. Seats were very comfortable with a nice selection movies available.

The cabin service was rather low - not poor but not good either. The good part was that the air in the Boeing 787 seems to be a little more moist and the pressure was like being at a lower altitude. They said that internet service was available but all you could connect to was united.com so I gave that a fail mark.,5united-airlines,22/06/15,"UA did get me safely from Vancouver to Quito and back again, but that was about the best I can say about the experience. I found  rudeness characterizes how UA treats its customers. For example, it was clearly printed on my e-ticket that prepared meals would be provided, but what they do not say is that you first have to ask about the meal (flight staff never mentioned that food was even available), and then you are told to look at the menu if you want to purchase any food. The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief. Aside from behaving as though they were doing you a favour by even noticing that you were on the flight, several of the staff would openly talk about and complain about passengers within hearing distance of the passengers themselves.

The two legs to HKG and ORD were fine, in fact, I arrived a hour ahead of schedule in ORD, giving me a comfortable 3 hours transit. The incoming aircraft for my connection ORD-DTW came in a hour late, and by then we were caught in the storm and flights were grounded. We boarded the aircraft twice, and were told to deplane. Eventually the flight was cancelled. A 3:50pm flight to get me from ORD to DTW, I was still in ORD at 930pm. I can't get my checked bag as there is no procedure for that, and it will be on the next flight out to my final destination. We were given discounted hotel coupons, and I was rebooked on a 4:07pm flight the following day. As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues! My bag actually arrived at Detroit earlier than I did, and I had to make a trip to the Detroit airport to get it. My woes didn't end. 10 days later, I was going to get back to Singapore from Reagan (DCA-ORD-HKG-SIN). At Reagan, I couldn't check-in, because my entire itinerary was cancelled. I didn't get a reason for the cancellation, and got rebooked on the same itinerary. Alright never mind that I have middle seat for all 20 hours flight. At ORD, I tried to see if there are other seats available at the gate, and the staff was very rude, and unhelpful. ""There are only middle seats available, what do you expect me to do?"". She did not even try to look at my tickets. If she had, she would have seen that I got rebooked on economy plus, and telling me that would have made me feel better about the 15 hours flight. Onboard the plane, I was lucky, and only the aisle seat on the row behind me was occupied, and I was able to have a restful flight on a window seat. Why was the staff at the gate not willing to even look at my ticket? She didn't even look at her screen to check. ",1united-airlines,20/06/15,"This was very much a bare boned flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. At the last minute, as part of the closing doors announcement, the flight attendant announced that entertainment was only available through the United app, which she stated should be downloaded while we were on the ground. I'm fairly certain there was a charge for the entertainment, plus a charge for the necessary wifi connection. The premium economy was okay. It did have extra legroom and more recline (my big issue) than regular economy seats, but the width was barely adequate. And the aisles seem to have gotten narrower since I last flew on a plane. The only food available was for sale. It felt like the old time trains with someone hawking food and drinks throughout the trip.",3united-airlines,20/06/15,"The boarding was ordered. The airplane was shabby with extensive signs of wear and tear. The seat was dirty and sticky, but relatively comfortable. No PTV. Asked for the advertised sparkling wine but was told they don't have it and instead was given cheap white wine in minuscule plastic glass. Twenty minutes after boarding we were told that there is mechanical problem with the aircraft and were told to go to customer service. Since it was almost midnight, there was only 1 customer service representative for almost 300 passengers. Called their call center and was given last seat on the last flight departing LAX this night. It was economy middle seat in the rear part of the aircraft. Missed my connection to CMH in ORD. Customers service in ORD is awful. Representatives are not competent and are arrogant. Was told by one representative that no flight to CMH available today. When insisted (I am a Gold Premier) they found me seat on American flight but told me that I need to pay 374$ for this 50 min flight. I refused, and asked them to put me on the next available flight which was departing 12 h later. They refused to give me a hotel voucher or meal voucher. I went to customer service in the terminal 3 and they gave seat on flight that was scheduled to depart 8 h later but put me on the waiting list.

United Airlines have some catching up to do if they can.",4united-airlines,20/06/15,"As a loyal United Airlines customer, with Global Service status for years, that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant; however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with Unitedâ€™s â€œCustomer Careâ€ù team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengersâ€™ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with â€œCustomer Careâ€ù leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldnâ€™t it have been nice to receive a message stating â€œThank you again for continued business and patience, we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience, reimbursement for the incurred expenses, and credit of the earned milesâ€ù ? ",1united-airlines,19/06/15,"Domestic First Class/International Business Class, ORD-EWR-MXP. Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical â€˜old Unitedâ€™ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served â€“ no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average. Economy Plus on UA is still great value but I am starting to avoid United when flying on an expensive ticket or an itinerary requiring connections.",3united-airlines,19/06/15,"Previously we flew United to the US in August 2015 - Sydney to SFO, SFO to LAX, then LVG to Sydney via SFO. No problems, no delays, no cancellations. This past May we flew again to the US with United. I have to admit that this time I was concerned as I had read many bad reviews about the airline. We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX. However that said the pilot was able to make up time in the air and we actually landed early in LAX and easily made our connecting flight to New York.

Boeing 737-900 Like most U.S. carriers = the flight attendants are average at best! They spend most of their time socializing with each other and not providing service to passengers.

We pushed back 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin crew have been particularly attentive, efficient, and friendly. Beverage and meal service were quick. My only complaint is with the new economy drink and meal service. Although the inflight menu continues to list sparkling wine as available for purchase, the reality is that in economy, champagne is not to be had for love nor money.

The airline reps were telling us that there is no space to put any carry on baggage. We begged them to allow at least 1 small carry on baggage instead of 4 carry on bags as we are international passengers and they refused it. They were so rude. They even threaten to call police, if we don't follow their instruction to check in the carry on bags. They were even forcing us to reschedule our international travel to with our carry on baggage.

On the way there, at DCA, there were two agents for about 150 people waiting to go on various flights. It took us a good 45 minutes to get through ticketing and baggage. We missed a connection because the
crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before, so we were forced to take one at 8am, which meant waking at 4.30 am.

Avoid flying United if at all possible.",1united-airlines,14/06/15,"We booked together, we flew together from Brussel to Newark and now we fly back tomorrow and I wanted to check in online. I am going mad. I am flying with my son and we have seats 40k and 43b. I can choose another seat but it costs 100 dollar per person. In this review I can choose travelling as a couple - we will see.",1united-airlines,14/06/15,Arrived in Anchorage to find out our that flight was delayed 4 hours and that would cause us to not have any connecting flights at all in Houston to New Orleans. For the four of us traveling they could not get us on any other airlines to come home either. We tried to get at least one person on a flight to New Orleans to get our vehicle but nothing. Finally got a flight to Lafayette 2 hrs away and we had to rent a car at the airport to go and get out vehicle and drive back to our destination. Not the way we wanted to end our vacation. Especially since we were suppose to be home since 8.45 in morning only 15 hours after leaving it ended up taking us 23 hours of traveling in total.,1united-airlines,13/06/15,"This is the worse airline I have had the misfortune to fly. We have flown all over the world and this was both the worst planes and customer service in the world. Our first flight arrived in Newark, NJ. After being delayed over an hour we had to rush to the next gate and the flight was cancelled. With no notice and not even an agent there to give us further information we had to argue to get info and then get a hotel for the night. So there goes one more day. Then the second flight gets cancelled and we were stranded for another night and still no assistance. So now another day wasted day of our 4 day weekend vacation.",1united-airlines,13/06/15,"I'm in the military and I travel a lot, if I had a choice of airlines to use it would not be United. Delays are a norm because of maintenance, luggage lost is all too common. To be frank I am getting to the point that I would rather spend money out of my pocket and use another airline especially when it pertains to flights home. If the military wants to use the chespest airline fof my inbound travel thats fine but not my family time. I'm going to spend up to 200 bucks out of my own pocket to not use United on return flights",1united-airlines,13/06/15,"We were very disappointed with the service onboard our United Airlines flight from Toronto to Sydney. Changes to our departure times were text to our phones while we were already at the airport. Ground crew were dismissive of passengers who asked them any questions and were more interested in personal discussions than getting their job done. The cabin crew were very underwhelming and not accommodating passenger requests, to the point where you were not allowed a second cup of coffee because they had cleaned up and put everything away. The inflight entertainment cut out for our side of the plane and crew were not interested in doing anything about it. After 4 resetting attempts, the screens worked again. This being our second flight in 7 days we were expecting a little more enthusiasm and pride in their work from crew members. Being seated in economy class and not up the front meant that by the time our meals were served they had run out of popular items and we were left without a choice. No apology from crew, we were met with there's none left and this is what you can have. No attempt to salvage the situation at all and since this was a 14 hour flight, it was a long time without food. Of course, we were welcome to purchase an assortment of onboard snacks at very inflated prices. We will not be travelling with United again as this has not been a pleasant experience at all. We did not get cheap fares and felt that they need to make an effort to encourage passengers to fly with them again.",2united-airlines,13/06/15,"I'm a performer and I flew from Australia to LA without a hitch on another airline and then all the domestic flights I needed to catch were with United. I got five different flights whilst I was in the states and every single one of them were below standard and just absolutely disgusting. 4 of those flights were cancelled. The
staff were rude and inconsiderate, on flight 3 that ended up being cancelled I was sitting on the plane for hours and hours and was refused even a glass of water. If I ever travel back to America I will make sure I will never fly with such an inconsiderate company.",1united-airlines,13/06/15,"UA 1615, June 9, EWR to SJU.  I am a Star Alliance Gold Member but that made little difference except for the use of the United Lounge in EWR.  On-line check-in did not allow seat change and request for aisle seat resulted in row 32 way in the back of the 737-800. Flight was 40 minutes late due to mechanical problems in the flight deck
(lights) and then a passenger table tray.  Flight attendants did bare minimum with one bar service and then water was only available in back galley for the remainder of the 4 hour flight.  United really a disappointment.  Have had better treatment on American and Delta airlines with no status.",2united-airlines,13/06/15,"Flew TPA-IAD-LHR on 1 June, the first day of United's new enhanced economy transatlantic product. The flight from Tampa to Washington was a delight - friendly crew and punctual departure and arrival. Boarding on 918 was completed 15 minutes before scheduled departure, and then we waited. Weather in the DC area delayed us 3 hours,
the captain kept us informed and the crew distributed water and snacks. UA lived up to its promise - beer and wine were complimentary. Lamentably for me, sparkling wine which used to be available for purchase, was not to be had for love or money in economy. The new chef-inspired meals left me unimpressed.

We were kept at SFO in a customer service line for 3 hours with approx 300 other dissatisfied customers. Most were given an airline blanket and toothbrush and told to sleep in the airport and sorry for the luck.  A few
were provided with hotel vouchers.  I was one of them as the 30 minute flight I needed to take was booked for 24 hours later with $7 per person meal credit for the entire 24 hours.  The airline refused to proved refunds for anything stating all refunds must process through united.com and that nobody working could approve them.  I asked to be booked on a flight that was 9 hours earlier but was told the flight was already overbooked and this was impossible.  Went online to discover there were 5 open seats on the earlier flight called customer service and was told flight was booked.  I told them I was looking at the seat map avail with 5 open seats.  They reluctantly booked me on the earlier flight after an hour on the phone.  I had paid for economy plus seating which I did not get and I was not refunded the difference of $120 for 2 seats.  Horrible experience, terrible customer service! ",1united-airlines,12/06/15,"I flew with United from Chicago to TPA and enjoyed the flight. On time departure and arrival. Seats had decent legroom.

",8united-airlines,07/06/15,Flight from Washington DC to Rome and return flight Rome to Newark: The flight attendants were absolutely fantastic. The food on the flight from D.C. to Rome was a little better than the return flight but the food was more than acceptable. The seats were comfortable and a luxury to be able to stretch out and relax. The entertainment was great. There were many TV programs and movies to pick from for everyone's taste. Boarding and disembarkation was a breeze. Our baggage was on time.,10united-airlines,06/06/15,"I've been commuting between RDU to EWR for the past few months. As a loyal Delta flyer I transitioned over to United because they offer direct flights into Newark. What I've learned - you pay double the price for United as opposed to other airlines for delays and cancellations due to ""flight crew availability"". I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges. As far as recommending United - use at your own risk and be prepared to have a Plan B C and D for when your cancelled due to lack of availability of flight crew.",1united-airlines,06/06/15,6am flight was delayed until 7am which made us 10 minutes late for our connecting flight and they wouldn't even keep the gates open for us when they knew our flight was late. The next available flight was at 7.45pm. we got put on standby for a 12.45pm and a 3.00pm flight and couldn't get in on those. So we patiently waited for our 7.45pm flight then that flight got cancelled. We then proceeded to customer service and they said they couldn't do anything for us. Couldn't even pay for a hotel for us even though the next flight they could put us on was 3.30pm the next day. Do not fly United they do not try to work with you and they are very inconsiderate.,1united-airlines,06/06/15,"On May 22 2015 I flew from Newark to San Diego on a United B737-800/900 aircraft. This was the second leg of a flight home from Europe. The plane is fairly new and it is one of the most uncomfortable planes that I have ever been on. And that includes the medium and smaller commuter jets. This was a six hour flight. I booked this flight seven months in advance paid extra for the economy plus seating and selected a bulkhead isle seat in row 8 which was behind the ""first class"" section of the plane. However between the ""first class"" section of this plane and my row is what can marginally be called a restroom. It was a six hour flight and this tiny bathroom with a sink barely big enough to wash your hands was in constant use. Each time the bathroom door was swung open and closed those of us in the adjoining rows were assaulted with bathroom smells. After a few hours in the air I noticed that the bathroom smells were more intense and that the floor next to the bathroom door was wet. I spoke to the purser who jumped up and immediately locked the bathroom door and took it out of service. That was a good temporary fix. However I would like to suggest to United that they consider removing that toilet unit from this plane configuration. It really ruins the flight for those stuck in seats close by. Also this plane has hard vinyl seats and headrests and no entertainment screens. The seats on Southwest are more comfortable. This would all be OK for short haul flights but planes like this are too uncomfortable for cross country flights.",3united-airlines,06/06/15,28th May UA flight # 927 from Frankfurt to San Francisco got cancelled due to security check lapses by the airline. After four hours on the tarmac passengers were off loaded for a replacement flight next day. Those without German visas were not given any facilities to sleep at the airport - no pillows or blankets. We spent an uncomfortable night on airport chairs. Staff complained that they were working overtime and too tired to help passengers. A couple of the ground staff slipped away before answering our queries. This is a terrible airline to get stranded with. No care for customers. Never again will I travel UA.,1united-airlines,06/06/15,Flex regular economy on LAX-IAD-LAX coast-to-coast on B737-800 on redeye outbound then B737-900 on return.

On return flight plain jane seat but service was prompt and plenty of free soda provided. A step up from Southwest but that's about it.,6united-airlines,04/06/15,On April 20th we flew from HNL-LAX the flight left around noon. From the beginning there was a noticeable lack of service at the airport a very casual approach to almost being a big yawn. We boarded a very crowded old Boeing 757 it was scruffy dirty and the flight crew even scruffier. We had paid for Economy Plus and a bulkhead all added extra's happy to pay when the service is provided in this case the seats were so narrow it was hideous the galley to our right was occupied most of time by a flight attendant who was more interested in himself than anything else the rest of the crew appeared very uninterested even the First Class crew could not smile. The continual line for the restrooms required us to keep moving our legs never again. We were showered in ice cubes from the galley twice I ordered a cocktail to help keep me calm $14 AUD for a drink such a rip off it was basically thrown at me. What has happened to United? We vowed never to fly with them again now here comes the kicker we had a return from LAX-HNL in late May a 777-200 lovely aircraft two roomy seats on the side in Economy Plus and some of the most charming flight crew I have met. I talking an older crew they offered superb service with a smile I told them they had restored my faith in United for which I received great thanks and was told they were called the originals. Flights on time and the return cocktail were much less expensive.,7united-airlines,04/06/15,"I was travelling from Orlando to Anchorage with a connection in Houston and San Francisco. When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the ""water leak"" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use. Needless to say this made for some pretty incredulous passengers.",4united-airlines,01/06/15,May 29 Beijing to Washington then Washington to New York and then Toronto. UA 808 UA 4001 AC727. United is by far the worst airline I have had the misfortune of being on. Of the two intercontinental flights I have taken with United all of them have involved a major delay (flight being cancelled or rescheduled to next day with a distress hotel room) or losing your luggage for days. United staff are also some of the rudest people I have had the misfortune of interacting with. The entire airline seems to take delight in punishing their customers for having the nerve to travel. Even though their airfares are low only take this airline if you enjoy spending your vacation time in airports or dealing with surly staff who seem to delight in making customers' lives hell.,1united-airlines,01/06/15,"This was my first time to fly Domestic First Class on United Airlines. My first thoughts were how the cabin service reminded me of what economy class once was when I flew as a teenager in the late 1970's. This trip was from SEA to ORD to IND and back. Zone 1 boarding: Great! Initial cabin greeting was pleasant and prompt. Seat comfort good. Seat pitch a bit tight. Drink and snack service: very good. Flight Attendants: If I ran my own airline I would hire each attendant that I encountered on this trip. Meal service was good no complaints. Inflight entertainment: On the outbound trip there seemed to be a good selection that I could watch no charge on my own device. Connectivity needs to be simplified! On the return part of my trip the equipment was Inop. This is the second US carrier that I've encountered with Inop inflight equipment. United you need to spend more time making sure your equipment works. ""Just Good Enough"" is not good enough!",8united-airlines,01/06/15,Flight to St Louis from Houston cancelled at night due to 'rain' so I had to get a room at my own expense as did hundreds of others finding a hotel took over an hour. Before leaving the Houston airport to my room I booked tickets to get me to St Louis the next day. Here is where United incompetence took over. Ticket was Houston to Tulsa Tulsa to St. Louis. When I got to Tulsa I ask why the flight from Tulsa to St Louis would take over 4 hours answer: you are going through Chicago but you won't have to leave the plane! Got to Chicago told that plane was not going to St. Louis went to desk asking where was my flight to St Louis flight and when answer: the St Louis flight just left I can put you on standby on the next flight! Got to gate and asked for standby update told here would be one standby seat available as one passenger was not going to make the departure time I was not to worry about getting on the standby position was mine. When it came time for stand by to board another person's name was called. Went back to the desk asking why I was not the standby person answer: she has more status! Then when names were announced who had seats but had not boarded my name was called. Went back to desk asking if I had a seat answer: oh is that you? Yes you have a seat! If I ever fly United again it will be out of desperation not by choice.,1united-airlines,31/05/15,Terrible service provided by the flight attendant. Unfortunately I had fallen asleep when the drinks were being served and when I asked the flight attendant for water she just kept on walking. I pushed the call button and as she was serving the water she sarcastically asked whether there was an emergency to which I responded that I felt almost dehydrated and her unbelievably rude answer was that I could have got up to get the water myself. It's bad enough that the airline doesn't serve any food at no charge anymore but to top it off their in-flight service has got much worse. I didn't pay $60 for this international flight it was much more!,6united-airlines,31/05/15,"My wife and I took United for our honeymoon to Hawaii. United fails to inform you that you need to download their app in advance to enjoy any sort of entertainment inflight.

For those who do not or do not have a compatible device bring your own entertainment. Upon calling to check in on our return we learned the flight had been cancelled. While they had my email address on file the only notification came through a text message. However this text didn't inform us of anything but merely asked us to ""text yes"" to the text to receive subsequent messages. Assuming this was just another airline phishing attempt I ignored the message. While they knew I was not aware of the change no call attempt or email attempt was made. Overall I satisfied.",3united-airlines,28/05/15,I arrived at the check-in counter 40+ minutes to departure. The attendant called the gate to see if the flight was delayed but they said it wasn't. I received this notification immediately after. United flight UA1246 on April 26 is delayed due to a late inbound aircraft arrival. Now departs: 2.00 pm). Hence I cannot check in my luggage. No worries I will throw all my liquids away and carry it on. Ultimately I gate checked one bag. Once the entire flight was boarded the pilot immediately stated we were going to be delayed and probably shouldn't have boarded the flight. We land 15-20 minutes late and we sit on the tarmac for another 10 minutes because our gate is taken. This is a common occurrence flying into IAH. The straw that broke the camel's back - zero communication and no empathy for every passenger that checked luggage. After everything else we had to wait about an hour to get our luggage. 4 planes on one belt and we were the 4th in line while only half of the belts were occupied.,1united-airlines,27/05/15,Our flight from Las Vegas to Charleston South Carolina took 28 hours. The first plane from Vegas to Houston was delayed because of mechanical problems. The connecting flight was delayed because of a pilot timing out. We paid for two hotels because one was prepaid in Charleston and we needed to sleep before our morning flight to Charleston. The morning flight was changed because of a tire problem and again because of communications problems. We were offered 2500 points or $50 toward our next a United flight.,1united-airlines,22/05/15,I had booked a trip to Hong Kong through Flight Network. on the way there (14 hour flight) the plane did not have any entertainment units or even a plug in for a laptop. On our way back we were to go from Hong Kong to San Francisco and then from San Francisco to Edmonton. United Airlines had switched the connecting flight to go through Chicago instead of San Francisco which I only found out when checking in on our departure day. The attendant at the United desk was unable to provide an explanation as to why the connection was switched and was basically of no help. This ended up amounting to a 9 hour delay and me missing a day at work.,1united-airlines,22/05/15,Recently flew from West Palm Beach to Austin VIA Houston. The flight from Houston to Austin was on a brand new regional jet with nine first class seats. Unfortunately several sensors were showing and everyone needed to exit the plane. Within 30 minutes another new regional plane with the same configuration was waiting a few gates away and the plane was only 45 minutes late getting into Austin. Good job United. Unfortunately returning was a different story. I arrived at the Austin airport several hours early and inquired about an earlier flight to Houston. I was told that there had been no late flights all day. The plane arrived in Austin late and by the time I boarded it was 30 minutes late. Then it began raining in Houston so the plane had to wait another 20 minutes in Austin. By the time the plane arrived in Houston my flight to West Palm Beach had left and it was the last flight of the day. Most passengers on the full A319 flying east had to find a hotel for the night at their own expense because United is not responsible for weather related delays and it is usually raining somewhere where United flies. The next afternoon I was on an old regional plane with no first class seats to West Palm Beach.,3united-airlines,20/05/15,Just returned from a round trip from London to Washington then New York San Francisco and finally Cancun and return.

UA 55 Paris-Newark April 18 2015. After United bought Continental everything went downhill. Flights were delayed or cancelled they routinely have mechanical problems with their planes their flight crews have gotten worse and worse to the point that they often are just plain abusive their overseas business class is terrible and their ground crews are incompetent dishonest and often nasty. Unfortunately they have so many direct routes that you are stuck either flying United or taking another airline with a stop midway through your flight. If you have frequent flier miles with them good luck. You can almost never use your miles when you want to travel over the holidays or they charge some exorbitant number of miles. And now your miles will expire if you don't continue to fly with these people. United Airlines is a nightmare.,1united-airlines,20/05/15,My husband and I travelled from Newark NJ to Dubai with a stop over at Washington-Dulles. Newark flight was delayed and our Washington Dulles connection was missed. It took from 10 pm to 12.30 am to get to a customer service agent at Washington-Dulles where we stood in line for two and a half hours. Agents took an average of 15 to 20 minutes per customer.,1united-airlines,16/05/15,UA 895 4/11/15 UA 99 5/2/15. In my job I average 175k miles of travel a year primarily with UA and their Star Alliance partners. As a 1K I enjoy personalized attention with UA such as automatic rebooking on cancelled flights or missed connections. I fly coach but with my status I frequently get upgrades domestically. Although I'm qualified for 6 global upgades a year that hasn't happened since 2010 when both my wife and SIL received Business Class seats MUC-ORD (prior to the merger with Continental). Unfortunate but could be a sign of the health of the economy that those seats are being purchased. At any rate I am very happy with the service I get from UA and even though I live near ORD I have had very few cancellations or delays of significance flying in or out of Chicago. Prices are competitive and schedules are great making it very easy to co-ordinate travel to Asia or Europe. While I fly Delta and SkyTeam partners occasionally I will fly UA and partners if at all possible. Most recent travel was 747-400 ORD-HKG outbound to Taiwan and MEL-LAX (787-9) and LAX-ORD (757) homebound.,10united-airlines,16/05/15,United improbably informed us two days in advance that our flight from Albuquerque to Denver connecting to Minneapolis would most likely be delayed? Good to their word they got us to Denver an hour and a half late missing our connection maintenance issues was the reason. We had managed to rebook our connection in Albuquerque the agent assuring us our luggage would remain in Denver. Now it's 10pm no luggage and waiting in line with approximately 400 people to get to one service desk. 2 Hours later we have a hotel voucher and nothing else talked to some low level manager who couldn't understand why 2 full fare first class customers were upset after all we got a free hotel room.,1united-airlines,13/05/15,We recently flew the Dreamliner from Melbourne to LA with 3 of our sons. We have flown United before on the old 747's. the Dreamliner is just beautiful great inflight entertainment larger windows which you can control making it darker with the touch of a button very friendly and happy staff always makes the 14 hour flight a lot more pleasant. The food was really good and the beverages were a good selection not too sure about paying for a beer when most other international airlines include that in the fare.

I've always flied United but from now on I will make sure I get a Lufthansa flight when traveling to Germany!,1united-airlines,12/05/15,"I had the worst experience on United Airlines today. I was told I couldn't board the plane with my 4 month old infant because of weight restrictions on the plane. 6 people were told they couldn't board the plane including myself and I found out that was based on our fares. I was penalized because I planned ahead and booked my ticket for less money. It doesn't matter that I started my trip hours earlier or that I connected and arrived to the gate on time. Some kind soul did try to volunteer their seat. I overhead the gate crew saying there was a mother and baby who should board next which was superseded by the supervisor who said full fares trump everything. I left my house at 4.45am to catch a flight to connect to Chicago so I could get to my destination in the shortest time possible with a sleeping baby. I am a frequent flier a ""MileagePlus Explorer"" (which I pay for by having a premium credit card) yet here I am - the only person with a child on my plane-prevented from boarding because my $554 fare wasn't enough to get me my reserved seat.

Our flight was cancelled due to weather in our connecting city so we had to stay over an extra day but United was helpful and upgraded us to premium economy.

I would recommend United Airlines.,10united-airlines,11/05/15,UA 937 I had not flown in a 767 in a long time and I travel a lot. The plane was old and dirty and the flight attendants were old and fat. They never smiled or greeted you - clearly hate their jobs. The announcements were like the ones you hear in school. Don't do this don't do that - militant. I had booked a Swiss flight I thought. The inflight entertainment and food were very poor compared to other airlines. No water bottles given out just cups. Cheap. The toilets were smelly and there was no amenity kit you see in other airlines. United complains about the open skies but they could never compete with Emirates or Qatar with such old planes and unattractive staff.,1united-airlines,11/05/15,United Airlines is the worst airline I have flown with. After waiting an hour in line to check in I get to the counter and find out it was two late to board my flight. This was after getting up at 3 am in the morning just be sure I was there ahead of time. There is no excuse for their incompetence. They spent my valuable time chatting with one another amongst themselves at the counter and not warning anyone in line that there was a danger missing there flight or even showing effort to work faster. They did not attempt to even try make amends. Do not fly United out of Rochester NY they are the most unprofessional workers I have seen in this industry.,1united-airlines,11/05/15,Recent flight from Hawaii to LA 6 hours. Beverage offered when first boarded no other beverage or food offered through out the entire flight. Disgusted as over night flight and not even breakfast or tea or coffee.

That said the flight I was on from Dublin IR to IAD on a United 757 was excellent. We were in premium economy which made a huge difference on a 7+ hour flight. We had two hot meals (full + snack) three full beverage services and at least 3 or 4 juice/water services. I was dreading a narrow body long haul flight but United did it right. A most pleasant surprise in this age of travel misery.,9united-airlines,06/05/15,"I booked our family of (3's) flight months in advance all seats were requested together and I prefer sitting next to the window because it seems to help my severe motion sickness. Per experience I usually allow a 90-120 min layover if I have a connecting flight which if you fly out of Pittsburgh it is almost impossible to get straight through flights unless you fly Southwest where unless you are a bouncer you cannot get a window seat to save your life. The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on 'mechanical delay'. The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening. United should have contacted the gate to let them know we were on our way should have made arrangements for a cart for the disabled passenger in order to get us there in a timely manner. This one simple communication act would have taken less than 1 minute.",2united-airlines,04/05/15,SFO-IAH return. Both flights delayed for a variety of reasons. Air travel in the US is becoming such a hassle with rude and paranoid TSA lesser flights packed planes and crowded skies. Ground and air staff friendly and helpful. Free DirecTV as a result of the delays on both legs. I'd avoid flying if there was an alternative mode (perhaps the US should invest in a bullet train?). So frustrating.,5united-airlines,04/05/15,While traveling to Christchurch N.Z from Richland WA. on Flight 833 April 23rd we learned there were gale force winds and rain of up to 55 miles an hour around Sydney Australia. We were forced to travel on to Melbourne where we waited on the tarmac for 2 hours until we knew whether we could disembark. It turned out that we did all go into the airport and then were given lunch vouchers. We waited 3-4 hours and then got back on our plane bound for Sydney. I checked to see if I could catch a flight from Melbourne to Christchurch but was told by a UA attendant that there were no more flights to Christchurch from Melbourne I was given a motel voucher for a night's stay and continued on to Christchurtch via NZ Airlines the next day. All in all everything was handled well flight attendants gave extra cookies we were updated frequently about what was to transpire and I think all the passengers were happy that our safety was the most important thing to the crew.,9united-airlines,02/05/15,Ditching United and my mileage credit card after this next flight finally departs. Pittsburgh to Newark in United flown by Republic. Last weeks 'maintenance' delay of 45mins should have been enough of a red flag along with overhearing the air stewardess complaining to senior ground staff that did they really have to fly in such an old plane. Tonight sitting with another 'maintenance' delay of 2.5hrs+ on last flight of a Friday night to get home to family - would have been quicker for me to drive the 5.5hrs door to door. A leaving customer.,1united-airlines,01/05/15,MCO-IAD Flight 1731. IAD-MCO Flight 1133. They are always delayed on flights then they ask customers if they are checking in any bags. They charge $25 if you say yes however if you take your luggage on the flight then they tell customers that it's free. This has delayed our flight several times and it's completely a rip-off! Not to mention that they changed our seats last min without notifying us until last min.,1united-airlines,01/05/15,SAN-ORD-BRU AMS-IAH-SAN in economy plus. Flights on time service friendly and professional food decent IFE good planes clean and in good order and baggage arrived with me. United even e-mailed to inform me of a 24 hour transportation strike upon my arrival in Brussels with an offer to change my trip with no fee. Nice but wasn't necessary. No complaints.,9united-airlines,01/05/15,We had a large group flying from all over the United States to Cancun for my daughters wedding. Every single person flying United had issues! My son's flight was cancelled due to no pilot. United then put him his wife and 4 yr old son on another flight. They had to fly from San Diego to Washington DC then to Cancun to make matters worse the weren't even seated near each other!!! How can they do that with a 4 yr old. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed my flight because it took over 1.5 hrs just to check my bag and then was treated horribly. When we finally got on they plane the flight attendants were not friendly whatsoever and United in their ultimate wisdom decided that 7 meals would be sufficient for this 5hr 50 min flight. I fly at least 4-5 times a year and usually enjoy it. I will never fly United again. It was a nightmare.,1united-airlines,01/05/15,This is the second time I have flown United and it will be the last. The first time all the planes were late and we kept getting bumped to later flights. When we did arrive the luggage did not and it took four days to get the luggage. The second time I flew first class. After we checked in in Toronto we were put into a large area like cattle with no services and then lined up and herded through customs at the last minute so we were unable to get breakfast or buy magazines etc. one bag did not arrive with us but went to Newark instead of San Francisco. On the way home I was bumped to a different seat so I was no longer flying with my spouse and when I called I was told that is just how they roll and even in first class full fare seat booking are suggestions. In the future I will be flying Delta. We flew Delta last year and it was a much different experience.,4united-airlines,01/05/15,UA1122 23 April 2015 MCO-EWR. UA1690 26 April 2015 EWR-MCO. Flew United First from Orlando to Newark return. Crew very friendly attentive and interested in the passengers onboard. Service by both LAX based crew from Orlando and Newark based crew back was excellent. Drinks always refilled and never any empty glasses or trash around they always cleared it away. Food was brilliant and very tasty. The 757-200 on both sectors was clean tidy and all features of the business first cabin in good working order. The actual aircraft used had the international business first cabin which was a nice bonus with the fully lie flat bed. Over all will definitely be using United again over other carriers.,10united-airlines,01/05/15,I have never flown United Airlines before. This will be my first and last time. Our family booked our flights in January from San Diego to Florida. Sometime in February the flight time of our second leg of the flight was changed by about 5 minutes. Didn't think much about it. Just yesterday my daughter was checking her seating arrangements and realized that when United changed the second leg of the flight they dropped all our seats. There are no seats available. No help from the United reservation person who I could barely understand. We're all sitting apart. Good thing we checked our seating or we might not even had a seat. I will never fly this airline again and I haven't even been on the plane yet.,4united-airlines,30/04/15,It's unbelievable that United continues to use ageing Boeing 747's on transpacific flights. 747's don't even have monitors behind the seats in economy class! Very disappointing when you can't choose what to watch on an 11 hour flight! In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled. I've never received such a response on Asian airlines. Will definitely avoid flying United in the future if I can help it.,3united-airlines,28/04/15,I was flying from Ft Lauderdale to Houston this evening in premium class. I was carrying a tote bag small purse a tiny rollerboard and a shopping bag. The guy taking my tickets in a hostile tone told me only two items. I have flown continental for years. Husband was platinum level. This was never an issue so of course I moved aside to comply and consolidated four into two plus purse. Purse an issue so gate checked bag. Fine. Got on board. To add insult to injury. Weather delay due to lightening and hail in Florida and major storm system in Houston area. I had had my United flight diverted last week. We had option to get off the carrier and I elected to get off. I asked rude gate agent if I could retrieve checked bag. No he said rudely. I will never fly them again.,1united-airlines,24/04/15,I took a trip from London out to Rio De Janeiro and from there to Sydney and back home after another stop over in Rio. My travel started on April 1st on UA 5 from London to Houston. I'm a 1k and upgraded this whole itinerary of about 48000 miles of travel from economy to business using mileage and a cash fee. All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule. There are airlines out there that could not even come close to this level of punctuality. And as always my baggage appeared in the right place at the right time. United continues to provide generally very good service in my experience.,8united-airlines,24/04/15,BCN-EWR. United gets dumped on so much here I wanted to say something nice. Our trip was near-perfect. The flight was full yet the staff were friendly attentive prompt and accommodating in all ways. Very good filling and nutritious lunch plus a pre-landing hot snack. Seating in the Boeing 757-200 was spacious and comfortable. (We sat in their Economy Plus which offered plenty of leg room and I'm six feet tall.) Entertainment was plentiful and varied (I watched three recent movies I had missed in theatres) and the viewing screen was quite large enough. Overall the trip was so relaxing that we still had energy for the final two-hour leg home EWR- ORD which also was quite pleasant.,9united-airlines,22/04/15,I flew from Dulles Washington to London Heathrow on the 7th April 2014 although I was in economy it was the best flight I have experienced I usually sit at the window when I fly but this time I opted for the aisle - it does make life so much easier when flying. Anyway although I was in economy the service was first class the cabin crew were excellent its nice to be looked after by cabin crew with a genuine smile rather than a false grin. The free television on the back of the seat is also a nice addition anyway thanks united for a great trip.,10united-airlines,19/04/15,My wife and I travelled business class Sydney to Tampa Florida via LAX. Sadly a passenger died two hours of Sydney so had to return. Told flight was rescheduled for the next day. As we live in Sydney on the fringe we were told to go home and come back tomorrow. Cab fares were $240 with no reimbursement. Next day plane was an hour late boarding. Business Class cabin carpets were soaking wet. Further delay to clean. Cheap sparkling wine served in plastic cup. Departed Charleston SC sixteen days later back to Sydney via Chicago and LAX. As no internationally trained staff at UA Charleston could only ship bags to Chicago thus to baggage collection/security there. Airline lounge packed in Chicago. At LAX UA lounge was so full we were not allowed in. Then found out no frequent flyer points Sydney-LAX because it was an unscheduled flight.,1united-airlines,19/04/15,I flew from IAH to NRT. Not the worst flight but many aspects could be greatly improved. Too much air- conditioning I had to have 3 blankets to keep myself warm. The IFE was better than I expected though. Some acceptable selections to watch. It kept me entertained for the 12 hour flight. Overall probably taking another airline is a better choice for your trip.,5united-airlines,19/04/15,On a flight from LAX to New Orleans. Flight 1/2 full with all exit rows empty. My husband and I attempted to move to a exit row seat and was told by the flight attendant we could not move. You have to pay to sit in an exit row. The flight is half empty. United this is our last time fly with you!,1united-airlines,19/04/15,PBI-IAH-LAX-NRT-SIN - original scheduled route. Route actually flown with delays: PBI-IAH-LAX-SFO-HND-SIN. All domestic flights offered only beverages or you could purchase food. Flight delayed due to weather in IAH. Arrived into LAX and my connecting flight had left. Ground service was little to no help. Crew at gate barked to go to Customer service and they only deal with guests at that gate. Customer service had only one person to rebook flights for 40 folks waiting in line. Called 800 number and then was told to call another number to speak to someone about my international ticket. Finally got rebooked but it meant flying to SFO and then onto Singapore. Good part is my flight from Tokyo to Singapore were on ANA. There was a gate change while en-route to Japan. The ANA attendant met me at security to inform me of gate change and asked if I wanted a transport.,4united-airlines,19/04/15,"A recent flight from London to New York recently was perhaps the worst experience we've had. We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth. No problems with bags or leave time.",5united-airlines,17/04/15,Flew to Las Vegas from Amsterdam with a stop at Chicago. Were delayed at Chicago for 3.5 hours with no communication from United staff and 6 gate changes. Onboard entertainment system broke down after 2 hours (on our flight from Amsterdam to Chicago) so we had 6 hours where we had nothing to do but just sit. Flight crew was uninspired. Return flight from Las Vegas to Amsterdam got cancelled 15 minutes before we arrived at McCarran airport because there was no crew available. Eventually flew back to Amsterdam through Los Angeles with KLM. Customer care pointed at Reservations and Reservations pointed at Customer Care. Was on the phone (international call) for over an hour and just got disconnected. Several e-mail back and forth only thing United did was apologize for the inconvenience. Stay away from United.,1united-airlines,16/04/15,"Flew EWR-AMS-EWR earlier this month. Had extra legroom in Economy Plus. Boeing 757 was very comfortable. Food was surprisingly good. Their ""Asian Vegetarian"" option was a really nice Indian curry. Soft drinks coffee and tea are complimentary and are frequently offered throughout the flight. Crew on both sectors were accommodating and very pleasant. They made quite an effort to make sure we were well fed and hydrated. I was travelling with two very young children and the crew constantly came up to our row and checked in on us. It made us feel welcomed and relaxed. Great in-flight entertainment with lots of great video on demand. Would definitely fly with United again.",10united-airlines,14/04/15,I was very disappointed with the service and overall experience I received from this airline I had a flight out of Fort Lauderdale Airport at 7.45 am I had arrived early around 6 am with my 4 month old infant. We boarded the flight on time everything seemed to be going as planned until the flight was delayed due to some electrical in the control panel. We ended up sitting on this flight for a good 2 hours waiting as they kept saying sorry and we will update you more in 5 minutes and then 30 minutes and overall a 2 hour wait time until they said we are sorry but we must all exit the plane and wait in line until we could get booked for another flight. Once booked for a new flight they gave us food vouchers the new flight they booked me on was at 2.55pm it was only 11am so I was expected to wait with an infant for another 3 hours - a long day waiting me with my son. I then received a notification on my phone that the flight they rebooked me on had been delayed 90 minutes which would have meant being stuck in Houston airport where my connecting flight was but that I would have missed by the time the new flight had arrived. I was then put on another flight leaving Fort Lauderdale at 5.15pm and arriving to my destination at 11.18pm. I don't think that this was handled well at all especially since I was carrying a child around and had only me.,1united-airlines,14/04/15,Flight 1660 from Denver to Houston. This airline is horrible. If you have other options to fly to a location exercise the alternative and pay whatever it costs. Delayed 5 hours. Refused to hold connecting flight despite the fact that over 30 passengers were connecting via that flight. No discounts offered on flights. No ticket offers to fly at no expense in the future to another location. Absolutely horrible customer service. Rude and ineffective agents/representatives. A company that could not care less about customer service.,1united-airlines,12/04/15,ROC-ORD-JAC and JAC-ORD-ROC. Outbound flights went without a hitch. ORD-JAC segment in an A-320 with new slim seats. Seats were more comfortable than I thought they would be based on previous reviews. Flight Attendants pleasant and made several passes with water for a three hour flight. Return was delayed two hours in JAC. Not a problem for me as I had a 5 hour layover scheduled in ORD. Equipment was an A320 as well and the Flight Attendants were pleasant and attentive. I would give higher marks for seat comfort except both ROC-ORD and ORD-ROC segments were on a regional partner using an ERJ-145. Seating was cramped and the small cabin is not for those with claustrophobia. In all United gets you from point A to point B. They certainly aren't JetBlue.,3united-airlines,12/04/15,I've never actually been embarrassed to be seen travelling business class before. I met a colleague at the airport and I was wearing the same clothes for the past 2 days (they cancelled my flight and didn't return my luggage- later found out that they had reinstated the flight but didn't tell me). In front of us both I was told by a flight agent that the flight United had booked me on was full-they didn't even book the other flight! Now my rescheduled flight is delayed another 4 hours.,3united-airlines,12/04/15,Overbooked flights planes grounded for maintenance issues replacement aircraft with fewer seats. My flight out of Houston quickly fell apart as the original plane was both over-booked and grounded for maintenance issues. While waiting to find out if there were enough seats for everyone stragglers who had been bumped off previous flights were given seats over those who were actually assigned to the flight. Overall a very poorly executed attempt at damage control.,3united-airlines,10/04/15,LAX to MEL on new 787-9 Dreamliner. This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight. The plane was brand new with excellent Panasonic IFE with very clear screen USB and power at every seat Wi-Fi which worked well for the entire trip good food and polite service. This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX. The return flight arrives at TBT to clear customs so think it would be much improved experience if UA international flights could depart from TBT as well.,9united-airlines,10/04/15,Had over 3 hour delay for a flight from Chicago to San Diego. After a 1 1/3 hours they finally boarded the passengers and just as the last people were getting on they reassigned the flight crew. Had to wait another hour before a new crew showed up. Another delay because they need more fuel them once we were ready to go we had to delay again because we had to get a new flight attendant because one of them had been on for too long. Complete mismanagement by United.,1united-airlines,10/04/15,Travelled SYD-LAX-LAS and GCM-IAH-LAX-MEL and found the airline to be well above average. Whilst some of the aircraft are a little older the LAX-MEL leg was on the 787-8 and we were upgraded to premium economy (economy plus) for that leg - possibly the most comfortable flight I have ever been on. Flight attendants were typically very cheerful and despite the large amount of legs no complications with baggage. Food was fine entertainment on the long-haul flights was pretty good. In any respect they performed much above my expectations and don't deserve a lot of the bad rap they get on this site.,8united-airlines,10/04/15,I flew United from KIAD to DXB in economy and really liked it. I wasn't very optimistic about the airline when I read reviews on it but United surprised me with how good they were. The ticket was the cheapest I could find. I have flown on several different airlines and United served me one of the best meals I have ever had on a plane. The seats were big and comfortable since United has a good seat configuration. United uses a 3-3-3 seat configuration unlike many airlines that uses a 3-4-3 configuration on their Boeing 777's. The flight attendants were nice and helpful. The inflight entertainment was good with a lot of the latest movies and TV shows that kept me occupied the entire flight. I would recommend this airline to anyone.,10united-airlines,08/04/15,I flew from Paris to St Louis (MO) transit at Newark 3 hours flight delay from Newark to St Louis and 4 hours flight delay on the return flight from Newark to Paris. Reasons for delay: aircraft/crew not available plane maintenance etc. Food quantity absurd compared to other airlines. Avoid this airline even if it offers attractive prices it is not worth it.,1united-airlines,08/04/15,I flew to New Orleans from Toronto on Air Canada in business class on a cramped and ancient CRA jet which was very substandard compared to what it used to be and returned on United via Newark on a 320 Airbus which was surprisingly comfortable and superior to AC in every department and for nearly half the price than Air Canada charged for the outgoing trip. I will favour United over Air Canada in the future.,8united-airlines,08/04/15,Flight 839 Los Angeles to Sydney 4th April 2015. Departed LA near enough on time flight uneventful until approx 3/4 hr before landing. We were informed by the Captain that because of bad weather we were to be diverted to Brisbane. In Brisbane we were told to stay on the plane until further notice. With only minutes to spare before the cut off time for Pilots and Crew expired we approached the runway for our return to Sydney. We only got half way when the Captain announced we were not going to take off as their time had expired. We were taken off the plane and told to wait until a new crew could be found. Almost 12 hrs later and a frustrating lack of information we were told that finally they had a crew but no pilot then we had a pilot but due to administration problems we could not leave. After a 15hr flight and 12 hrs sitting in an Airport we were all tired and at the end of our resolve. We finally arrived in Sydney with a loud applause from all of us passengers 27 hrs later.,1united-airlines,06/04/15,I have taken several flights with United in the last 2 months (DEN-BOS-ORD-PHL-DEN and DEN-IAH). The online reviews are fairly awful but I have had overall decent to good experiences. All flights have arrived on time and early on a few occasions. Inflight service was overall good with smiling crews. Ground crews have also been reasonable good overall. I have found crews not based in EWR are in general a lot nicer. Inflight Internet worked well overall.,8united-airlines,06/04/15,My son and I recently had a connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City. When we got off the plane the board said our flight had been cancelled. When we asked why they customer service representative told us that our flight had been chosen at random because of the weather. We were told to either wait at the airport for 12 hours or we could pay for a motel. In my opinion the motel should be provided if the airline has the ability to just randomly cancel flights. What a major inconvenience. The customer service rep was very rude and unaccommodating. I'll never fly united again.,1united-airlines,06/04/15,UA1464. We flew from Palm Springs to San Francisco then from San Francisco to Calgary yesterday. Excellent flights connections and service.,10united-airlines,06/04/15,EWR-SJO-EWR. No-frills airline. All flights were on time but the seats were uncomfortable and cramped there was no free food in coach and the flight attendants were unpleasant and unprofessional. Ever since the merger service has declined and prices have gone up.,5united-airlines,06/04/15,"I made my reservation months in advance. I was supposed to have an aisle seat about 5 seats from the back of the plane. When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice. On the plus side it was terribly windy and the pilot did a good job with the landing.",1united-airlines,04/04/15,I booked a last minute trip from Orlando FL to Hong Kong. The price was OK for few days notice but the in-flight experience was one I would like to forget. In the past I flew overseas with other international airlines from abroad and most treated me and my family very good. With United it was my worst experience flying overseas. Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando. Got no sympathy from service desk and was stuck in Chicago for an extra 4 hours. I will not fly United ever again. Its not only bad service they provide but bad attitudes and they want to change you for every single little amenity. Avoid this airline if you can.,1united-airlines,04/04/15,BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring. I see no reason why I should not take United again.,7united-airlines,30/03/15,The flight is always too full for everyone's carry on baggage. I don't like having to make sure I'm first in line to get onboard just so I know I don't have to check my bag. I had to check my bag the last few trip and wait for an hour for it to come through after landing. I cannot believe they are now charging for inflight entertainment. It's one step too far.,3united-airlines,30/03/15,"ORD (Chicago) to OGG (Maui). They notified us that there would be no wi-fi on the flight. Fine. We had media- filled devices so we could tolerate the 9-hour flight. OGG to ORD wi-fi was 'available' but none of our devices (Android and iOS) would connect. Loading for the sign-in page would stop at 80% at the highest but then would hang. Forget about it. Take-off was delayed for loading of 'catering supplies' (food that would be sold to us?). Flight attendants are always rude as if clearly they would rather be doing something other than attending. Waving a hand for your trash dour faces curt language (""You need to [do this or that]."") All this for the privilege of a non-stop flight at an international price. Hello Alaska Airlines.",2united-airlines,30/03/15,"ORD (Chicago O'Hare) to OGG (Maui Kahului) round trip. To Maui it was announced that the flight (a B777) would not have wi-fi. Luckily we brought our own electronic devices loaded with media to watch or read on. On the way back wi-fi was available but none of our devices was able to connect (iOS and Android) stuck in ""sign in"" anywhere from 20% to 80%. The home-leg departure was delayed for loading of catering supplies (i.e. food that would be for sale?). Flight attendants are rude as if you were sitting in their furniture without asking. It's easy to use polite language and manners even if you're not sincere yet they could not muster a minimum effort. The price for this flight is quite high as much as ORD to an Asian destination but it seems more like a budget flight. I guess it's because it's a straight flight (no lay-overs). Next time I will try Alaska Air with one stop-over at a much lower price (less than half!).",1united-airlines,28/03/15,"My husband is a frequent flyer with United Airlines in his personal and business travels without incident. In saying that I am a reasonable person I can understand that our flight was delayed and then cancelled due to mechanical problem. However the rudeness of the ticket agents was a total shock to me and most of the other passengers. Staff did not seem to be equipped to handle helping people re-route their flights and were flustered and unprofessional. It is very difficult for me to express my disappointment in the way the situation was handled. The only apologies we received were from the airport security officers who showed up at gate 29. There were no announcements stating that they (the ticket agents) were going to help us with connecting flights there were no apologies for the inconvenience of having to sleep in the airport no announcement that first class passengers and those with small children would be found hotel rooms and others would be left to their own devices to sleep at the gate. Some water and sodas were provided but not enough for everyone. The ticket agents seemed to be ""put out"" in trying to help us. Isn't that their job? I believe that customer service is a huge part of any business and if you don't have good customer service you have nothing. No food vouchers were offered unless asked for this I found out by asking a fellow passenger where he had received his vouchers.It should have been announced that everyone would receive these after a long night sleeping at the gate. The lack of communication was shameless and again unprofessional! I believe there needs to be some training with the staff at United Airlines Maui to help in dealing with situations such as cancelled flights and exhausted guests. And regarding the 125.00 voucher we received for the inconvenience of this debacle doesn't come close to compensating for the discomfort and inconvenience of having to sleep on a filthy airport floor! Horrible customer service made the situation even worse.",1united-airlines,28/03/15,Recently flew SFO-IAH-EWR then EWR-ORD-SFO. First class cabin every flight. United's 737-900 series aircraft are nice but the leg room provided hardly warrants first class. Wifi failed on every leg except SFO-IAH. If you navigate off the personal entertainment offering to wifi it is impossible to get back. So if the wifi fails - which it often does on United - you have nothing. Meals were improved over past on a couple of legs the same poor food as on the others. Wines still bad. Boarding ridiculous as Group 1 is now huge with no preference to First Class. I've flown the airline for years because of its dominance at SFO but take other Star Alliance airlines when going overseas. United had delays on both parts of return whereas others I knew on Jet Blue out of JFK (down a runway) got out on time. May be time to give up my 1K and go elsewhere.,4united-airlines,25/03/15,I had my first and hopefully last experience with United Airlines this past week. I flew round trip to Orlando with a friend for spring break. Our flight down was delayed three hours because of weather which is admittedly not United's fault however we missed a connection in D.C. and had to fly standby on a later flight that put us at our destination 6 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane. They then cancelled that flight after leaving us sitting for two hours while they tried to find another aircraft. At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby. I was booked on a confirmed seat to Albany for Saturday morning and tried two standby flights Friday night. My friend made it out but I ended up in the airport overnight (I was not offered accommodation). When I went to board my flight Saturday morning they informed me that there had been an error and the flight was overbooked. I was bounced from that flight and booked on one departing in the afternoon. The afternoon flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems and I was unable to get out until Saturday night at 11 pm. After all that they refused to even consider shipping my bag until I had landed in Albany (it had been shipped to Burlington on Friday). It is now Monday and I still have not received my bags. Their customer service is unfriendly unhelpful and refuses to let you speak to someone in charge. I will never fly United again and I discourage anyone from doing so unless they don't mind spending hours in an airport without their luggage.,1united-airlines,24/03/15,Business seats not up to international standards. The row of 4 seats in the middle feels like a dormitory. Excellent that an airline would invest in such sub-standard seating. United is my last Star Alliance choice for international travel.,5united-airlines,24/03/15,I booked my trip from UK to Florida via Newark over 8 months ago. I did not realise that the flights would be regularly cancelled or changed. First flight out of Manchester was 3 hours delayed because of staff shortage. Last flight out of Fort Lauderdale was delayed by 4 hours leaving us 30 minutes to run to gate for the flight back to Manchester. There is only one flight a day and we felt we had to make it. Most of staff were not interested in helping us. The whole United experience was a nightmare not the dream holiday we planned. Also the inflight entertainment did not work in my seat.,1united-airlines,24/03/15,Arrived at Calgary Airport only to find out our plane which was coming out of Denver was delayed over two hours due to weather. This will put us in Chicago too late to make our connection. This means we cannot fly out till the next morning. United will not give us a voucher for anything because the delay was not 4 or more hrs. I looked at Denver weather radar and there is no bad weather. Gate people keep saying bad weather. Maybe there was down the line but not in Denver as they are insisting. So they don't have to supply vouchers for this late leg. The week prior I was booked on flight out of Houston. They had to change equipment then we were told it would take a few minutes to do the 'paperwork'. Two hrs later they finally finished. I like being informed and being told the truth. Will not fly United anymore.,1united-airlines,24/03/15,I recently flew United from Shanghai to Chicago on B747-400 in Global First seat 2A. This airline is a disaster. First the boarding. Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendantsâ€_- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable. Flying United is not really a first class experience in any shape or form.,4united-airlines,24/03/15,I was very hesitant to fly United again for my family vacation. The first time I flew United I ended up sleeping in the airport when my flight was cancelled. The second time I had two delays that left me on the runway for two hours each. Today I am done. I will never fly United again. Right now I'm in Houston. I was supposed to be in Florida two hours ago. Instead my family of three is sitting in a hotel room with a 4 year old who can't sleep.,1united-airlines,24/03/15,25 Jan 2015 UA993 (LX3218). 1 Feb 2015 UA992 (LX3219). I swore I'd never fly United a couple of years ago this time I didn't notice the flight was operated by United. Horrible experience. Delayed for 2 hours as always. For 9 hours flight they serve very little food cold and bad quality. Rude attendants. No legroom uncomfortable seats  everything is wrong with United. I know learnt to always look very closely which airline the flight is operated by.,1united-airlines,24/03/15,I booked a flight to Bahamas through United and it was their Silver Airlines. My flight over was late and coming back the plane had 20 plus passengers and we were all checked in and they delayed our departure. We all missed our connecting flights. There was no apologies no explanations. We were to depart at 2.25 finally getting off the ground at 6.25. Since I was heading to New England there were no seats and I had to purchase a new ticket on a different airline and could only get to Hartford. That ticket cost me $600 and I am very upset with their lack of customer service. My advice don't fly United Silver unless you have make your flights a day apart. This company didn't apologize and kept us in the dark.,1united-airlines,19/03/15,"GRU-EWR-LAX r.t. in BusinessFirst. Wife and I sat in center row (2-1-2 configuration) so had lots of room. I was dreading being in the first row since when I'd been in a similar configuration before people stepped over my feet all night to get to rest rooms but now the seats are ""suites"" so no problem. Very comfortable fully lie- flat seats. Food was actually pretty good. Service good. Nice array of films. We chose United for this trip due to price but were pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. Only two bags up to 70 lbs. each even in biz (some airlines allow 3) but overall we were happy. All of our flights were calm but if there was any possibility of turbulence I'd want the announcement to fasten seat belts to be audible to all even those asleep not just on video screens (as one reviewer suggested).",8united-airlines,19/03/15,My family and I were flying from Cancun to San Antonio with what was supposed to be a short stop in Houston. Because the plane departed late from Cancun we made it through the long lines and customs with 15 minutes left to make our gate. That is until they called me back and said they won't take my luggage. I asked why and was told there was not enough time. We told them we could easily make it to the gate and they refused to let us go. Instead we were sent to the ticket counter to. Rebook our flight. That is when we were told the flights were booked and we might not leave till the next day. They were not willing to work with us at all and it just infuriated us more. We asked to speak to the manager and he also came off as arrogant and took no responsibility for our situation. We ended up having words with him that got us nowhere. That was the last flight with United that we will take.,1united-airlines,19/03/15,I traveled from Minneapolis to New York and didn't have to check my suitcase at all. Then on my way back to Minneapolis I had to check my bag at LaGuardia airport in NY. I don't understand why I have to check my bag on the way back but not on the way there. The baggage people were not the nicest and it definitely wasn't an ideal situation. I had to pay a fee that I wasn't planning on paying and I shouldn't have had to pay it. From this experience I would not fly United Airlines again.,1united-airlines,19/03/15,"YOW-EWR-PBI on the Sunday of March Break. Both flights on time using Embraer emb-145 and brand-new Boeing 737-900er with scimitar winglets and boeing sky interior. Ground and flight crew really polite and helpful with special mention for the check-in agent at YOW for being a brilliant help. Both flights on time with good seat comfort (I am 5'11"" 160 lbs.) with the real treat being the new plane and the boeing sky interior. My only gripe was the lack of IFE on the almost 3 hour EWR-PBI leg but with a book and music it was no big deal. Would recommend United for a reliable (but not outstanding) trip quality.",7united-airlines,17/03/15,With so many carriers to choose from why would anyone fly United. We flew from San Fran to Boston and were never offered a glass of water. There was no entertainment offered. On the flight out it cost $7.99 for DirectTV and it was not worth it. The 'food' offerings were terrible (Pringles? Trail mix?). There is no leg room and seats barely recline. Is this airline for real?,1united-airlines,17/03/15,We set out from Omaha NE approx. 6am to arrive in Kona HI on Feb. 5th at approx 2.30pm. We had connecting flights in Denver and LAX. We sat on the runway in Omaha for 1.5 hrs with maintenance issues and paperwork past our connecting flight departure time out of Denver. At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona. When we arrived in Oahu they had no record of us saying United did not have us booked to Kona. After waiting for everyone to board they were able to get us on. We arrived in Kona approx. 6.5 hrs after we expected to missing a 1/2 a day of our vacation time any activities we had booked and no luggage! Our luggage arrived about 11pm at night. Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed. We were told our tickets were gone for our originally booked flight. So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United. I wonder what their Preventative Maintenance plan looks like if they have one at all and or if they should reconsider their Union as paperwork should not take that long. Not sure we will ever Fly United again. On the positive side we made it there and back!,2united-airlines,17/03/15,I have never experienced such horrible service as I did this past weekend. I purchased my tickets on Jan 30 2015 for a trip on March 8 2015. Arriving at my destination was a pleasant experience the return was horrible upon receiving my boarding passes I did have a seat assigned in which when I bought my tickets I choose my desired seats. All of this occurred at the Washington Dulles Airport First of all I did not have a seat due to no seating being assigned to me and was told I may not have one due to overbooking. The flight ended up being cancelled due to the crew being late so therefore I was not able to get home because no other flights were being booked for my destination. Spent the night in the airport and when I did reach my destination the next morning my luggage had not yet been shipped. This is terrible service being that this was my first time using United.,1united-airlines,17/03/15,This was my first time flying with United. I took a trip from Kona HI to Salt Lake City UT. After 30 minutes and not taking off we finally discovered the fuel pump was out. Problems happen so that wasn't an issue. But they continued to have us sit on the airplane for 3 hours and got upset when people stood up even though the plane was not moving. After the three hours they confirmed the flight was canceled. They set everyone up with a hotel and a new flight which was excellent. My next two flights were delayed for over 25 min of the original take-off time making people rush if they had a connecting flight. I was not at all satisfied with how the trip went. My one day of travel turned into three days. On the newer planes the seats were comfortable. The staff were always well mannered and helpful. The food and beverages were good and the inflight entertainment wasn't great but there were a few options on the bigger planes. The small planes only had magazines which are not entertaining at all. I would not recommend United to anyone I care about.,1united-airlines,09/03/15,Flight 1570 to Tampa 3/2/15. It is absolutely unacceptable to make everyone board and say final boarding call almost half an hour early and then not have the plane prepared with food and beverages and make us sit on the plane waiting for food. Still sitting here when we should have left an hour ago. Why would you not have what is always needed on the plane? It's not a surprise. Why do we need food and beverage when the flight is 2 hours and everyone wants to leave without it? This is poor service poor planning and poor management. We will not be flying United anymore. I have never had this issue with such a short domestic flight. Unfortunately we had to fly United because we had to travel for a funeral and these were the only flights. Now we just want to get home but now we can't because we need stale pretzels that someone may want to purchase and no one can prepare or tell time. Never fly United the Unfriendly Sky's.,1united-airlines,09/03/15,"Houston to Tokyo in Business Class. Five hours before landing in Tokyo when most people are sleeping the fasten seatbelt sign came on and the following recorded announcement was made very loudly. ""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt."" I can't imagine anyone being able to sleep through the announcement. I was never able to fall asleep again during the flight. Can't United find a better way to alert passengers to the fasten seatbelt sign like a message on the television screen? Many United pilots turn on the fasten seatbelt sign when they need to use the toilet so it does come on a lot. Otherwise the food wine and entertainment were excellent and the seat made a very comfortable bed.",6united-airlines,09/03/15,Economy FLL-IAH-GRU-IAH-SFO - typical USA airline nothing special space between chairs is minimum service is the bare minimum. SFO-ICN paid 500 dollars for an upgrade plus some miles and it was worth it. Sat on the business class on the upper deck (B747) really needed for such a long flight. Service was good. Scores would be much higher just for this part of the trip.,5united-airlines,09/03/15,"We traveled from the United States to a resort in Punta Cana. On the return trip our flight was delayed out of Punta Cana by an hour. This created a very short window of time to catch our connecting flight in Philadelphia. A plane was too close to the baggage area which delayed our bags and caused us to miss our connecting flight. We were then told there were no other flights that evening. (It was 8.30pm). The next available flight was at 9.45 the next morning. We were then informed that since the delay was because of ""airport traffic"" United was not responsible for paying for a hotel room for us-she did provide us with a pink card that would allegedly provide a cheap rate for us. After calling the number on the card that this upstanding United Airlines representative had so generously given us we learned that the nearest hotel we could stay at was 50 miles away. We were fortunate to find a ""Parking Spot"" driver who took us to a nearby hotel where many other stranded United Airlines customers ended up that evening. I hope to never have to give another dime to United Airlines and have told the travel agent to avoid them if at all possible.",1united-airlines,09/03/15,I flew from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to DC with a connection in Houston. There were literally thousands of people waiting to check in to United flights in PVR with lines stretching the length of the entire terminal. Only four check in desks were open one was even closed. There were no announcements and a United rep went through the lines asking for passengers on the next flight only once. Flights out of PVR were delayed by as much as 2 hours or more. There was no help in Houston for people who would miss their connections. I arrived at my gate just before the door closed and the sullen attendant at the desk refused to ask permission for me to board. A few minutes later the door even opened to let out a passenger who had been checked into the wrong flight and the (now two) attendants refused to try to get me on board. This was the last flight out to DC and as a result I had to stay overnight in Houston. All told it took me 26 hours to travel from PVR to DC entirely due to United's incompetence and non-existent communications. A true nightmare.,1united-airlines,09/03/15,We booked a flight from BWI to IAH for 2/22 at 7.10 am and were scheduled to arrive in Houston at 9.45 am. Instead we did not arrive until about 8pm. It was an all day ordeal and we lost an entire day of our vacation. United had mechanical issues on flight 234 but after many delay announcements it took them until about noon to cancel the flight. We sat on the plane for a short while then for many hours in the airport until they cancelled it. Then we had to go all the way back out to check-in to wait in a line for about another 2 hours to be told there were no flights at BWI to Houston that day. United employees were few and far between not nearly enough to handle the re-booking of an entire flight. Eventually we were bussed to the Dulles airport for a 4.30 flight to Houston. We were not given any food and United employees were short-tempered and quite helpless. I heard other passengers say they received food vouchers so I couldn't help but wonder why we were not given anything. Maybe it was because we were Travelocity customers rather than direct customers with United or maybe it was because we were very easy and never mouthy or difficult with anyone. On our flight from Dulles to IAH I was seated in a middle seat separated from my husband which was very difficult because of all the turbulence and my motion sickness. Our experience with United when flying back started out much the same - computers down very long lines and few United employees to help. After check-in the process finally improved and our flight back to BWI was smooth and uneventful.,1united-airlines,04/03/15,R/T Portland to London Heathrow via Chicago. The outbound leg on antique 757 and 767s made me long for the good old days of air travel circa 1995. Far more comfortable than the return leg on brand new 777 and A320s. The older aircraft had wider seats and the flight from Chicago to London was less than half full so I had a full row to myself. The newer aircraft were by comparison more cramped had uncomfortable seats and were completed packed per the norm. The seat back entertainment systems were non-functional. Food was ok. Nothing special but edible. Flights were on time. Overall a satisfactory experience given that the airfare was a bargain.,7united-airlines,04/03/15,"Just got hosed by United's new international luggage policy. Flew from US to Grand Cayman Island last week. No longer do they allow the usual 1 checked bag free which is the standard on international travel. $25 for my wife's bag and $25 not overweight not oversized just a regular bag. Seems now any checked bag now is charged for shorter international flights. Plus to make matters worse for some bizarre reason Grand Cayman will not let you go through security with a fly rod despite having flown all around the world with one and no problem from any other security. So now this has to be checked which becomes a 2nd checked bag at $40. $40 for a couple 30"" long by 1 1.2"" diameter tubes taped together! At least that one was only on the return leg. I travel a lot and while I cant say I will never fly United again since there are limited options anymore but it will flat out have to be my only option to a place I really want to go to. They even require you to pay if you wanted to watch the flight information screen which is just a GPS screen with a plane drawn on it showing where you are on a map! They have always been bad now they are abusive.",1united-airlines,04/03/15,"July 21st 2014 on UAL Flight 111. As a general fact I like United Airlines. I liked Continental a lot so United when acting under the Continental side is wonderful. However I got a bit more ""tulip"" and less ""globe"" on my flight from Miami to Newark. The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming. If I'm flying in and out of Newark a former Continental hub I deserve Continental service. Let Chicagoans keep their United I'll keep my Continental.",6united-airlines,04/03/15,I flew from Sky Harbour to San Francisco for a connecting flight to China. As per other American Airlines United really is a cattle truck delivery. On both flights with United you had to check any items larger than a backpack at the gate often by a grumpy employee. The flight was okay but the cabin attendant look like she was going out shopping for the day United really lacks class on all level.,5united-airlines,04/03/15,FRA to IAD in economy on February 27 2015. This was a very smooth flight all around. Boarding was clear and orderly. Dinner was very good as was the pre-landing snack while the screens were not the biggest the choice of entertainment was huge. The main differences between this flight and the tip-top level of service were the absence of warm towels and the lack of juice service during the in-between hours. Those are trivial. United offers an excellent product and the 777 is well maintained.,9united-airlines,04/03/15,2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would have co-oped with these extra hours had it not been for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots was tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. When we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flight attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United.,1united-airlines,04/03/15,February 27th flight UA 836 from Shanghai to Chicago was delayed 1.5 hours we got on the plane and were told that one of the radios was not working. After 2 hours the captain said that the flight was cancelled. I was sitting on the upper deck. When the flight crew were walking out of the flight deck they saw us all sitting and asked why were we still in our seats and did they not tell us that the flight was cancelled? We told them that no one made the announcement! Half an hour later the gate agent came in and told everyone in Chinese that the flight was cancelled they repeated in English that we should get off take our bags and proceed to door number 24 near Burger King where there would be a bus to take us to the hotel. They did not say which hotel or which bus. Everyone was confused which way to go. After much shouting by the mob of passengers they lead us to passport control. We went through but could not find out how to get out of immigration. Together with another passenger found gate number 24 but there were no people or buses. I found a United staff member who told us that the door had been changed to #23. We went out and there were 4 buses. No one knew what we were saying as they did not speak English. Luckily a Chinese woman came and we found the bus to learn that they were taking us to Sheraton 1 hour away. I decided to go to the Airport hotel which is in the terminal instead and pay out of pocket. They have arranged for the same plane to fly tomorrow at noon. This is an unscheduled flight. United really dropped the ball everyone was stranded with no direction or help.,1united-airlines,24/02/15,"Terrible experience flying UA from SFO to IAD. Very poor customer service all along the continuum. First my return seat assignment was changed from an aisle to middle seat without my knowledge (no one would correct the error by phone) then there was a 5 hour delay leaving SFO. Upon arrival at IAD we found our luggage had been loaded on a different plane that would not arrive at Dulles for another hour. Because of the 5-hour delay it was almost midnight at this point. The next day we had to go in search of our own luggage at the ""lost luggage"" distribution center. United Customer service staff was of no help. Talk about the unfriendly skies.",1united-airlines,24/02/15,Cheap cheap cheap. Golly how expensive would it be to let people watch the TV news on an all-day plane ride or allow 'free' Wi-Fi which is free everywhere else in the western world? A few snacks anything? Had a lovely cheerful flight attendant between San Francisco to Newark but all the airline nickel-and-diming takes all the fun out of what used to be half the fun: getting there-or back. It's as though they hate their passengers and make the trips as miserable as possible seats too narrow for a normal rear end aisles two skeletons could not pass in no place to put your legs if you have two seats that recline an inch and a half charges for even a small bag everything. Back to cars and trains or staying home I think it is just too exhausting and annoying and expensive to fly anymore.,1united-airlines,24/02/15,My wife and I flew business/first class on United Airlines from Maui to Denver with a plane change in LAX. Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours. We sure could have used those lay-flat beds for the over-ocean portion. We've avoided United for several years now and from now on will continue to avoid them.,1united-airlines,24/02/15,Recently flew from Sydney to the US on United and a bunch of internal flights within US and returning home on United. Read a lot of negative reviews about United before I travelled so was a bit sceptical about the whole experience. I'm an average meat and three veg type of guy if I pay a beer price I don't expect to get Champagne service. Who does? I was more than happy with the service provided given the fares I paid. I recall only once one of the internal flights was delayed and it really wasn't a big deal. I would definitely fly with United again. I really think some people need to get a grip they want silver service for bargain basement prices. You get what you pay for and I was more than happy with United. No hesitation to fly with them again.,8united-airlines,24/02/15,Travel from Newark to BOM direct and back Delhi to Newark direct. Paid for extra leg room but didn't feel much different. Food leaving Newark was good. On way back from India it was terrible. The veg breakfast was not edible. On return at Newark they could not unload checked bags for over two hours. Those with connections missed them. No apologies were made or compensation provided. In the future will prefer any other airline to United and are considering canceling our United credit card. Worst airline in business today.,3united-airlines,24/02/15,Flying UA in F (oxymoron alert) from ORD to NRT. Our 13-hour flight was delayed for three hours after we had boarded because of radio issues. About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The â€œsausageâ€ù that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) â€œDon't ask me I don't make it.â€ùThe shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable. When I remarked on this (politely and with a smile) to the FA while putting mine on she patronizingly replied â€œWe can endure anything for a few minutes Mr. Johnson.â€ùWill never ever fly United long-haul again.,1united-airlines,24/02/15,I have flown United my whole life. It had been ten years since I had flown. This last week we flew from the mid west to the pacific coast using nothing but United. It's natural to have delays from weather related issues but We didn't have any to worry about. What has completely destroyed my desire to fly anywhere again is the complete lack of planning customer service and treatment from all the personnel we had contact with. Our delays service and vacation was substandard because we chose this airline. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.,1united-airlines,24/02/15,"Overall based on a round-trip flight between IAD and SFO I would give United 0 stars. On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation. If a medical kit was on-board it wasn't made available to the medical personnel who tried to provide assistance and it took 15 minutes for the Flight attendant to bring a wet towel to help cool the patient down. Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even ""we apologize"" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn't arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn't show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did. Most of the customer support folks at the Baggage Claim customer support were surly and not the kind of people who should be working in customer support.",1united-airlines,18/02/15,"SFO-HND/NRT-SFO in First. The outbound flight was so not First Class. The crew never addressed anyone by name-I think there were 6 of us and when my aisle mate had trouble finding the chest belt the FA motioned and pointed rather than walking to the seat to assist. The dinner was OK but there was no style in its presentation-or of any of the meal. The crew was present when necessary but had no real interaction with any passengers that I observed. The breakfast was insipid. Again poorly presented eggs lukewarm and the potato patty was soggy and blah as was the some-kind-of sausage patty. All in all it was a simply so far off the ""First Class"" moniker that I arrived feeling nothing but annoyance. The return from Narita was much better. United still lacks any sense of presentation or style but the crew was friendly present and engaged. The meals were both better than those on the inbound more tasty and hot but still far off the mark that is achieved by other airlines not only in First but even in Business. I used miles but had I paid the full freight I would have been furious at what was delivered. I will give UA credit for its hard product. The seat is comfortable and has plenty of storage area and the IFE is good.",5united-airlines,18/02/15,From the moment we tried to check in at the Spokane Airport until our return from Costa Rica a week later we felt like we were just a major inconvenience to the entire Airline. At check in the staff member rolled her eyes while informing us we were in the wrong line and it went downhill from there. No smiles no greetings no nothing - flight crew were grumpy and detached. When I asked what was on their food menu for purchase another roll of the eyes and was informed it was in the book in front of me. Leaving the plane you could almost hear the flight crew heave a sigh of relief the flight was over and they were rid of us the entire plane load. We were pried into our seats with a shoe horn and never in all my travels have I felt so claustrophobic - the 3 hour leg of the trip was almost unbearable to sit through. No leg room small seating and the person ahead of me nearly had his head in my lap when reclining. Given a choice this would be an airline choice of last resort.,1united-airlines,18/02/15,I recently flew from Indiana to Kansas City with a connection in Chicago. My flight from IN to Chicago was delayed by two hours causing me to miss my connection and stay another night. The staff at the ticket counter were very rude and not helpful at all. The next day my flight from Chicago to KS was delayed again because of another plane coming late. Two and a half hours later we finally take off. All the staff can say is sorry for the delay. Needless to say I will never fly with United again.,1united-airlines,18/02/15,Chicago to St. Louis round-trip. All flights were on time with friendly service. Midday in Chicago I cleared security in 10 minutes. Mobile boarding pass is very helpful. Boarding was quick and easy. Flight operated by Shuttle America E-170. The plane was very comfortable with lots of legroom in standard economy. I am 6' and had no problem. Return was equally as easy. St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights. I arrived an hour be fore both flights but could have got there much later. I recommend United and usually don't have issues with them and plan to fly them again in the future.,7united-airlines,18/02/15,AUS-IAH-LGA in F. First segment on a new E175 in Economy Plus. Actually really surprised at the comfort of the seat despite all the negative press about the new Slimline product. Of course this flight was only about 30 minutes but for a regional hop not bad at all. Continuing segment was on A319 in F. Seat was moderately comfortable but pitch was lacking and by the end of this 3 hour flight I was definitely eager to deplane. Service was attentive and professional however and drinks were consistently refilled. Food could have been better but what else is new. Overall I was pleased with this journey and despite being loyal to AA would consider UA again if traveling to one of their hub cities.,7united-airlines,18/02/15,"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not. Since United has obviously different point of view in this regard I will avoid flying them next time.",3united-airlines,18/02/15,Houston to Narita and Narita to Houston - dirty plane restrooms not cleaned during the flight and staff could learn how to serve with a smile from almost every Asian airline. Only positive was the flights were on time. We should not be treated like cattle and rude attendants who complained about the merger of two airlines rather than even attempting to serve the passengers. Oh and the meals were 1/2 the quality of ANA Delta Air France or KLM.,2united-airlines,18/02/15,"Up at 3 am for a 6 am flight from Buffalo to Miami with stop in Newark. Buffalo to Newark bathrooms on plane out of order. They were to tell us before we boarded but did not. Arrive Newark 8 minutes late. First ones off aircraft onto shuttle at terminal ""A"" to terminal ""C"". Race through airport no time for bathroom stop arrive gate to be told they sold our seats. They had to know we were on the flight because they had our luggage. Very angry workers directed me to service desk where they booked us on a flight 12 hours later to Miami where we had to pay for another hotel for a night because the car rental company that we booked through was closed. The plane was still at the gate while we were making other arrangements. I am a frequent flyer and will now utilize another airline.",1united-airlines,18/02/15,"SJU-EWR-FRA. First leg in the Economy Plus seat located next to a toilet with a broken door that would not close by itself - very annoying. Inhospitable apathetic crew. No greetings no smiles robotic service. EWR departure 2 hours late. No apologies just stating the fact. Old cramped seats filthy toilets nasty food no complimentary alcoholic beverages unfriendly incompetent under-trained crew with same ""we do not care"" attitude on EWR-FRA leg. Why they call themselves ""flying the friendly skies"" is still a mystery to me! In general if United domestic service is bad its transatlantic one is just appalling. I wonder how they manage to compete with other airlines and still sell their tickets since there are so many choices now. I would never recommend this airline to anyone!",4united-airlines,12/02/15,Recently flew from Boston to San Francisco on a 757. First at the check in where Star Alliance Gold Passengers have to pay for an extra bag. Then to the lounge - dirty and too full. Then onboard - crew so grumpy and super senior rude crew. Very limited service and no smiles at all. Crew just wanted to get their job done so they could chat amongst themselves at the back of the Y class cabin. Honestly I dread flying this airline - UA has to be the worst airline in the Star Alliance. SQ TG NH TK please teach them how to serve their customers better!,1united-airlines,12/02/15,Flew IAH-DEN-IAH on A320 last week and we had the Personal Entertainment Option (Beta). I guess after Beta unfortunately we have to pay for that too. Both flights on time and nothing to complain about.,8united-airlines,12/02/15,"I have been a loyal UA Mileage Plus customer since 1984. On my last flight from FLL to SFO (Flight 1645 on 2/1/2015) I was not admitted into the FLL Lounge - despite me having presented a very valid UA Club Pass which I received last week in relation to my new Chase MP Explorer Visa Card. Even the remark that I travel on First Class did nothing. The lady in the lounge claimed that the United Passes I got from Chase were falsified! They were not as UA customer service later confirmed. The flight itself was a horrible experience: None of very old blue leather seats in First Class reclined. There were no foot-rest (which is standard even in many Economy Classes around the world - for example on Turkish Airlines). The United First Class Seat was at least 30 years old with a sealed armrest ashtray. The food was horrible and cold and a stewardess did not know the difference between white wine and champagne. The Video system on my seat had no audio. The much touted ""Wi-Fiâ€ù did not work - I could not connect. I conveyed to UAL that they should not use such equipment on long-haul flights. The flight in First (which really was not a First Class experience at all) cost me 50.000 Miles. I will frequent other airlines from now on.",1united-airlines,12/02/15,FRA-ORD-LAX-OGG. All flights were in clean planes with enough legroom (I've 183cm of height). IFE on international SEA-IAH-LIM return. This was a good trip outbound in business class. The lie flat seats in the B767s on the Lima leg were excellent crews were attentive. My wife broke her leg in Peru so we had a medically assisted evacuation back and the service was excellent wheelchairs attendants etc. all good.,7united-airlines,06/02/15,FRA-ORD-LAX-OGG. All flights were in clean planes with enough legroom (I've 183cm of height). IFE on international flights depends on the aircraft but on B777 and B767-400 its working well with a good choice of movies. Staff friendly (with one exception) food compared to other airlines (e. g. Lufthansa) much better. We missed our flight in ORD due to a 45min-delay in FRA for which United was not responsible. We could Hotel vouchers in Chicago flew to LAX and OGG the following day and arrived in Maui about 20hrs late. OK we missed one day in Maui but we got compensation (350USD for each passenger).,6united-airlines,06/02/15,"Frequent flyer here. Worst flight experience I have had. Flight was supposed to be 53 minutes long. Got 44 minutes delayed due to late arrival of the plane. After boarding 15 minutes delay due to ""technical difficulties"". Smallest plane I've been in. Even though I wasn't planning on checking in my backpack the plane was so small that most passengers had to give their carry on luggage to the flight attendants to pick up from the luggage claim later. After landing (59 minutes after we were supposed to) the baggage claim carousel wasn't turned on until 35 minutes later! 2 other flights' passengers have landed after us collected their luggage from the carousel next to ours and left. Finally 40 minutes after landing (which is unusual for a domestic flight at a small airport) they started providing our luggage. The only good part about the whole flight was the behaviour of the pilot and the attendant. My ride was waiting outside for an hour and a half and I was extremely embarrassed. Never again.",1united-airlines,06/02/15,Recently travelled from Fort Lauderdale to Vancouver on 2 different United Airline flights. I have never complained to an airline before about leg room until now and have been travelling since 1976. If you tried to seat your pet into an area as small I think you would be answering to a higher authority. That's how bad it is folks! They actually allow passengers to recline their seats during the flights so you know the rest of the story!,1united-airlines,30/01/15,In-flight service is long out the window video entertainment is endless infomercials and the last scraps of legroom have vanished into thin air. On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that donâ€™ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased anâ€œEconomy-Plusâ€ù seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child. For $25 a luggage bag had more space than me - and was treated much better!,2united-airlines,30/01/15,My family and I flew United for the last time over the holidays. We bought tickets the previous March in order to get direct flights to the west coast and seats together. We chose to fly out of Logan - very inconvenient for us but the only airport offering a direct flight. A few weeks before our trip we received an email telling us that our flights had all been changed. Now we were leaving hours earlier getting in hours later with stopovers both ways. These flights were on Christmas day and New Year's Eve - clearly a few hours made a huge difference. Also our seats were no longer together. I will never fly United again. Customer service is terrible.,1united-airlines,28/01/15,Never again will my family and I fly with United Airlines! We flew in from Sacramento to San Fran and we missed the connecting flight to Hawaii because of their delays. We had to wait 2 hours then fly up to Seattle and then to Hawaii which made a 5 hour flight over 6 hours! On the way back from Hawaii we had a flight connecting us from LAX to Sacramento but missed it once more because we were sitting on the Tarmac for 40 minutes doing nothing. There were no more flights to SAC so we had to spend the night in LA. My husband 2 sons and I are now missing work and my 2 other children are missing school. Missing the flight once was bad enough but a second one is totally unacceptable. Both times the planes we needed to get on were sitting there and we were only late by minutes and they wouldn't let us on. We missed a whole day in Hawaii because of it. Also on the flight with UN from Hawaii to LA there was no complimentary food.,1united-airlines,28/01/15,London to Costa Rica via Newark. Check in was quick and efficient. flight to Newark left on time and we landed 20 minutes early. The 777 was clean well equipped and comfortable. In Flight service excellent and food and drinks plentiful and good including the ice cream and caramel that was very impressive. Transit through Newark was somewhat long but that is nothing to do with the airline. Flight Newark to Costa Rica was on time. Aircraft was a 737 of some age but the seat was fine and the crew excellent again. Food and drinks again good for a short haul flight. So my experience of United was a good experience and well worth trying as the tickets are good value and extremely competitive against other carriers.,10united-airlines,28/01/15,MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.,7united-airlines,28/01/15,Flight 914 from CDG to MCI with connection at Washington Dulles on Jan 14 in Economy class. The product featured by United is sub-standard. Of course ageing aircraft in the main leg (767) is clean and well maintained and this is the minimum you can expect from one of the largest airlines in the world. Check-in boarding operations baggage everything ok. Seats are standard. VOD is poor with very limited options and not user friendly. The music program was out of order for this flight and films not plenty. Besides on individual screens maps are not detailed and this system is less advanced than 20 years ago (I am not joking) in Asian companies. Also flight information is given exclusively in feet inches miles just if the metric system does not exist in the rest of the world! Regarding meals they are almost edible. We had chicken with some sauce (more sweet than sour) a large salad with a too smallish cup of dressing (good) and a kind of sponge cake pompously christened crumble â€“ wrapped in a cello paper printed European quality but made in Alabama. All in a very small slippy tray complimented with picnic cutlery (100% plastic). And of course passengers have to pay 7.99 $ for one beer. Ridiculous. By the way a sandwich (not bad) was served before landing but do not expect more than water between meal and snack. Fruit juices ice creams and other open bar is a dream out of reach at United. Attitude of cabin crew very professional (attendants have apparently about 20/25 years experience) working efficiently but not cheerful (friendly skies really?) in very bland uniforms which could be copied from Railways of the 70â€™ Being familiar with Asian and Middle East airlines I find United well below what you may expect from such a large corporation.,4united-airlines,28/01/15,United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.,5united-airlines,26/01/15,"I flew to London on the so called ""Dreamliner"". United is so bad they have now changed out the seats in coach to the same tiny seats for short commuter flights. United plus is not a better seat or service just more leg room which is the least of the issues unless your over 6 feet tall. Beer and Wine are now $7 each! They are free on European airlines with more comfortable seats. I used to be bothered when they cancelled direct flights from Houston to Paris. Now I don't have to chose between United and Air France!",1united-airlines,26/01/15,We had truly horrible service from the first flight out to the last flight of the return trip. United booked us to fly into Newark to connect with a flight out of JFK - we got the joy of finding this out when we checked in. On the return flight from Zurich the cabin crew announced that they were short staffed due to management cut- backs. Translation in our case where we were seated near the rear of the plane is that we got one small sandwich six hours into the flight. I would have killed for a glass of water and maybe some food. Then our connecting flight to Raleigh was cancelled due to 'weather' and therefore we were responsible for our own sleeping arrangements. The 'weather' in Raleigh was drizzle. Our bags went American and arrived on time. A complaint to United was not even met with an apology. Instead they offered of a $100 voucher for future travel with them!,1united-airlines,26/01/15,I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.,1united-airlines,23/01/15,LAX-MEL - B787-8 - Overall a good flight. Equipment changed from a B787-9 to a B787-8. Not too disappointed since it was still a Dreamliner but the change to the smaller aircraft had the consequence that a baby was moved from the forward business class to the 3 Business rows in the mid-section. A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent. Unfortunately United does not supply their Business customers with Fast passes for Melbourne Airport Immigration so waited almost 1 hr to get through on top of the 1.5 hr delay. All in all a great plane and can recommend if you are traveling to Melbourne.,7united-airlines,21/01/15,"I am currently sitting on the flight that was supposed to depart at 6.05 am from NY to Dayton. It is 6.40 am and we have not taken off. We have been sitting on the plane for almost an hour due to ""maintenance issues."" I am not going to make my connection and this is after the exact same issue on the flight I took to NY. I was sceptical to book a flight with United based on anecdotal experience with friends and family but now I am experiencing it first hand on both legs of the trip. The first flight of the day and it is delayed? It is evident how United does business. By the way no word on when we are leaving.",1united-airlines,19/01/15,UA163 GUM-ICN 1/5/2015. We sat in the airplane 1.5 hours before departure due to a missing logbook. Add 5.5 hours to destination makes 7 hours total time in ac. Breakfast was served it was small and below standard. Flight attendants were hard to find for any extra drinks. 2.5 hours prior to destination captain turned on fasten seat belts sign due to turbulence hence terminating inflight service. There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers. Inflight entertainment was poor quality. The small movie screen had continuous static making it impossible to watch.,1united-airlines,19/01/15,MAN to EWR RT BusinessFirst. I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years. Shame but they just don't deserve my business anymore.,1united-airlines,19/01/15,IAH-GIG-B767/400. In the morning on United Airlines on-line check-in I could see that Aircraft would not be a 777 but a 767. At night  on departure mess was absolute. Seats had been re-marked separating couples etc.. Departure was delayed 2 hours due to Cargo issues resulting of Aircraft change (which was NOT unexpected). Late 1h45 mn at arrival in Rio. No Amenities pouch (why?). Unacceptable food for International Business class: Ugly and dry. Overcooked. IFE was the same as 2 months before. How ? Seat remains flat and comfortable. FA's tried their best but passengers were upset.,4united-airlines,19/01/15,Dallas - New York - Stockholm. I have previously promised to never fly United again after a couple of extremely poor flight and customer care experiences. Now I end up on two United flights once again because that seemed to be the only option. This time the experience was slightly better. The staff is still a bit grumpy the entertainment system is below average the food is among the worst I have had in the air and the check-in processes are a bit strange. Nevertheless I ended up coming home on time without being too frustrated!,5united-airlines,19/01/15,Flying now United Airlines round the world starting from Europe. Never again on a UA flight unless it is the last choice. They started me on a feeder flight from Oslo to Frankfurt only to tell me that they pushed me 24 hours on their flight to Chicago because they simply cancelled the flight that day. I did not accept and got across with Air Canada but ended in Toronto rather than USA. Had 5 internal flights in the US scheduled time seems an approximate time not a target for UA. I boarded in Washington on UA803 via Japan with same flight number going to Singapore. After boarding we sat excess 15 hours in the plane awaiting for UA to finish their maintenance. Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage. Tough luck same flight number means 2 different airplanes on the two legs and no margin to be late crossing the Pacific. 6 hours waiting with shifting to Haneda. Business class and Star Alliance Gold card means nothing to UA's level of service. Never UA again.,1united-airlines,19/01/15,I flew from San Francisco to Managua and the overall value and service was typical for United. United has the worst food and in-flight entertainment in the industry. The flight attendants want to serve you food immediately after the flight begins so they can chatter in the forward and rear galleys of the airplane. Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers. United Airlines overall is of the worst carriers for inflight services in the airline industry. I was in Business/First and they wanted me to pay for both the internet and DirectTV why don't you just consider me a customer that hates your airlines and that will avoid you at all costs.,2united-airlines,19/01/15,"Newark to Fort Lauderdale on 13th January 2015. Flight on time and aircraft clean. Decent seats with good legroom in premium economy. What lets them down in the complete disinterest and discourtesy of their staff from check in and throughout the journey. No smiles no interaction no welcome on boarding just generally no customer interaction at all. I am a silver member and frequent flier with BA and their staff are far far superior in terms of customer interaction at all points in the journey. Overall not a bad airline at all they just don't live up to their logo ""Fly the friendly skies"".",5united-airlines,19/01/15,SFO-SEA-SFO. A320 + B737/900. Late on departure in both cases. On time at arrival in both cases. No frills. Check- in smooth and as an alliance gold no baggage cost.,6united-airlines,19/01/15,Every flight I was booked on today was late or canceled. I am sure the airlines would say not our fault but it was late planes. Mechanical failures that blocked gates. First officers that don't show up and scratches on the bottoms of wings that mysteriously grow while the FO can't be located. Two guys booked on the flight decided to drive to Indy because it would be faster than flying. Not a ringing endorsement.,2united-airlines,19/01/15,TLV-ORD via EWR business first. Comfortable seat and was able to sleep for 7 hours. Dinner OK good entree nice service. Seats flat and convenient. Breakfast OK. Catering could be better but reasonable. Staff constantly in cabin during dinner and breakfast. Liked catering on Austrian and Turkish better. EWR United club nice showers and service from club staff but mediocre offering of snacks.,8united-airlines,19/01/15,EDI-EWR UA37 on B757-200 aircraft on the last day of 2014. (Part of a â€˜Pâ€™fare booking EDI/EWR/PBI and return). Checked-in at the dedicated business class desk and was advised that UAL use the â€˜Aspireâ€™ lounge at EDI. The lounge was fine with a reasonable selection of food items for a snack breakfast. Flights are not called from the lounge. Boarding appeared to be well managed a number of supplementary security / travel questions were asked by an agent at the gate. Once onboard a welcome drink of champagne juice or water was offered. There is a 2-2 flatbed seat configuration in Business Class. The seat was comfortable with plenty of space and easy-to-use chair and In Flight Entertainment controls. The plane Departed on time at 09.05. On board service began roughly 45 minutes after departure. The main meal was lunch followed by a snack prior to arrival at EWR. In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation. Overall the flight was a pleasant and efficient experience. I would use UAL again in Business Class subject to obtaining a fare at a suitable price!,7united-airlines,19/01/15,SFO-IAH B767-300. Seat broken not inclining. No advise at check-in that would allow a change before upgrade list to be activated. Lounge as a nice view but nothing to eat and bar is paid. Went to Singapore Airlines one. Much better.,3united-airlines,19/01/15,This was my first and last time flying with United. I am a frequent Delta and Southwest traveler and was beyond disappointed with my experience on United. Our second flight was cancelled and it took someone over 15 minutes to inform us of this cancellation-additionally I was not notified via their app about this cancellation. It was 10am and they claimed they had no way to get us home that day unless we spent $80 to take a shuttle to another airport and then took two more flights from there. They then charged us three times for our bags. Overall (not including the two extra bag charges) this cost us an additional $180 and they refused to pay for a cent. I will never fly this airline again. Also as a side note as we spent the entire day in the airport we noticed that they overbooked every single flight some flights were overbooked by more than 10 people! Terrible airline-poor customer service and extra fees for everything (snacks bags television etc.),1united-airlines,19/01/15,On our way back from Cancun we had a stopover in Houston. The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures. I travel back and forth from the United States just to Canada alone at least 7x (round trip) a year. We recommend you stay away from this airline.,1united-airlines,14/01/15,"Flew from LAX-LHR in Global First on the 777-200. Pros - Overall it is a very comfortable seat nice and soft bedding with a mattress pad small cabin (only 8 seats) great inflight entertainment system and friendly service. Cons - Food was subpar for international first and the appetizer was a spring roll and a coconut rubbed shrimp skewer - very similar to what you might find in a cheap cocktail party. Soup was served in a teacup sized bowl main was ok desert was ok too if you like ice cream as that is the only option. If United wants to compete with other international first class it needs more refinement style and ""class"" in their product. As I used award miles for this seat it was perfectly fine. I would only fly first on an upgrade or on an award ticket otherwise it is not worth the money.",9united-airlines,14/01/15,I was astonished that 3 out of 4 flights of my honeymoon were delayed. In fact 2 of the delayed flights were more than 2 hours delayed. We flew 28th May 2014 LHR-SFO which was on time where we were supposed to catch a flight to HNL. The HNL flight was over an hour late in departure. On our return trip on 18th June 2014 the HNL-IAD flight was more than 2 hours late and the connecting flight to LHR on 19th June was boarded then disembarked as the plane was faulty - and we ended up with a 3 hour delay. No one at the airline seemed particularly bothered or apologetic.,4united-airlines,14/01/15,Flew from San Diego to Mobile. On all 4 flights they didn't have my husband and I sitting together. We talked to customer service at both airports and they refused to make any changes unless we paid $59 to upgrade to an extra leg room seat. To add insult to injury you have to pay for your luggage pay for the direct TV pay for any snacks - not even a peanut for free.,1united-airlines,14/01/15,"FRA-EWR-PHX-EWR-ZRH. FRA-EWR on old 767-300 with a tiny little screen in front of you that shows some movies on channels. Own earphones did not work. Plane very loud. However seat quite comfortable very nice cabin crew and good and tasty food. Legroom officially at 31in. but feels bigger than on transatlantic BA or AF. Brought my own entertainment so I had an excellent flight (should have brought earplugs though). EWR-PHX on newly refurbished A319 with slimline seats. Again lots of legroom even for me (6'6"" / 2m) and again no IFE but wifi available. But again a nice crew with two full drink runs (alcohol for purchase) and some walk throughs with water. PHX-EWR on 737-700 also with new interior and AVOD. However this is provided by DirecTV cost is $5.99 for flight of two hours or less and $7.99 for flight of more than 2 hours. Sadly even the flight information part is enclosed here so you don't see it unless you pay for it. Again two drink runs and good service by nice flight crew. Of the four planes on this trip this one had the worst legroom but still OK. EWR-ZRH on 767-400. Old plane with brand new interior - and a good one at that. Slimline seats with a big screen in front of you a large choice of new movies games and shows. Legroom again very good the 31in. at United appear to be bigger inches than those on other airlines. Tasty dinner and small breakfast (with fresh fruit!). After reading many bad reviews I had mixed feelings about stepping into a United plane. I even considered doling out the (quite big amount of) $$ for Premium Economy. But I got corrected. All planes were clean and well maintained nothing rattled or fell of. The crews were all nice and helpful. Legroom was never an issue even with pax in front of me reclining. After this experience I highly recommend United. Before you fly - find out if you have to bring your own entertainment (or pay for it)!",9united-airlines,14/01/15,I have had more then one bad experience with United Airlines. Used United to fly at least 10 times in the last 10 months and almost 8 of those times something has gone wrong - cancelled flights ridiculous charges for flight changes if necessary recently my boyfriend couldn't make his first flight so United was going to cancel his round trip ticket home which meant he had to buy new flights. These are just a few examples.,5united-airlines,14/01/15,"DAY-HAM round trip in Dec 2014/Jan 2015. All I can say is ""the absolute bare minimum"" from United. When you buy a ticket these days the airline only agrees to get you from point A to point B. They do not agree to feed you entertain you create a realistic schedule get you or your luggage to your destination within any realistic time frame or to help you find said luggage once they lose it. This is what you may expect from United - nothing more.",1united-airlines,14/01/15,Stuck in Belize for 7 hours because the plane did not leave Houston. No further explanation on the matter except that the plane never left. The United staff that rescheduled our connecting flights was extremely rude and not helpful at all. It almost seemed as if she was taking joy in the fact that we were all stranded there. Then every passenger was forced to stay the night in Houston. My flight was supposed to be the first flight out of Houston leaving at 7am so I get to the airport at 5.30 am to find out that now it doesn't leave until 9:00. Every single staff me member I've encountered or asked for help from is miserable and rude. This was a one time thing but I will never ever fly United again. It's been the worst airline experience of my entire life and I've flown hundreds of times.,1united-airlines,14/01/15,My husband and I traveled using ANA from Winnipeg - Bangkok then Toronto - Chicago and the Chicago-Toyko Narita flights were on United. We upgrade to Premium Economy for the 13 hour flight for comfort. Immediately we were grounded for 2.5 hours because the plane wouldn't accept the fuel. So all passengers including us who had to transfer in Narita were going to be late. Once finally in the air all audio wouldn't work. To add insult - the stove and cooking equipment wouldn't work either! For this 13 hour flight the attendants served us frozen turkey sandwiches with ice cream. United staff did announce to everyone that they were sorry for the poor service. They did pay for our hotel we were checked in at 3am and had to been on the next flight at 8am. The good news was the flight from Singapore to Bangkok was on Singapore Airlines. They are always in the top 5 airlines in the world for a good reason. On this 2.5 hour flight we had much better service. United needs to completely overhaul their policies from top to bottom.,1united-airlines,14/01/15,LAS-SFO B737-900 and SFO-SYD B777-200. First leg was a short flight on a new plane soft drinks served courteous crew seats were just average but still too short flight to complaint. Second leg killer flight to Australia almost 15 hrs upgraded to Economy plus which was disappointing because basically is the same as economy with just a wider seat pitch that gave me more leg room and a comfortable sleep. Food just fine the trays are getting smaller and smaller crew was nice and attentive plane a bit old IFE average small screens with a good selection. I have no problems flying UA again but it has to be a really good deal as it is oceans apart compared to Qantas or Air New Zealand on the same routes down under.,7united-airlines,14/01/15,The flight attendants on the flight from MEL to LAX couldn't have been more attentive efficient and professional. Same on the LAX to NY and LAX to MEL. Food was reasonable drinks were served regularly cups of water offered often and service was second to none. I had heard all manner of criticism about United beforehand however decided that given the effort by United to revamp the airline putting the 'Dreamliner' into service non-stop between MEL and LA it was only fair to give United a fair chance. United Airlines staff were nothing short of fantastic having arranged assistance for me on arrival at the various locations - in general over and above their call of duty.,10united-airlines,11/01/15,What a ridiculous flight. My husband and I had to first had to wait over an hour to check our bags from Colorado to Alaska. Then our flight was over an hour late because of delays loading luggage. We missed our connecting flight and we had to wait in Anchorage with our three month old son for 8 hours. We didn't get a meal voucher or anything. The staff that worked for United told us that we weren't entitled and it was too bad. They gave everyone free movie on the plane but my husbands didn't work. I had already paid for a movie so it didn't matter on my screen. Will not be flying United again.,1united-airlines,11/01/15,United looks appealing simply because it offers more choice and times. In previous years it has been my first choice. Each time I was hoping the problem was just a fluke. The last 3 United flights all had huge delays and poor handling of the situation. The delay was not reported until after boarding time and passengers were not assisted with missing their connecting flight. Staff were rude and the planes were not very clean. United has grown too big to properly handle itself. If your looking for quality not quantity United is not the airlines to pick any more.,1united-airlines,11/01/15,NRT-SFO upper deck B747. Check-in was quick and easy going. Avoiding UA depressing lounge went to ANA one which was not so so better. Wines not good. Food really uneatable (chicken). Desert: high calories ice cream with artificial flavor dressing. All of this to be avoided by healthy persons. Nice IFE but much more limited than on B777. Old seat  but much more comfortable than B777 ANA's.,7united-airlines,11/01/15,SFO-SAN. B737-800. Everything fine quick and easy but luggage did nor make it. It arrived two flights later. Mysteries of UA/SFO.,7united-airlines,11/01/15,Flew from LHR to Orlando via Washington. At LHR the staff were very helpful in sorting out our ESTA cock-up (kids' passports had been changed since applying for ESTA). That is the only positive about United. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped the choice of in-flight entertainment poor (even if you could see it on the minuscule seat-back screen) or for the 2 hour flights pay-TV and the food absolutely disgusting. No snacks offered (I guess they are worried people will fill up on these having tasted the food) although available to purchase and no complimentary alcohol. Attendants fairly average and could certainly do with a better corporate uniform on trip out. On way back distinctly poor. Most worrying was the man who was on our plane and about 20 mins before take- off realized he was on the wrong flight only when somebody else came to sit in his seat. How is that allowed to happen on United from Washington? From a security point of view it is unbelievable and I wonder how the poor bloke fared trying to find the correct flight. Oh yes and over-booked flights which I thought were a 20th century thing.,2united-airlines,11/01/15,I flew UA from New York to LA and had to buy $10 headphones if I wanted to watch the TV. I also booked the flights with my partner and put us seated together and when we printed out our boarding tickets they had moved us so we sat separately on the flight. We then flew from LAX to Sydney Australia. Once again they had separated us. We were extremely annoyed that we had to spend a 14 and a half hour flight sitting in between strangers when we booked to sit together. There was no complimentary alcoholic beverages and the good food always ran out by the time it got towards the end of the plane which a lot of people complained about to the staff. Overall I would never recommend UA to anyone. Splitting up couples and putting single riders between them is a joke and not good enough.,2united-airlines,11/01/15,Travelling from Ottawa to Maui on December the 28/2014 my experience with staff was not pleasant some of them were very rude and impolite. Service was pitiful not picking up garbage. At one point I had to take my own trash to the back of the plane where staff were standing and chatting between themselves. If I can help it I will never travel with this company again.,3united-airlines,11/01/15,I used United in the past for domestic flights in the US and it was average I thought it would be fine to use them to travel abroad. Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price. Other airlines give full service for about the same price!,1united-airlines,11/01/15,Flew round trip Houston to Honolulu in Business Class costing over $6000.00. The seats didn't recline enough to sleep comfortably. The foot rest was manual and difficult to operate. The seat was not as wide as a normal business class seat. There was no TV monitor only wifi via the United app and your personal screen device. No one on the flight was aware of needing a personal device on the flight. There were no outlets available to charge a personal device if you had one and the wifi kept going out. The selection of movies was not current. Older movies and TV shows were the only thing available. The meals were awful pasta and sauce and a burrito the return flight had the same offerings other than a pathetic breakfast sandwich with paper thin ham. No amenity kit was offered on the red eye return flight. There was nothing upgraded or business class about this flight. I do not recommend this airline for the trip to Honolulu from Houston.,1united-airlines,11/01/15,"Flight 1252 to LA. Flight started off delayed 20 minutes then out to 40 minutes. Then we boarded and sat for a further 20 minutes. No communication from the staff regarding the delay until the standard 'loading some late luggage"" excuse. Really poor. Flight finally pushed back over an hour late with very little comment from a cabin crew that were largely anonymous. Crew standards are pretty ordinary. Never again with UA.",1united-airlines,05/01/15,"Hong Kong to Newark in Business Class. Good flight attendant and a very comfortable bed. Unfortunately the Fasten Seatbelt Sign came on at least 8 times during the 14 hour flight and many times for the smallest turbulence which most passengers ignored. However a very loud recorded message came on every time that said ""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign please make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened"". Because of this announcement I could never sleep more than 90 minutes at a time.",5united-airlines,05/01/15,Flew SFO LAX and ICN - SFO in Business as part of a RTW ticket. I continue to see improvement at United. On the short hop to LAX I was in F and the drinks were served in glass as opposed to my last experience when they were in plastic. The FA was friendly and very present. On the transpacific leg I was on the Upper Deck. I continue to really like the UA Business Class seat. It has more positions and the space is well designed. The dinner was quite good - Cioppino - and nicely served. Most US crews lack the energy and enthusiasm that one finds on foreign carriers but the service was friendly and attentive. I have no complaints.,10united-airlines,05/01/15,Paid over $6000 for business class ticket to Honolulu. This is an 8.5 hour flight. Seat was smaller than any other business class seat I've experienced - no recline and very uncomfortable. Meals were worse than usual airline food a sad dish of penne pasta and tomato sauce. Second meal was a burrito wrap! Entertainment was pathetic. No monitor only WiFi which did not offer any new releases and service was sketchy lost connection several times. Staff was average competent but certainly not $6000+ of friendly skies. Will avoid flying this airline if at all possible. So not looking forward to the return trip. Would change plans but united charges $200.00 for any changes.,2united-airlines,05/01/15,"We flew from SYD to LAX in United Airlines Business Class B777 service in December 2014. We were quite pleased with the overall experience. The seats proved to be comfortable in the sitting position. They were a bit too narrow though for comfortable sleeping even for a 5'2"" woman. In comparison my wife stated that her recent Business class long-haul flights on Qantas and Emirates had much better seats for sleeping primarily due to the greater width. She found it very difficult to get to sleep on the United seat although she noted that the United seats were more comfortable in the seated position. The length was felt to be adequate. Storage space was minimal but adequate for our needs. TV screens were very generously sized and of good quality. Food service was excellent in quality as well as the attentiveness of service and friendliness of the staff throughout the flight - deemed to be slightly better than both Qantas and Emirates in that respect. Overall a good experience so perhaps United is making effort (apparently successfully) to improve its quality of service in recent months.",8united-airlines,05/01/15,I flew BFS-EWR on November 3rd and returned December 3rd 2014. United is one of the worst airlines that I've ever travelled with. IFE was broken on both flights the cabin crew were indifferent and some were down right nasty the food was horrible. I will never fly United again.,1united-airlines,05/01/15,Flew to Cancun in early December from NYC. To return to NYC we arrived at the airport in Cancun more than 2 hours before flight to find the United service desks in complete chaos. The line to check in stretched the entire length of the airport. No one was sure if they were on the right line as the signage was very confusing. No other airline had such problems. Very stressful and unpleasant. Will not fly United to Cancun again.,2united-airlines,05/01/15,I recently returned from a round-trip from Charlotte-Rochester NY with change of planes in Dulles on the outbound and Newark on the inbound. The trip was fine. Flight attendants on all flights were very professional. Ticketing crew in Charlotte and Rochester were nice. I used the lounge in Newark and was pleasantly surprised. Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties). Still the lounge was a pleasant alternative of the hub-bub of Newark. I am a fan of propeller planes and was not disappointed. Both flights in and out of Rochester were on props. I will fly United again.,9united-airlines,05/01/15,The first leg of our flight was substantially delayed so when we landed in Houston there was no time to eat. Had we known that the next leg was also going to be delayed we would have just delayed boarding and grabbed something. From Houston to Aruba the flight attendants were unfriendly and cranky. They began to offer food for purchase only to find that there was only enough food for the first 1/3 of the plane. On this long flight they only came through the cabin once for beverages. A week later found us at the United counter because one member of our group of three had mysteriously been dropped from the reservation. It took over an hour to get United to see the error. Then of course the flight from Aruba to Houston was delayed but at least we didn't have to wait on the plane this time. Flight attendants were at least cordial and offered beverage service twice. They offered food as well but we had learned our lesson and ate in Aruba! Late getting into Houston so had to run (again) to catch our next plane for our final destination. The gold has definitely worn off the United name it's just sad that they have taken Continental (which I used to love to fly) down with them.,2united-airlines,05/01/15,Right now sitting at LAX on the taxi way for 40 minutes waiting for gate to open - ridiculous. This is after 5+ hour flight from Lihue HI. This is very poor management.,1united-airlines,31/12/14,"I have been thinking of switching my loyalty from US Airways where I am a Million Miler. I am a mere silver on United but decided to add some miles on a round-trip from JFK to LAX with a return through IAH to get a rare domestic ride on a flat BX seat in the internationally-configured 787. Completed the outbound yesterday in a 1 year old 737-900 with 20 ""first class"" seats. When the FA's started taking meal orders. The FA first goes to a young lady in the seat in front of me and informs her of the two menu choices. He then moves back to my row (4) and asks the woman next to me which she wants. He then looks at me and says he will be back. Then he works the other side of the aisle. He appears to be randomly moving between seats. Finally he gets to me and there is only one choice and he explained they have been instructed to service the FC cabin in order of United priority. In other word the 16 nonrevenue upgrades get their choice compared to the schmuck without a lot of status who used real money (and not a small amount).",4united-airlines,31/12/14,United has stopped providing complimentary alcohol on international flights. Flight between Asia and US they put us on a plane with no individual TV screen but the sharing overhead projector TV with pre-scheduled movies during a 12-hour flight. On my recent trip I traveled extensively with Cathay Pacific and Singapore which offers first class customer service to all travelers. I originally chose United based on its extensive hubs domestically and internationally expecting better travel planning and experience. With the increasing routes from CX between US London and Asia and the abundant options of good airlines domestically (Southwest JetBlue Virgin) I'd much rather put a little effort to plan my trip than to travel miserably with United.,2united-airlines,31/12/14,"I was returning into Houston and catching a United flight from Houston to New Orleans. As usual for United they cancelled the last flight into New Orleans for ""maintenance reasons."" Told they could have fixed the problem but would have had to call in a new flight crew and they don't want to spend the money - it's cheaper to book passengers into a hotel. This has now happened to me and close family members no less than five times in the last couple of months. It has become a routine practice with United.",1united-airlines,31/12/14,Flew Business class earlier this month Dulles-LAX round-trip. Seats were better than coach but not by much. They recline only a little. Staff on the red-eye back to Dulles served a snack immediately what is the point of that? I just wanted to sleep at midnight! Then they were noisily talking and carrying on throughout the flight with the galley lights on the whole time. No curtain to block light no attempt by them to keep their voices down so people could sleep. On the trip from Dulles to LAX my inflight entertainment system didn't work.,1united-airlines,31/12/14,"This was my first transatlantic flight and it was miserable. Being 6'4"" the legroom was not nearly sufficient. Food wasn't worth the calories and lacked all flavor. Staff is indifferent and we left ORD 90 minutes behind schedule. I know it's become clichÃ© to hate on United but it Really is subpar. I've since flown Aer Lingus American Turkish British and KLM over the same route and all were better (American was a tie I'd say).",3united-airlines,31/12/14,"Every winter United Airlines serves up the same ""we do not care"" service and ""Do not even ask us to care"" as it's simply more than they wish to even dream of fixing. Every winter flights leave Denver for the 30 minute hop into Aspen. Every year some flights may not land safely and the captain turns the plane around and takes the entire group back to Denver despite having three other airports at lower elevations that would place everyone within an hour to 90 minutes by bus or rent a car to Aspen but they make zero effort to make any contingency plan for this regular occurrence year after year. On the flight return to Denver the air hostess nor pilot make any effort to make any arrangements and at the counter upon arrival of course we wait another 30 min for a gate and the pilot answers are weaker than the air hostess. Then they try to pile all of us like cattle at the one service counter where the zig zag line crawls us through to one sour puss to tell you it's an act of God which excuses every lack of genius displayed on a regular basis. Each and every winter. Useless company #1 Award. I only gave them one star because I had to. Grooming is something else too with hair hanging out all over the place.",1united-airlines,22/12/14,"It's shocking how bad this airline can be. Flying out of Chicago-the United hub-we were delayed 2 hours while maintenance searched for a ""no go"" part to secure the carts in the galley. How such an apparently essential part was unavailable anywhere on the O'Hare property is unbelievable. It was a completely preventable delay and yet we received no apology from the crew.",1united-airlines,22/12/14,Late into Denver switched to Late flight to Chicago but they dropped our names off the seating chart so we all had spread out horrible seats given a motel in Chicago turned out to be a scam (had to pay for motel) because no more final destination flights until next day. Some very nice service but mostly very unfriendly rude horrible service people work for United. On way back same thing. Two hour delay for final destination and had to get another room waiting for guess. Which led us to meet another rude service person in customer service dept. So I will never fly the Un-friendly sky's of United again.,1united-airlines,22/12/14,I flew United First Class San Francisco to Seattle (Dec 2013) returning Jan 2014. I was appalled at the service or lack of! No food or drink service at all and this was in First Class! Ground crew at Seattle were terribly rude and should not even be employed in the service industry. United is the worst airline I have had the misfortune to travel on!,1united-airlines,22/12/14,"Sat in 24D on an Airbus 320 from Seattle to Newark. This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.",8united-airlines,22/12/14,My wife and I travelled first class from Orlando to Newark recently. We were surprised to see there were no PTVs on the plane. When it was time for meal service we were told there was chicken dinner or a salad. We both don't eat chicken so we ordered salads - we were told they were out of salads. Policy for the 12 first class seats - 6 salads and 6 chicken dishes. Out of luck! We had cookies for dinner.,1united-airlines,22/12/14,Orlando to Denver to Edmonton - because we had problems printing our boarding passes we went to airport and a courteous member of staff printed off our boarding passes for us. Because of that today we simply walked to security and went through. We only had 1 carry on bag each and one pack sack each. The staff announced that we could take our carry on bag and they put tags on each of them for us and we dropped them off at the circle just as you boarded the plane. Our bags went straight through to Edmonton. Due to technical problems we left about 1/2 hour late but that was ok. Before we got off the staff read off the gate of connecting flights. That saved everyone a whole lot of time. We made it to our next plane - had about 10 minutes and that plane had to wait for our baggage. There were other passengers in our position also The staff were excellent. No food except to buy not staff's fault. No TV's again not staff's fault. The seats were very comfortable.,9united-airlines,18/12/14,LHR-SFO-ACV. Flight leaving LHR cancelled ground staff at Heathrow rude and obstructive wouldn't confirm flight was cancelled even though I called United direct who confirmed flight cancelled. United app also stated flight cancelled after 90 minute wait in departure lounge. Transfer to Newark flight which was then delayed leaving Heathrow as SFO passengers transferred onto this flight. Overnight accommodation provided in Newark. Return flight from SFO-LHR all London based crew utterly rude and disinterested in the role that they are paid for. 7th flight this year with United only airline that gets me to my final destination. Crew rude when I walked to the back galley to purchase duty free told me it was the busiest hour of the flight as were serving breakfast before landing at Heathrow I only went direct to the galley as message on screen advised 15 minutes remaining to buy duty free. Crew member told me she hated that message and that she would have to come and have a private word with me for purchasing duty free. Flight already booked for Feb 2015 luckily booked with flight miles so know not to expect a great service.,1united-airlines,18/12/14,"Fly the Friendly Skies of United? There's very little that's friendly about United they have become an airline of lesser quality than the budget airlines of the world. Connecting business class flight from Auckland to San Francisco via LA. The first leg was non-stop on Air New Zealand which was excellent and connected in LA to a business class flight to SFO. When we presented our ticket at the United lounge in LA we were refused entry because it was a business class ""domestic"" flight but were offered entry as a guest of another person we had met on our flight from NZ. Sadly the lounge was a worn out mess nothing more than crackers and cheese slices in packets Internet access that was just a bit faster than the old dial up connections - nothing like any of the lounges offered by carriers we had flown elsewhere in the world. On the tired worn plane a minimal offer of chips or cookies and beverages. The worst part is that the personnel seemed tired of being caught between management decisions that have reduced the quality of service to nothing more than a poor commodity and travelers that resent the carrier.",2united-airlines,18/12/14,"Flew IAH-HNL-IAH in First Class on November 20- 24. I have flown this route several times in the last 15 years and since United took over the flying experience has taken a serious nose dive. Since this route is taken by people mostly cashing in frequent flyer miles and there are not that many ""paying"" passengers United has decided that we do not deserve the amenities that are available on other routes. The first class cabin seats are very uncomfortable and are nowhere near the first class seats of other carriers for long haul flights. The plane had no inflight entertainment and there was not any power ports for charging personal devices - and this was not just first class but the entire plane. If there was another direct flight to Hawaii from Houston on another carrier I would take it. Flying to Hawaii on Continental was a fairly good experience the food was good and the seats were comfortable even though they did not fully recline.",1united-airlines,18/12/14,Booked flight from Newark to St Maarten months in advance - booked an aisle seat and a ctr seat together United changed our seats to a window in next to last row and a window in the last row with seats that don't recline. Also paid for TV and only had the choice of 4 movies-no TV shows - no free snacks. We will do our best to avoid United airlines in the future!,1united-airlines,10/12/14,Was happy with the service in First Class on this quick flight from LA to Houston on United's 737-900. Seat was comfy and the food satisfactory. Nothing outstanding but good enough.,8united-airlines,10/12/14,I flew with United Airlines to save money but it turned out to be a mistake. I was traveling to Guatemala City from Dallas making a connection in Houston. We boarded the plane then shortly after got off due to a maintenance issue. Not once were we asked if we had a connection flight or explained to how they would help us get to our destination nor did they give us any updates. I had to ask what to do. I was supposed to be at my destination at noon. I arrived at 10.30pm. Similar incident on my return - took me all day. Bad experience.,1united-airlines,10/12/14,PVG-LAX and IAH-LHR. Both flights were very comfortable. Seat and food is good. The only issue with the dreamliner (787) is the lack of proper window blinds. On the flight Shanghai-Los Angeles I was near the window facing south meaning that I always had the sun in front of me. Although the window transparency can be chanced it cannot be completely darkened and this is an issue when you want to sleep.,8united-airlines,10/12/14,Flew United from LAX to IAH non-stop on an aged Boeing 737-700. The flight departed 25 minutes late for no apparent reason (no explanation given). Luggage was still being loaded 25 minutes after scheduled departure. Plenty of people that should have gate-checked luggage were wandering the plane looking for overhead bin space with no help from crew. There was no snack pay only food options. Nonetheless the crew was somewhat friendly passing frequently even offering warmed up chocolate chip cookies to some of the kids although some had to share one cookie.,6united-airlines,10/12/14,For this 9 hour flight from Houston to Buenos Aires United uses a very old 767-300 with a 2-1-2 configuration in business class. The seats are the old Continental flat-bed seats which are angled ever-so-slightly towards the window. Although it's a flat bed the bed is very narrow and at my 190cm I could not stretch out. Felt like sleeping in a coffin! Also when you have to go to the bathroom it's quite the operation to step over your neighbour without waking them up. The service and food were OK although the plastic champagne flutes and the character-less dull white dinnerware could be improved upon.,6united-airlines,04/12/14,GIG-IAH-NRT. I succeeded in sending my luggage directly to NRT. No need to pick it up at IAH and then check it again. Flight 1: GIG check-in staff very nice. Lounge (GOL low cost) very poor and packed. Flat seat 9D very nice. This part of Business class is much more noisy because close to engines. To be avoided at all costs. FA's very pleasant and smiling. Decent food. Poor drinks. Smooth 9 hours flight with constant info form flight deck. Surprising wide choice of IFE On time. Had to go through immigration and security in IAH. Lounge staff very pleasant. Food awful. Alcoholic beverages charged (>US1000 a glass). Fantastic shower and shower staff. Flight 2: Seat 1L. The best seat on board much more space 3 windows Silent. Same aircraft by coincidence. FA rather unpleasant and rude. Take it or leave it. Very bad food. Horrible Champagne. A nice white Bourgogne that ended after 30 min. At 11.50am lunch was completed then believe it or not no food during the next 12 hours! A tray with 2 types of frozen sandwiches was available in a corner self service. United is saving money on a 14 hour flight on food? One hour before landing greasy breakfast. Luggage quickly delivered.,3united-airlines,04/12/14,I may be done with United. Have had gold or platinum status for years but am getting increasingly concerned with linking flying to shopping and spending more money. As much as I hate to give up the three bags the comfortable lounges in airports it is becoming too stressful to keep up. I have almost lost respect for the airlines. Shop till you drop seems to be the key here. We are losing miles we have to spend more shop more buy the credit card. No other alliance does what United does.,6united-airlines,04/12/14,First off let me preface that I am not a frequent flyer so I tend to give airlines the benefit of the doubt if there is ever any problems. In the past 6 months I have flown two round trips with United one was non-stop and the other had 1 connecting flight. Every single one of those flights were delayed by an average of 2 hours. I would understand if there were weather conditions that cannot be foreseen but all the delays happened in Florida and California both of which had great weather. I even signed up for text alerts to get notified of these things and my alerts either came in an hour before the scheduled departure flights or never came I'm at all. That defeats the purpose of the alerts because you should to be at the airport about 2 hours prior to your flight. When I went to ask the staff at the counter at the airport they all seemed clueless and was not able to help me alleviate my concerns at all. Some were even downright rude and short with me. These inconveniences have almost cost me to be stranded at the airport because those my friends and family were not able to pick me up. I am more than furious at the less than poor customer service that United has to offer. I've spent hundreds probably even thousand of dollars to travel with this airline but I've failed to receive the proper service and professionalism from their staff and company overall. It is sad to say but I will not be flying with United Airlines anytime again soon. I would rather pay a bit more for other airlines just to ensure that I will receive the kind of service that I should be receiving as a customer.,6united-airlines,01/12/14,United 1064 on November 25 from Newark to Boston. I think United must go out of their way to design a seat as pathetic as is in row 32 on their 737-700. These are narrow don't recline and have no legroom. I travel a lot on business. Luckily I generally have a choice in airlines and I wont be choosing United again.,1united-airlines,01/12/14,Flew Business class between Australia and California (Sydney to San Francisco and LA to Melbourne). It was my first time flying Business class as I normally fly Economy or Premium Economy and as such I was looking forward to it. Overall I was very disappointed: food was average toilets were dirty and did not appear to have been cleaned difficult to get the staff's attention staff not willing to smile even when I was smiling at them meal service was disjointed (on one flight they offered a bread roll and some wine after I had finished my main course on the other flight they took my glass away for a refill and didn't bring it back) and the staff kept on bumping me when they walked past. The only good thing was the beds lie flat but otherwise I was very disappointed and I found that the Premium Economy on other airlines is much better (such as Qantas Virgin or Singapore). I will not waste my money on United Airlines again.,3united-airlines,01/12/14,I took a United flight from GRU (Sao Paulo) - IAD (Washington DC) in Business First. When I first came to the airport I saw the flight would be delayed for 5-10 minutes. The flight time was originally 12.05 am but because of the delay it was supposed to depart at 12.15 am. So it was ok. But then after I board the flight does not leave until 12.40 am because they were waiting for passengers to board so obviously some passengers were late. In Air the flight crew was nice but they seemed like old United flight attendants to me. So they seemed a little cold to me. But the flight was good and I slept for 4 hours out of the 8 hours. I was glad the flight attendants gave my son the executive dining with out him asking. But the flight entertainment was ok. So it was an ok flight and it was better than the average United flight.,7united-airlines,01/12/14,I did my first transatlantic travel with UA premium economy on 11/15/2014 IAH-MUC 767-400ER. Plane was clean entertainment systems fully functioning great service onboard. Food was a bit underwhelming but it's economy so not much can be added there. Beverage carts made fairly frequent trips. Crew did a good job.,8united-airlines,01/12/14,"Don't pay extra for business on United. We just flew United from Vancouver to Oahu via San Francisco and are now on our way back. We paid the extra for business class - the ""breakfast"" on our first flight consisted of a scone. On a 6 am flight you don't exactly have a chance to grab a bite before departure. There was WiFi on this flight and it had personal TVs which are better than nothing but not quite up to what we are used to with Air Canada. We barely made our connection in SFO - our bags were not so lucky. The next flight had personal TVs but no Wifi. The latter would have been really useful on the long flight. At least we finally got breakfast. The flight crew was inattentive on both flights. On the way home the long haul flight back to the mainland did not have personal TVs or overhead screens but it had WiFi! That was great for as long as my laptop battery lasted but alas the old seats had no power outlets or USBs so my joy was short-lived. Both of our seats were not capable of staying in the upright position and would slowly recline. We chose United over Air Canada as we didn't want an overnight flight home. Next time we will go direct with WestJet and cram into their tiny seats in exchange for a direct flight that operates at a convenient time. We wish Air Canada would put back their daytime flight home. In summary - service and amenities on United are inconsistent even in United First. Even when they are at the top of their game it's all pretty marginal.",2united-airlines,01/12/14,Horrible customer service at SFO. United flight was delayed into SFO from Vancouver so I missed my connecting flight to San Diego. We got into SFO at 11.50. I am still waiting in line with similar stranded passengers at the customer service area at gate 82 where there are two attendants helping 100 plus people. The attendants at the gates will not help us even though there is no line. This is deplorable. SFO is a United hub. There are United employees and gate attendants everywhere and yet there are only two people willing to help all these stranded passengers. I have been stranded many times with many other airlines and have never had such poor service. I will never fly United again.,1united-airlines,20/11/14,I travelled with United for the first time last week. I was travelling business class and was a little apprehensive. The staff were fantastic very friendly and welcoming. The food was also very good - on both legs (from Melbourne to LAX). The flat beds extremely comfortable with very soft pillows. Not as many frills and extras as other airlines business class but if you can afford this for a long haul flight - the legroom and ability to stretch and sleep is worth it.,10united-airlines,20/11/14,Last week flew ORD-IAH-TYR/SHV-IAH-FLL-IAH-ORD in a mix of 737-900 (updated interior - great) EMB-135 and A319. All mainline jets were in Econ Plus or Emergency Row so leg-room was great. Most flights on-time and service was good. It's so hit and miss with UA as one flight had great service and the next mainline flight was bitter flight attendants. Regional flights were good - flight attendants had personality and very friendly service. Entertainment on some flights and others nothing but a shared screen with a movie released a year ago. Other than the IAH-ORD flight all on-time. Fare was decent so overall a good trip. With UA's new requirements for miles flown and price paid I won't get Gold Status next year and that will reduce my flying with them more than this year.,7united-airlines,20/11/14,BOS-LAX Boeing 757: Had booked Premium Economy for two people 6 months ahead arrived at check-in in BOS to be told by unhelpful and off-hand staff that 'booking not assured until you check-in' allocated economy for the 6 hour flight and money refunded. Excuse of 'change of equipment' from A319 to 757 not tenable as latter has even more Premium Economy seats. On arriving at gate discover that Premium Economy seats are available but now have to pay an extra $36! Customer service in United completely unrepentant of being asked to pay extra for the distress. Actual seats fine but would not recommend using United for Premium Economy on the basis of this experience.,1united-airlines,20/11/14,HKG-SFO. I've always loved the 747 for its speed and comfort. Nevertheless a 12 hour flight is always a daunting experience but I am happy to say that this flight was wonderful. The multinational staff exceeded themselves and the food was of a standard I was not expecting. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed the flight I even got 6 hours sleep too. Good job United and thank you for the pleasurable experience!,9united-airlines,20/11/14,IAD-LAX. Paid full fare First Class only to be shocked upon check in at IAD airport that my selected seat was not confirmed. Though UA ground staff at check in counter were quite helpful they couldn't do anything except asking me to go to boarding gate and wait the problem to be resolved there. I was told UA does overbooking in all classes. I was looking forward to this flight enroute in First Class as I was connecting to BKK hence I wanted to relax. Alas I wasn't able to relax as I had to ask UA team for every 10 minutes for an update. Finally after a long argument with the gate staff I was given a a First Class seat by an arrogant lady who made one feel that she did me a great favor although it was within my right. Nothing special on this full B737-800 flight. Seat was ok with in-seat video but can't recline much. Having been at Jetblue Mint previously ones can't help but compare the value vs benefits.,3united-airlines,20/11/14,Just flew DEN-LAX-MEL and return SYD-LAX-DEN. I was apprehensive about spending 16+ hours with United internationally as I avoid US carriers for long flights due to overall poor service I was however pleasantly surprised. All flights left on time with early arrivals. Outbound flight was on new 787-9 aircraft was great and seats in Business very comfortable. Entertainment with wide variety and crew were splendid on this run (old CO crew)- very chatty and went above and beyond for passengers. Return flight the same though crew a little older/colder (UA crew). 777 on return was 2-4-2 in Business which is a little ridiculous but seats were all fully flat. Where United is not up to par is inflight catering- food almost inedible on both routes- wines good though.,8united-airlines,20/11/14,EWR-MEX-EWR. Flights operated with early arrival in both directions. Super friendly on-board staff and top-notch gate people who are all an asset to the United team at both the EWR and MEX stations. The in-seat TV ads come on to annoy you even if you've turned the TV off. I felt like they should be paying me for constantly having to turn it off.,8united-airlines,20/11/14,Stockholm to San Francisco USA October 8th. The first plane with Lufthansa from Stockholm to Frankfurt on October 8 was OK. The plane from Frankfurt UA 927 to San Francisco did not start at all and we were all transported to a hotel. The next day October 9 after much waiting I was rebooked to Chicago UA 906 with further connection there. This plane did not start either. Waited on the plane for six hours before it finally left so I missed my connection. A few hours rest and back to the airport in the early morning on October 10. I got the flight to San Francisco nearly two days later than was scheduled.,1united-airlines,17/11/14,UA 28 / UA 940 - London LHR / Newark Liberty EWR return. Outbound flight with refitted B777. Enough entertainment friendly helpful staff simple food nice overall. Inbound flight very old B767 but clean cabin and cheerful helpful staff. I was quite surprised by this quality actually as I frequently hear bad rumours about flying experience with United. Well done.,7united-airlines,17/11/14,LHR/EWR/LHR. B757 out and B767 return. Outward flight was just OK. Inflight entertainment was good and the seat fairly comfortable. The big let down was the crew. They were efficient but showed no personality at all and I did not see a single smile from them. The return flight was disappointing. The entertainment system offered very little choice was shown on tiny screens and from what I could see quite a few screens including mine were broken or were only showing half a picture. Again the crew were robotic with no personality at all and although efficient they seemed totally disinterested. Unlike other airlines on the route who offer a free bar only soft drinks are free on United. All in all United seem to be offering a budget almost 'No Frills' service but at the same price as other transatlantic carriers who offer a far better experience.,3united-airlines,12/11/14,I have flew twice from Denver to Winnipeg in the last month and both times they say that food is offered for you to purchase and both times they had absolutely nothing to offer. I boarded these flights thinking that at least I can buy something onboard as I did not have time to purchase something in the airport! I was not impressed to say the least.,3united-airlines,12/11/14,LAX-NRT-SIN. First leg was good on the 787. Food was mediocre and made me appreciate Delta and question myself why i wasn't flying DL that was leaving an hour later out of LAX and Staff basically disappeared between services. The seat was comfortable at least the IFE was not as good as DL due to the smaller choice of movies. NRT-SIN was on a 772. The crew also disappeared after the meal service (which was also mediocre). My sister and I had our seats moved without being told but we weren't complaining.,6united-airlines,12/11/14,I have been flying United for the past 6 years from MAN to EWR and to my dismay it is a total and utter shambles. Within those 6 years I have flown as a solo passenger whilst being pregnant and then with an infant and later with a toddler. I would not recommend them to a single traveler let alone a pregnant one. The only reason we continued to use this airline was due to the fact that EWR has the most quickest and convenient route home. Apart from that there is nothing that is appealing about the airline. The seats are not the slightest bit comfortable however you are able to slightly move them back to a tilt. I can disregard the seating as almost all airlines are the same but the cabin crew were obnoxious rude and definitely did not seem to enjoy their job. Asking for juice was definitely a chore for them. Next time I will not be flying United too many years of bad experiences.,1united-airlines,12/11/14,LHR to LAX return during October 2014. Check-in unavailable on-line and at auto machine at LHR. Had to join queue despite having carry-on bags only. Outbound flight during daylight. Seat fine. Meal average to poor. Headphones fairly useless making it difficult to watch movies etc. Staff good. Return flight overnight complete contrast. Staff polite but charmless. No drinks unless you pay. ie wine $8.99 glass. Food poor. Both flights on time and at Â£60 less than BA basic but fairly acceptable.,8united-airlines,12/11/14,"Flew from BOM-EWR. Fairly full flight. Unfortunately I was seated next to an already drunk passenger. Crew (very observant) discreetely intervened and rectified my problem in 2 minutes flat. I was seated aisle side with an empty middle seat (rare treat indeed). My go to drink on United is the premium red wine (Meiomi Pinot Noir) a solid value (70% premium over store price compared to the 500% premium on beers and booze - only the stupid pays $8 for Johnny Red). Unfortunately they were not carrying it on the flight. The super helpful nice lady comped me with 2 bottles of house red with my dinner andthen brought me a big wine glass (yes a glass and not the flimsy plastic cup) wfull of amazing cab - from the front! andshe brought it one more time before ""bedtime"". I was floored by the attentive service of the united flight crew. Hope my relationship with United will continue to thrive.",8united-airlines,11/11/14,London to Orlando via Washington. Terminal 2 fab help at self serve kiosks swift bag drop and security. Boarding efficient. 777-200 comfortable in aisle seat. Inflight service excellent plenty of soft drink runs expected charge for alcohol so had card with me. 3 choices for dinner lovely green Thai chicken curry with salad and some type of apple cake. FA's disengaged and going through the motions but professional no extra touches here. However clean cabin and toilets blanket pillow and headphones on all seats on boarding. Inflight entertainment choices very good. Arrived on time connection in Washington smooth. Crew on 2nd flight less interested but so was I by this point! Was just so relieved to be on this aircraft ad not some of the older smaller jets UA are still using on transatlantic routes.,7united-airlines,06/11/14,My flight was 2 hours late from MSP to EWR and so I was going to miss my connecting Etihad flight to Mumbai. However the ground staff at MSP were very helpful and booked me on a direct United EWR to BOM flight that was scheduled just an hour later than my original flight. However my good experience stopped there. The premium economy seats were terrible. Not enough leg space and the head support wings were not adjustable vertically which meant anyone shorter than 5 feet 8 inches could not use them. Second there was no complementary alcohol (not even a glass of red wine) available on the 14 hour flight. I was mentally prepared for their standards but was still let down. On top of which I could pay only by credit card for a drink. Considering I was a Indian tourist the likelihood of me doing this was very low. The food was terrible and both the veg/non veg meals were almost inedible. The air hostesses were not friendly and avoided eye contact. They seemed very put upon by their job. I don't blame them as they probably had to eat the same food as us. I would never ever book this airline voluntarily.,2united-airlines,06/11/14,Flew EWR-HNL-EWR on Oct 24 2014 and returning on Oct 31 2014. The crew on EWR-HNL was quite good. They sure let passengers know that the food available for purchase would be available during entire duration of the flight and all we had to do was come back to the galley. Very important on a long flight with no meal service. They also made sure to go through the aisles with water repeatedly. The crew on the return flight from HNL- EWR left much to be desired.,7united-airlines,03/11/14,IAH to DXB via IAD IAD to DXB 5 hours late no help from ground staff I thought that their rules about lengthy delays evidently not on United sat in first class lounge for 7 hours. I have never seen such a pathetic excuse for a lounge the snacks were questionable and the whole lounge is out dated and appears dirty. Cabin staff were clearly annoyed by the delay imagine I paid for this my seat area was sticky and dirty flight attendant was un co-operative when I asked her to clean it. I was never once addressed by my name the crew clearly thought that they were doing me a favour by even being on the flight. Food was worse than I've ever seen even for a United flight. Fortunately I took my own food we were told Restroom was reserved for crew so the 2 restrooms for business class had to serve first class. All food was prepared by bare hands and galley person eat food as she prepared it also sneezed and even scratched her head whilst preparing food. Other airlines offer pre packed nuts etc. considering the choice of other airlines that fly from the US to UAE United is way behind. Looking at Emirates lounge in Dubai or BA lounge in London puts United at the back of the line. I did arrive in Dubai and so did my luggage but the trip was far from first class and worse still some of the original crew were on my return flight and still equally annoyed by having to perform their duties. Cabin staff are obviously disgruntled and it shows I wonder what happened to the old continental crews because before the merger continental really wasn't that bad as airlines go. Today's first class on United is not even as good as the old business first on continental. Worse still one of our group who had suffered 15 hours from Dubai to IAD was down graded from IAD to IAH because of over booking. I've learnt my lesson never again with United.,1united-airlines,03/11/14,"Having spent the last 7 weeks travelling around the world business class with various airlines we were very excited about our business first class flights firstly Honolulu to San Francisco and then Newark to Edinburgh on our journey home. The disappointment started with entry to the lounge on both occasions where no substantial food was offered. Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent Â£6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service). Liquid refreshments are limited with my husband being charged for a third drink when I had not even had one! It would appear that United Airlines Cabin Crew Bar Staff and Club reception staff attend regular classes in being curt disinterested or just plain rude! Thankfully waiting staff etc do not and are very pleasant. Regarding the plane itself on both occasions these were very obviously old and incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting in row 2 on both flights subjected we were subjected to cabin crew slamming doors continuously chatting very loudly or witness several members chomping on food whilst preparing the passengers meagre offerings. Please United Airlines take note of all these negative reviews you are offering a low budget service at a Premium price. Having looked around at the miserable faces (staff as well as passengers I might add!) in Newark lounge as I write this it says it all! We will we making as many friends and family aware of this and I'm guessing the others mentioned will too so I guess ""what goes around comes around"" eventually.",1united-airlines,03/11/14,Traveled ORD-PEK-ORD in economy. Very minimal service. Lounge offerings for star alliance gold are downgraded. Not even packaged cookies any more. Complimentary bar is extremely low quality no complimentary alcohol on plane. In- flight movies are OK. Avoid.,3united-airlines,03/11/14,Just got back home from an around the world trip. 62 hours of total of flying time. Jetstar was not good but I was really disappointed in United Airlines. Our United leg was a 6 hour flight from Newark NJ to LAX. I felt the seats were to close together. They give you water coffee or tea once. That is it. I'm so glad I had some snacks with me. You could buy something if you wanted. For a 6 hour flight they should give you something more. No nuts are anything extra. Really Oh if you wanted to watch a movie you had to pay for that too I will never fly with them again. This flight was booked by a travel agent. I have learned my lesson.,4united-airlines,03/11/14,Having recently travelled to and from London to Nashville via Newark on United Airlines I do not understand how this airline is still in business. We had 4 flights with them one cancelled one delayed 3 hours and one with the most rude and arrogant staff. The airline is a disgrace.,1united-airlines,03/11/14,ORD to PSP via Denver one way in economy. Both flights on time in fact the flight to PSP was about 20 minutes early. Planes clean. Staff was very competent. They are really starting to put in noticeably smaller seats.,8united-airlines,03/11/14,First Class round trip from San Francisco to St Louis. The flight over was fine. The return trip was on a Sky West jet! The 4 hour flight had no video the seats were poor and there was no meal only a snack box! While I'm sure that this saved United Airlines money I describe it as a bait and switch. I paid the extra for First Class and didn't get what I had paid for.,2united-airlines,03/11/14,Flew UA from DEN to HNL in First Class. This is apparently a converted Continental plane with full reclining seats in first class. The seat was very comfortable with plenty of room. The food was decent although the spinach calzone was drowned in a cream sauce - tasty but not very healthy. The servers were friendly and helpful although after the meal was served about an hour in you had to make a request for a beverage over the next 5 hours as opposed to any regular beverage service. I rarely fly first class so maybe they expect you to ask for something as opposed to bringing beverages out regularly? The plane had seatback on-demand entertainment which was great except why is it that the UA webpage is still showing their listings for September and October only?,7united-airlines,03/11/14,"Recently travelled from Australia to US and back this included both international (SYD-LAX) and domestic (LAX-BOS) returning LAX-MEL was apprehensive as had read critical reviews however my experience was positive in all aspects. Found cabin staff both helpful and friendly helping passengers with difficulties in placing on board luggage this was more a problem on the domestic legs probably because people try to avoid checking in luggage and therefore push the limits with carry ons I note that some Aussie domestic airlines are cracking down on this so perhaps other airlines will follow. Anyhow just wanted to relay my positive experience with United and would recommend them for a good service at good price. Loved the ""Dreamliner"" on the return flight!",8united-airlines,31/10/14,Our travel agent booked our flights within the USA from Australia. Each leg was on United Airlines. I had read previous bad reviews on this airline but thought we would give them a go. The experience was okay. The staff were fine each flight was crowded and each time we were down the rear of the plane. There was nothing remarkable about any of the flights but at least we arrived safely.,6united-airlines,31/10/14,"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward. In summary in the future I will make a sincere effort to travel with an airline other than United.",1united-airlines,31/10/14,Since the late 80's I have been flying UA for business and pleasure and it has been a roller coaster ride. Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management. Once again we are riding the competition who are not perfect but much better than UA.,1united-airlines,28/10/14,October 10 LIS-EWR. After arrival at our departure gate I thought I was at a wrong one after looking at the aircraft parked at the gate. To my astonishment I was about to make an 8-hour transcontinental flight on an ancient Boeing 737-200 whose regular use in domestic routes was phased out in 2008. United wouldn't be United without some kind of delay so there was a 30-minute hold. The flight was relatively smooth. Staff appeared to be seasoned but lacking courteousness with one having a condescending attitude and curt tone. Meals were hardly edible - I would say they were the worst of many kinds I have had. Overall I rate my experience with United below average and will try to avoid my future journeys with this airline.,2united-airlines,28/10/14,Went ORD-DCA-ORD overall flights were okay although both were delayed. On my outbound flight there was also a delay because of a seat being broken on the aircraft and subsequently it seemed the flight was either overbooked or not completely ready to depart by the scheduled time due to some confusion with seating arrangements.,6united-airlines,28/10/14,Sat waiting for maintenance and cleaning crews for over an hour. Sat in hot plane for all that time. More ground crew accountability is badly needed. This was just the tail end of our trip. Flights from home were delayed. We have people counting on our arrival for childcare. Unbelievable disorganization of different crews in Houston New Orleans and Illinois.,1united-airlines,28/10/14,"We were traveling Business class from Newark to Las Vegas on Sept 26th. Apparently the definition of Business class offered by United differs from any other airline out there. When traveling economy I normally bring my own bottle of water and buy some food in the airport. This time given that I had paid 3 times as much for a Business class ticket and also remembering what it means worldwide I did not bring anything of my own. What a mistake! When I asked for a glass of water while plane was still boarding an extremely rude flight attendant asked me: ""Do you really want it now?"". Again United definition of a Business class does not include providing enough food for everyone. I have never encounter such unprofessional behavior in any service industry - and air travel belongs to a service industry last time I checked. In Business class provided by United you are paying for some extra leg room and nothing more. I will never fly this airline again.",1united-airlines,28/10/14,"SFO-HKG-SGN-HKG-SFO in Economy Plus. The B744 to and from Hong Kong was clean and well-maintained but showing its age-especially in the lack of IFE. However in both directions the crews were very good with lots of passenger interaction and presence in the cabin. They were HK based and very international in composition. The crews to/from SGN were even better-old Continental Mic staff based in Guam. I had exit row seats on all legs and found the legroom to be fine and the seat OK--but on such long segments no seat in economy is really ""comfortable"". The food was OK-could have been better with just a few additional touches-but no real complaints. The lounge in HK is fantastic-head and shoulders above anything in the US which made for a nice interlude. Overall an acceptable performance.",8united-airlines,28/10/14,IAD-SAV-IAD 29 Sept to Savannah and 13 Oct return to Washington Dulles. We have used United Express on their small Embraer and CRJ200 Aircraft many times before when flying to Savannah from Newark Chicago Washington etc. Always been perfectly OK and usually on time and surprisingly comfortable. No IFE supplied and no refreshments purchased but then again they are only short flights. But this time having booked our flights we were offered Economy Plus seats when we came to choose our seats for $28 each per flight. We duly chose this option and paid only for the aircraft on the outward flight to be changed. The replacement aircraft had no Economy Plus seats - no refund came until I chased this through there refund system. Worse still the return flight was on the original aircraft which never had Economy Plus seats in the first place. I will fly United Express again as they still do the job we want them to do but - if you can't provide the product you are selling then don't take people's money under false pretences.,7united-airlines,28/10/14,United Airlines should be ashamed of itself! Terrible airline and awful customer service! I understand why the airline is the way it is with all the outsourcing being reported on the news. The regional aircraft operating as United Express are old. Those planes are at least 30+ years old! I'm sick of this airline. Always delays cancellations never a flight crew as well as various air traffic issues You spend thousands of dollars with them and they treat there Premier customers as trash. From now on I am a proud JetBlue customer or even Delta!,1united-airlines,28/10/14,UA flight 34 KIX-SFO 15 Oct14. No more peanuts etc no alcoholic drink with meal (I don't care for it) lavatory in back of seats 25A-C has self-closing lids which would not stay up (the automatic flusher worked). I asked for decaf coffee twice never saw a drop. I tried the attendant call button: it rang and the blue light went on: no one showed up the light went out some time later. The food was close to inedible the breakfast sandwich(?) concoction quite a mess. Why oh why doesn't ANA fly this route non-stop? The tone of the authoritative-voice announcements (recorded) was annoying. The flight was good pilot talk fine landing almost smooth. One-star marks below are overly generous.,3united-airlines,28/10/14,I recently finished a mixed carrier trip (United Air New Zealand Virgin Australia). While AZ and VA were wonderful friendly flight attendants decent food (even the stuff for purchase was good) modern planes flights all on time the United flights in contrast felt like traveling in Russia in he 80s. The FAs were angry at everybody and it seems passengers just disturb their peace and are just a huge inconvenience in general. The planes are filthy and old. All my United flights were delayed between 30-60 min and the complete lack of communication in the gate was disturbing. Gate agents were equally grumpy.,1united-airlines,28/10/14,5.55am flight from Buffalo to DC then to Tampa Sunday 10/12. Ticket agent was in training and I knew we were off to a bad start. After boarding plane they deplaned us because they had neglected to complete the security paperwork. Entire plane missed connecting flights with only two rude ticket agents in DC. Earliest flight to Tampa (I was supposed to arrive in Tampa 10:30 am) didn't leave DC until 5.45pm. They routed me to Chicago to get to Tampa arriving 4:30 pm. Ticket agent neglected to inform me of shuttle from Terminal A to D so I ran the whole way. Got on the plane for Chicago which after an hour was cancelled due to technical problem. Entire plane got off and went to Customer Service with only 3 agents where it took 1.15 hours to finally be booked on the 5.45pm flight to Tampa. With all day to spend at the airport they gave me a lousy $7 meal voucher (didn't even pay for one well-needed alcoholic beverage). When I finally got to Tampa at 8pm my luggage did not which I expected since none of the re-routing agents paid any attention to me when I expressed concern about my luggage. Never flying United again.,1united-airlines,28/10/14,2014 Platinum flyer and 1M United Flyer. Flew last night on UA Flight 1430 between Orange County CA and Chicago O'hare. Seated in center of 8th row. 1 row off bulkhead. About an hour before the landing the flight attendants came through with another beverage service. After they had passed I asked my row mates to let me out to use the rest room. The isle to the rear of the plane was blocked by the cart. I proceeded forward to the forward rest room where I was stopped by the male flight attendant serving first class. He indicated that I needed to return to coach and to the rear of the plane to use those restrooms. I indicated to him that the aisle was filled with the cart and the forward restroom was the only one I could get to. He again indicated to me to return to the rear of the plane. I told him I would not and proceeded by him and used the rest room. Behind me was my row mate (first met him on the plane) who is a 2014 1K member. The flight attendant told him he could not use the rest room also he proceeded by him too. All the while other customers are watching this flight attendant act like the Potty Police interrogating passengers about their restroom needs. Unprofessional and ridiculous. Happens all the time.,1united-airlines,28/10/14,"I was horribly dissatisfied with my experience using United Airlines. I was traveling to the states for Thanksgiving weekend and was delayed 3 hours on my first flight due to ""late inbound aircraft"" and again for my connecting flight another 2 hours due to the same reason. Looking back the last 4 times I have traveled with United this has been the reason. There was no weather leaving Montreal or Chicago. Then again on my return flight I was delayed 2.5 hours and 4 hours on my connecting flight. When I finally got to my final destination at 2 am after 12 hours of traveling which should have taken a total of 6 I waited 45 minutes for my checked luggage. When I asked why we were waiting for so long the United representative told me there were two flights coming in from Chicago and they wanted to put the luggage out all at the same time. I've never heard of this happening and several other passengers and I thought this was unreasonable. Our flight landed several hours late why should we have to wait even longer for another flight to land deplane and unload their baggage. I will avoid flying with United again simply because they did nothing but say ""sorry"" and essentially ruined what would have been a very enjoyable weekend with my family.",1united-airlines,20/10/14,Not a good experience flying first class from Seattle to Charlotte. On second leg there wasn't any first class on the plane and they didn't put my wife and myself together. Very frustrating. I did demand a refund and they did accommodate. Flying back from Charlotte they couldn't get my wife and Myself together in first class. Very frustrating. They didn't even try to fix that one. Customer service from United is questionable. They act like they just don't care.,2united-airlines,20/10/14,01/10/2014. LHR-IAH. Flight UA5. IAH-GIG UA129. A journey I upgraded from economy to business first using a global premier upgrade a free perk obtained as a IK level frequent flyer. I feel that the level of service on United has improved drastically and the efforts of front line personnel should be recognised. The flight attendants on UA5 from Heathrow to Houston were superb. They provided very professional prompt and friendly service. A comfortable seat in a new Boeing 787. In fact throughout all including my return journey from Rio via Houston and Chicago all check in and flight personnel were considerate and attentive. All flights arrived on schedule or early. I would also add that as a United flyer since 1995 my baggage has never been lost! From what I can see the only service problems this company ever had are being corrected. If these improvements continue I suggest that United could indeed become a world class leader.,8united-airlines,20/10/14,"We recently flew from Cairns to Guam to Kwajalein on United Airlines. Although mainland US airlines have a bad name for treatment of their passengers - the Micronesia service transcends this. There were a number of aspects about this flight which were worrying. At Cairns the demeanour of the check-in staff was very ""in your face"" - when we asked to speak to the supervisor - this only made things worse. Documentation is a ""very touchy"" aspect of booking in for any US airline these days. Even though we had our ESTA validation application in hard copy to show they basically refused to believe we had a valid ESTA as they were having trouble accessing the data on their computer. This was even though we had our ESTA forms identical to our passports! Take a hard copy of the website baggage guidelines - they make it up as they go! When we finally got in the air - the food is poor. Be prepared for some serious security scanning in Kwajalein as it is a closed airport unless you have a sponsor or travelling to Ebeye - Passport photocopied ESTA examined separate Sponsor documentation retinal scanning height weight finger printing and questioning. If another airline elects to service this route I would certainly look to avoid UA.",1united-airlines,13/10/14,Just completed a series of three flights back to back. The flight attendants and all other aspects of the flight were passable but with that said that's as far as it seems to go. United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad. The flight attendants on most of my flights were much younger than the usual veteran crew that I encounter on their flights therefore enthusiastic. At the end of the day United may not be my first choice but it gets me there.,5united-airlines,13/10/14,Fantastic business class flight from Chicago to Shanghai in upper deck of United Airlines 747-400. Attentive and friendly crew and great food - exceeding business class food on many international airlines. Entertainment system also has excellent offerings. United Business First Seat is very comfortable and creates the perfect lie-flat environment for plenty of restful sleep. I haven't flown United's business class in a few years and was pleasantly surprised.,10united-airlines,13/10/14,Oct 7 SF to Kona First Class. At the prices they charge even in this age of low expectations I was shocked at the experience of this trip. To begin with the aircraft used a 737 is just inappropriate for a five hour trip. The legroom was ridiculous for any class of service but unbelievable for a premium ticket. When the gentleman in front of me reclined his seat I had absolutely no space left. In coach one has come to expect this but not at these prices. I was one of two people judging from the upgrade list posted who paid full fare and that resulted in a full cabin. The flight attendants tried hard but United gave them nothing to work with. The breakfast served was small and awful there was only non fat milk for coffee and the food was inedible. The flight was timed to leave at 9.44 to avoid serving a more expensive lunch by one minute. The cost cutting is unbelievable the experience absolutely horrific to be avoided at any cost. Back to Hawaiian Airlines I go - the extra stop required is well worth it.,1united-airlines,13/10/14,GVA-IAD. United needs to update its fleet flying to Europe. It is incredible the type of screens they have (a bit bigger than a smartphone). How will they ever compete with other airlines? Sadly nothing special.,2united-airlines,13/10/14,Flew Oct 6th LAS-ORD on an ancient B-757. Like a trip back in history albeit not a good one! No idea why United still flies these ancient planes with pretty much original interior from the 80's. Chose Premium economy as it was 35h flight 79$ for this was just a scam pretty much. Got 5 extra inches leg room and that's it. Would have been nice with at least a free sandwich or whatever. Guess US carriers are still years behind European and Asian one's. Why not just call it what it is extra leg room seats? Spent 3h playing on the phone as United appears to address their customers as idiots as this was a morning flight with mostly business passengers yet still playing a cartoon movie on the overhead monitors. Talk about missing your target. Several items on the menu also ran out was sitting on row 2 so guess they just dont care to stock up on items guess what United that's another way to miss income from your passengers. Am a Star Alliance Gold member and will never choose United again as my first choice alternative in the states.,2united-airlines,13/10/14,I travelled with United alone with a 16 month old and 4 yr old twins from Australia to Los Angeles to Memphis Orlando and back to Australia. We got the cheapest fare available with anyone and my expectations were low. United were great! Good and helpful staff good entertainment for twins when we missed a flight we were promptly rebooked and paid no fees food was not excellent but fine. This was a very welcome surprise - well done United!,9united-airlines,13/10/14,I flew from Manchester Airport and was flying to Newark then had a connection flight to Rochester. As soon as I checked in I was told they had overbooked and asked us to fly to London first. I explained that we had a connection flight to Rochester and we were attending my nephews wedding so couldn't have any delays. We were then told there was no seats on the Rochester flight. After a lot of arguing they got us on the 1st flight to Newark and then found us flights on the Rochester flight but the 4 of us would not be seated together. I had 2 children with us and was not happy but just pleased to get the flights. Coming home we were delayed 3 times from Rochester. Our connection flight from Newark was boarding at 6.30pm we got off our flight from Rochester at 7.05pm and had to run for 10 minutes to catch the flight my daughter has asthma and struggled however we just made the flight. I wouldn't book with United again as they did not make either of my journeys relaxed and enjoyable.,1united-airlines,13/10/14,Travelled LHR to SFO - flight fairly full food good and seat plus fine. SFO to EWR - ordinary seat ok snack tasty no problems. Later EWR to LHR again food fine and snack quite acceptable. We had no problems on 3 flights - only thing to complain about having to pay for t.v from SFO to EWR.,9united-airlines,13/10/14,Manchester to New York before flying to Las Vegas - all flights with United. Staff were terrible. They were completely uninterested in any one of the passengers and we we're treated as a huge inconvenience. The food was horrendous. When we flew from New York to Vegas things got even worse - we had a 5-hour flight with no entertainment. If we wanted something to eat or drink they wanted paying for it and the prices were ridiculous - the free tea coffee or juice were disgusting so we stayed away from them for the entire flight. Again the crew were abysmal to say the least. We will never fly with United again. We have travelled a lot of long haul in the last ten years and I have never experienced anything as shoddy as United - what a start to the holiday you spend forever saving up for.,2united-airlines,13/10/14,Travelled on a connecting flight from Toronto to Houston TX en route to Rio de Janeiro. Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.,3united-airlines,08/10/14,Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.,1united-airlines,08/10/14,We had a great experience with United Airlines on our return flight from Ottawa (Canada) to Phoenix connecting through Chicago O'Hare. Our flight to Phoenix was smooth and on time. The only thing missing was inflight entertainment. Our return flight was complicated by the fact that a disgruntled employee set a fire to a centre governing the flights through both Chicago airports on the Friday before our Sunday departure. We called the United 1-800 number and got through to an agent quite quickly. She was extremely helpful and could not find us an alternate flight with United so arranged for us to take a flight from Phoenix to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Ottawa with US airways. We departed and arrived at a very similar flight to our original flight with United. This was the best service that I have ever received in a difficult situation like this. We had a very tight connection on the way back and our baggage arrived on the flight with us. Good job United!,9united-airlines,05/10/14,Flew from Tucson AZ to Kona HI today. Horrible trip!. In Tucson the ticket agents argued and snapped at each other in front of the customers. The Tucson-LAX portion was fine the flight attendant was very professional and as I was traveling with a handicapped companion she was very helpful. The flight from LAX to Kona Hawaii however was awful. The flight attendants were rude short tempered and often ignored passengers questions. This was a five and a half hour flight to not even provide peanuts as a snack is ridiculous considering the cost of the food available for purchase. I will say the ground crew in Tucson LAX and Kona were fantastic and really went out of their way to help out. My issue is that the ground crew doesn't work for United and I didn't buy my ticket from them. United seriously need to work on their customer service relations!,1united-airlines,05/10/14,On a recent trip we flew 3 times with United. The first flight was on 9 September and we flew from Vancouver to Denver with a stopover en route to Albuquerque. These seats were all booked by a travel agent and confirmed 5 months prior to travel. On the first flight my husband and I were seated separately - I was seated behind my husband. We were given water and/or soft drink during the flight. The attendants were very brisk and almost rude in the 'service' they offered. But the flight did leave and arrive on time. The connecting flight however was not such a straight forward experience. When we went to the check-in we were informed by the staff that the flight had been over booked and that we at that stage were the over booked people. They did not apologise in fact they treated us very rudely. They spent the next hour and a half offering 2 passengers other flights hotel accommodation and $500 flight vouchers each in an effort to allow us to board the flight. Eventually and approximately 3 mins before the flight doors were to close after boarding and after I stood at the counter for around 10 mins they informed me that we could board. Again we were seated separately with my husband at the back of the plane and me sitting at the front. Never any apology. Our third flight was on the 13 September and we flew from Albuquerque to LAX in readiness for our flight back to Auckland NZ. The staff at the airport were again rude. Our flight left more or less on time and the flight staff were great bright and friendly. They actually appeared to be enjoying their job and treated the passengers with friendliness and courtesy. We actually managed to sit together on this flight.,1united-airlines,05/10/14,"I have the United app and I was checking on the situation in Chicago from the day before - was not told anything until I was stuck in the airport away from freedom when the agent told me the first leg into Chicago was delayed 2 hours and the 2nd leg from Chicago to San Diego had a connection I was not going to make because of the time I get in - it was the last flight out of Chicago for the night. The Agent was amazing and put me on another airline that would get me home to my family. Forever grateful! Once on the plane to Chicago the 1st class flight attendant was very attentive and extremely caring. When I asked if there were any snacks she said that the previous flight had depleted the stock. When I informed her about my birthday flights and the problems I was having she went all out. She offered me her own personal snack out of her purse with a smile. Selfless and sincere. She was a blessing to my day. As I left she handed me a ""care package"" of treats she was able to scrounge up on the plane for and offered me a happy birthday wish. She and the gate attendant both made my long hours and travel home to my family not just bearable but enjoyable.",10united-airlines,05/10/14,FRA-IAD and next morning IAD-MIA in business. FRA-IAD flight had to return to gate to get some loose freight container fixed so plane left with 2 hour delay. Otherwise flight was fine. Seats were reasonably comfortable entertainment OK. The inflight service was excellent with a delicious menu and very attentive flight attendants who regularly walked around with drinks and snacks. Baggage delivery at IAD was very fast. Domestic connection next morning also fine. Friendly and efficient check-in. Seats were comfortable and flight left on time. On the domestic leg they served drinks and a warm cookie. Baggage delivery on arrival reasonably quick.,7united-airlines,05/10/14,I recently traveled from Arkansas where I was visiting my family back to Honolulu HI where I am currently stationed in the US Air Force. On the last flight as I was boarding I was informed that my seat had been moved. When booking the flight I paid extra to have an exit row aisle seat because I have bad knees and needed the extra leg room. I was instead placed in the middle seat of a non exit row. The staff made no explanation regarding my seat change did not offer their apologies and did not seem to have any concern over the money I had lost paying for a seat that I did not end up having. I am extremely frustrated with this service and will encourage all of my friends to fly with a different airline. This kind of treatment is unacceptable.,3united-airlines,05/10/14,First class sure isn't what it used to be. On a round trip from Dulles to Vegas both times they ran out of cereal before they took my breakfast order so all they had to offer were some nasty eggs broccoli casserole and dried out croissants. Apparently they only stock enough cereal for 1/2 of first class? Really? For a $1378 ticket I want my freaking cereal not food poisoning. The clincher was that they charge first class passengers for wi-fi access. They should be ashamed. Only a half notch above economy if that much.,3united-airlines,05/10/14,SYD-SFO-SYD: Flew in late September. I got the same plane for both legs of the journey which looks rather old. There appears to be more Economy Plus seats than Economy seats. Plane had a dodgy IFE for the entire section of seats I was seating. My own AVOD was jammed and could not be reset. Food was barely edible for dinner but it got better for breakfast and drinks were forthcoming. Legroom was okay. From the US leg I had to use the kiosk to check in but it refused to print my ticket and required a staff to assist me. I was disappointed with quality of the airline overall because I would have expected US-based airlines to have a superior standard. If you are flying on a budget this may be for you but otherwise you might want to look elsewhere.,5united-airlines,05/10/14,Our flight from Boston to Denver was delayed by an hour. We approached the service desk in Boston when notified about the delay because we had a very short layover on our way to Seattle. We were told all connecting flights would be fine and that they would make up the time in the air. It wasn't until we were almost to Denver that they bothered to inform us of the added time to the flight and we arrived just in time to see our next plane depart. They did put us up in a hotel for free and got us on the next flight out the next morning only to have that plane stop mid-takeoff due to a plane malfunction. If the staff had been gracious and accommodating during this nightmare it might not have been so bad but they had the nerve to tell us it was our fault for not having a longer layover (as if we had a choice). Never flying with United again if we ever get back to Seattle.,1united-airlines,05/10/14,SFO-LAS short flight on a 737 - flight departed about 25mins late arrived a bit late seats comfortable for a short flight. The flight did what it said on the tin. However in my years of flying I've seen nothing like it! Onboard no crew at the door sat down and noticed people across from me put three large bags by their feet and then put tray tables down to cover them. Crew failed to spot this on a few occasions but eventually did ask 'can you put your tray table up' walked away before they seeing the bags. Crew served drinks by just looking at you no thank you no hello nothing! The flight had a free gift of cards given out - thrown at you of course. On leaving the flight the crew were at the front chatting. First time I've flown United is the last based on crew attitude - no smile no communication.,2united-airlines,28/09/14,"My initial flight from CA to Denver was delayed for 2 hours - no explanation. From this delay I missed the connecting United flight from Denver to Peoria. I was given tickets to flyig into Chicago - arriving 2 am with a ticket to Peoria the following morning. Of course no luggage as it was already re-routed and person at ticket counter at 2 am did not have access into the ""holding"" area. Traveling with my sister we were left in Chicago 2am - no hotel - no luggage- no vouchers- just be back in morning for 8 am flight to Peoria. United could do so much better with customer service - none of the United attendants seem to be concerned about a flight filled with unhappy customers - they just repeat their scripted message. The attendant at the end handing out flight information was rude to anyone who asked a question.",1united-airlines,28/09/14,My husband and daughter had nothing but troubles with their recent flights. Part of their flight home (a 50 min flight from Chicago to Green Bay) was cancelled with no alternatives. They ended up having to rent a car to get home in time for the next day of work and school. United did not offer any compensation for the cancelled flight nor the car rental. Their customer service lacked immensely and the communication on the flight cancellation was obsolete. We will never fly with United again!,1us-airways,27/07/15,"Arriving at Orlando airport there was nothing less than disorganized chaos by the check in. Staff were extremely slow for simple bag check-ins as well as unfriendly and unprofessional. Flight was delayed 4 hours because the crew needed time off. Does US Airways only have one crew available? The flight finally got off the ground 4 hours and 45 minutes later than scheduled. Because I was just taking a day trip to Philadelphia to drop off someone who had a 10 hour layover it ended up being a waste of money for me. For my return flight from Philadelphia they announced that there would be a 10 minute delay because - you guessed it - they were short on personnel. The 10 minutes turned into over an hour before they could get a first officer and 2 flight attendants. The service on board on both flights was poor. The attendants were cold and impersonal. The gate personnel at Orlando were the absolute unfriendliest I have seen in over 45 years of flying. US Airways used to be a good airline that I enjoyed flying with, but since the fusion they are just a shadow of what they used to be and even worse than their partner American Airlines. I won't be using them anytime in the near future again.",1united-airlines,28/09/14,"Tel Aviv to Newark in Business Class. Security was quick but the airline did check for beverages in the carry-on bags as I entered the 777-200 airplane don't purchase drinks for the flight. One hour forty-five minutes after a smooth take-off they turned off the fasten seatbelt sign but then turned it back on four minutes later. A recorded message said ""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. Please make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened"". The flight attendants then repeated the message in English and Hebrew. This happened five more times during the 12 hour flight which made sleeping difficult. Breakfast was served one hour before landing and the flight attendants did a great job. It would be nice if they could turn down the volume of the recorded message as it made sleeping difficult.",5united-airlines,28/09/14,"I am currently sitting on a brand new United Airlines plane using their ""United Airlines WiFi Beta"". First off I am sitting in front of an exit row. I was never notified that my chair will not recline. Why did United notify me when I was selecting my seat? Next question why does United Airlines WiFi Beta not allow video streaming? GoGo WiFi works very well given the circumstances of being inflight when streaming videos. If you are going to force your passengers to use your WiFi please offer a superior solution than what currently exists or just use GoGo or another service that already does a great job. Why was I not notified that this brand new plane would not have TVs? I expected to have TVs in a brand new plane. If these new planes must have so many hours to be certified before TVs can be installed why do passengers not receive a discount on the flight and notified before purchasing the ticket? I feel like the staff the plane and the overall experience is geared to ""securing"" your safety which is great but every airline does that. Please don't use ""my safety"" as an excuse to give poor service. I can hop on a safe flight with any airline I want an airline who thinks of the small things that I mentioned above. They have the capital they have the people how do they miss the small things I mentioned above?",3us-airways,20/07/15,"I can't say enough good things about the customer service I received on 20 July from their staff. Kayak had screwed things up with my reservation, but US Airways helped me out and showed compassion and efficiency. This is not the first time I have spoken to them and they have given me such good service. I appreciate it so much and that is why I am writing this review. I haven't flown yet, but they have made it possible for me and took care of the mess that Kayak caused. I actually haven't traveled yet, but have to fill out the fields below - I am hoping I am correct giving four stars (as I rarely, if ever, give five).",10us-airways,19/07/15,"Returning to LAX on family holiday trip from San Juan PR was a nightmare: Plane left late from SJU arrived at CLT (Charleston, NC) almost on time - but - plane sat on tarmac for 40 minutes, resulting in missed flight to LAX, last flight of the night. Rebooked for same flight - 24 hours later. No vouchers, no food coupons, no apologies. Delays were admittedly due to weather in CLT and air traffic control response, but given that trip was booked all legs through AA/US Airways, would have thought airline could hold last flight for connecting passengers known to be waiting on tarmac for gate to make connections. Many upset AA/US Airways passengers were in evidence at Charlotte ""International"" Airport. Additionally, rampant, repeated misinformation and; unhelpfulness from US Airways/American Airlines customer service and airport staff. Were told by airport staff at gate we could reclaim luggage at baggage claim - could not be more wrong, they would not ""pull bags"" so I, wife and 2 kids stuck in Charlotte for 24 hours. Moreover, had purchased $200 liquor in Duty Free in SJU, but, due to TSA regulations and because we left the secure area, have had to improvise and box bottles for check-through on rescheduled flight - another $25 fee too boot. Don't know if they'll let me check (am writing from a hotel near airport during my 24 hour ""layover""). Even better - flight crew was at baggage claim and unable to find accommodation for the night - so AA/US Airways not only jerking around customers but crew as well (not surprisingly). You'd think they'd have contingency plan for these sort of events as a rested flight crew is allegedly critical to FAA safety requirements, but they were in the same pickle as we - completely and utterly out of luck! Was loyal AA booster and flier for years, even enjoyed ""Sapphire"" status at one point, but will never fly AA/US Airways again if there is a-n-y other option.",1united-airlines,28/09/14,"Newark to Munich in Business Class with a rude Continental crew. When I plugged in my headset which was located behind me my tablecloth came off my tray and the flight attendant said ""your making a mess."" When I got up to use the toilet in the back of the Business Class cabin the toilet was occupied so I waited in the aisle because I know flight United flight attendants don't like people waiting in their galley. With a hand motion the flight attendant told me to move back another few inches. Breakfast was served 1.5 hours before landing. The fasten seatbelt sign had been on for five hours straight and passengers were told to prepare for landing. The plane was still at 36000 feet and there was still 40 minutes before landing. Within one minute the flight attendant was moving my seat to the landing position and said ""your not paying attention."" It doesn't take 40 minutes to prepare for a smooth landing. If you are looking for a pilot that says I'll be turning the fasten seatbelt sign on soon for landing so if you need to use the restroom now would be a good time to do this don't pick this airline.",3united-airlines,28/09/14,Took an economy class flight from Burlington to Bogota with a stop in Newark. On the flight over from Newark to Bogota a 6 hour flight the AC was on full blast I was freezing so I asked the flight attendant for a blanket told that they don't provide blankets or pillows. They don't provide food on the flight! A 6 hour international flight without food is unacceptable they want you to pay 10$ for poor quality plane food. On top of all of the above mentioned you have to pay for inflight entertainment 7.50$ for 4 hours! In summary I had a 6 hour flight with no food no entertainment and freezing up.,2united-airlines,22/09/14,I've been a Mileage Plus member and a United frequent flyer since 1995. The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!,8us-airways,19/07/15,"The check-in process was good, flight on time, comfortable seats. My major concern was the flight attendants we encountered. Out of four flights on this trip, we only had one attendant that we did not overhear complain about the airline. We sat in exit rows on all the flights, and in seats that allowed conversation with them. We specifically chose a window seat for one of our legs of the trip, but the flight attendant made a mistake and thought we were in the wrong seat because another passenger thought he had the window seat exit row. The attendant told us we were wrong, so we made the move per request, then quietly pointed out we had been in the correct seats all along. The attendant apologized, but didn't ask the other passenger to move to his ticketed seat. My husband had circulation problems, so we specifically wanted the seat we had requested as it allowed more leg room. When the beverage cart came by, we did ask for a complementary rum and coke to compensate us, which we did receive. I would have to think twice before flying with US Airways again. ",4us-airways,18/07/15,"Not only are the flight attendants rude, but the service is terrible. I took a simple 1.5 hour flight that was supposed to leave at 12 pm. Nope - cancelled, placed on a connecting flight at 2.45, arrive, have my gate changed to the other side of the airport without prior notification and then the connecting flight to my final destination was delayed three times.

The worst thing that has happened is United merging with Continental. Having been a million mile flyer on Continental I find the flight schedules on United a total mess. Always a hub connection whether it's Chicago Denver Houston Cleveland LA or San Francisco always inconvenient and time consuming. Boarding process is archaic Southwest can unload reload and leave in the time it takes United Passengers to Board. Always delays and excuses. Give me Southwest any day no Mickey Mouse seat charges baggage charges have a decent amount of non stop flights plus at least you get peanuts more than I can say I get from United's unhappy flight attendants.,3united-airlines,22/09/14,Very dissatisfied! Today I had a flight from Charleston to Phoenix with a one hour lay over in Houston. Very little time to switch terminals but scheduled by United. While waiting I learned the Charleston flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Told by flight attendant that this is due to one crew member coming late to the flight causing the delay. Now I have 30 min to get to flight which will not happen and have to stay night in Houston. United has reserved flight at 07.30 next morning. Problem: Parking has been prepaid on my vehicle only until my arrival time. My luggage is already in Phoenix as it left on earlier flight. No reservations in Houston for stay. No meal arrangements. I will refuse to travel with United in the future. Just a note. United has offered meal vouchers and hotel.,1us-airways,18/07/15,"$25 for each checked bag is definitely a negative in my book. The flight itself should include your luggage fee. The way this airline does seating is entirely asinine - you can book your flight at any time, but you have to wait until within two weeks of the flight to actually pick your seats. The flight was very loud and the lights and air conditioners at each seat were difficult to adjust, at some points feeling as if they would break if you tried to point the air toward you. Snacks all have to be paid for rather than being included, which also seems ridiculous when the flight already costs so much. I probably will never voluntarily fly with US Airways (or American Airlines for that natter) in the future. Other airlines have free bag checks and plenty of snacks on board at no extra cost.",2us-airways,17/07/15,"Delayed due to hydraulic issue. We're not given any food or drinks as outlined in their policy. Missed connection to Glasgow and were put on same flight the following day. Despite the fact they advertise as being part of one world they could not fly us to Glasgow via London as they are not partners with British Airways. Queried food and drinks policy only to be told they were not a canteen service and wouldn't be looking after a grown man! Had to fight to get food voucher - $10! Needed to get dinner, breakfast and lunch before the flight. Couldn't even get our luggage out of baggage reclaim. Sent to a terrible run down hotel.

As usual the leg room felt the same as cheap economy seat the space between two aisle seats was the same. Trolley kept hitting passengers. The food was of poor quality on both legs. The seat were sold by their agent claiming that the Economy Plus class is just as good as Premium class of other airlines and few hundred pounds cheaper.,1united-airlines,19/09/14,"The first leg of my trip from Buffalo NY Washington D.C.

Never have I flown another airline with this kind of awful service small airplanes and old smelly seats pretty uncomfortable for business class. Rude attendants was quite bossy boarding is odd you have a business boarding pass and start wondering how many people fit in that section of the plane before they allow you to board. I have a feeling they inherited the bad service from Continental.

I am not complaining that they don't provide any food or baggage services etc. but basic courteous behavior among the staff was absent. My flight was after 8/00pm and when asked why the food items listed on the inflight menu were not available, I was rudely told that the timings are mentioned in the menu.

If you're tall or overweight you are in for a world of pain. I upgraded my seats, and then they ended up putting me on another airline because my original connecting flight in Dallas was having maintenance issues and I wouldn't have made it home. They put me on an Alaska flight from Chicago to PDX in the middle seat for 4.5 hours. To add insult to injury, they still charged me for the upgrade even though I had to switch airlines. Essentially, I was charged $95 more for a considerably worse seat.",1united-airlines,19/09/14,LAS-ORD-AMS. I try to like United but the delays have become too much. Initially booked LAS-IAD and onward SN connection to BRU. Aircraft change on LAS-IAD led to being bumped onto LAS-ORD-IAD-BRU. Unworkable as ORD layover was only 50 minutes and my parents on separate ticket weren't bumped. Ultimately accepted change to LAS-ORD-AMS on UA metal but with upgrade to E+ for trouble which was appreciated. Tight layover of 75 minutes in ORD. Morning LAS-ORD flight delayed 60 minutes despite good weather across the country. UA agent offered next day's flight if we missed our connection I had to push hard and literally read out each flight number on alternative LH LX and UA flights. Agent was in the end helpful in taking my instructions protecting us on LH flight from ORD-FRA-AMS if flight was missed. Stress remained high; paid for Wifi on ORD to monitor situation. Arrival gate repeatedly changed adding to stress of possible connection success. All the while ORD-AMS flight delayed 40 minutes yet never appeared on UA website or advised by crew throughout LAS-ORD flight. Frantic disembarkment of flight and did not learn of delay until arrived at gate. Set aside improving its operation UA could avoid stress and hassle of employees and pax if it could at least learn how to communicate situations and update flight status's. Seatmate had experienced same mess the day before but unfortunately did have to wait 24 hours for the next UA flight to AMS. ORD-AMS an hour late though ironically great news for us. The infamous and ancient B763 Ghetto Bird window covered in sticky goo but led to free apology wine from FA after I called attention to it and personally cleaned it. Announcements in Dutch noticed and appreciated. Crew notably pleasant. Baggage made connection which was merciful. Food markedly worse than AC and European carriers. Delays are too routine however and with the watering down of MP program I have already actively booked away from US carriers when flying to Europe on next two flights both from the States and Canada. Return on AC B772 was on time and more comfortable all around - food IFE seat.,3united-airlines,19/09/14,As a Platinum customer I fly a lot with United and it is amazing how bad United has become over the last 5 years. Not only did they delay today's departure for a little bit of rain in DC and called it a thunderstorm but they also let our connection leave without us for our honeymoon. I am less frustrated when it is a business trip as I always expect that United does not make its connections. Last year I did not have a single flight on time and missed 6 flights. The business class had very uncomfortable seats the staff made the same announcement every 20 minutes for about 2 hours that we would be a little bit late. Then they made another announcement that someone would be waiting with information for us in Munich. All we were told at Munich airport was to go to the Lufthansa Service Center. The service agent sen us immediately to the departure gate but did not let the airplane know that there were multiple customers coming. So the plane left 5 minutes before we arrived at the gate after a wild goose chase through Munich airport. After flying for years and being vegetarian I usually bring my own food as I am over the monotonous and tasteless food they serve but today I flew business and I wanted some champagne and a meal. It is always the same and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the dessert has also not changed in the last 5 years. The purser came and apologized in person big deal however she did not have any information for those that got stranded in Munich.What about their new security video between images with kangaroos and people sitting in seats on the beach you get completely lost in their new bizarre security video. As an educator I can guarantee that not 1/3 of people have afterwards a clue of what was said because this looks more like a reality TV series or a bad infomercial. I have been to Africa Peru and Europe on three long flights and the movies between these directions do not change. In the last 6 weeks I have seen almost all of what is worth seeing so that's why I gave the Entertainment 1 star. All in all stay away from United flying with United is no fun anymore the individual customer does not make any difference to United.,1us-airways,13/07/15,"Our flight to Charlotte was delayed due to weather in Charlotte.

They never advised us to check back every 15 minutes like they are supposed to do as I found out later. We went to get something to eat and when we came back in much less than an hour we found the plane had left without us. It also left with our valuable instruments we had gate checked! We finally convinced the customer service lady to please have somebody meet the plane and store the instruments until we could finally get there. The return trip was no better as they cancelled us from the return flight because we had missed our original flight from Phoenix. We had to fight to get back on the plane. The return flight was no better! If you fly US Air be ready to hear ""We are so sorry but your flight has been delayed because of 'insert reason' and we will get you in the air as soon as possible"".

Reason given was bad weather in Little Rock area. No bad weather in area so that was a bogus excuse. Re-routed to Chicago into LIT. Missed connecting flight in Chicago. Finally caught flight to LIT at 8.30 pm. Upon arrival at LIT could not get bags which had come in on an earlier flight. Terrible service and nobody involved seemed to care.,1united-airlines,17/09/14,Had a very bad experience with United Airlines. While travelling from EWR to MSP we boarded the aircraft and were kept sitting for 1 hour then we were told that there were some technical issues so we changed aircraft. Second aircraft also made us wait for one and half hours due to a fuelling issue. Coming back from MSP to EWR the flight was delayed an hour. I will never fly again with United.,2united-airlines,17/09/14,ORD-AMS overnight on B767 in Biz Class lousy service by uninterested cabin staff food barely edible. Late departure late arrival. Will try to avoid.,5us-airways,12/07/15,"Short hop from BWI to PHL as part of a long haul connection from PHL-DOH-KUL. What a dreadful airline! From beginning to end, it was such a hassle for a 25 minute flight. At BWI, they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in. On the short flight, there was no beverage service but that is a small matter. On the whole, I will do everything possible to avoid US Air in the future. Ground services were appalling.",1us-airways,11/07/15,"This was the most horrible experience. We were trying to leave BWI, when we got a phone call saying we were an hour delayed. Okay, it happens. Someone from the airline was checking the people with connecting flights to make sure they could still make it, he said we ""should"" make it. Well, we had a gut feeling ""should"" wasn't enough so we went to another counter. They said we would have to change our flight because we would only have 4 minutes to make it to a gate on the other side of the airport before the flight departed. We wouldn't have eaten calmly and taken our time to do things if we were told that to begin with! So they tell me we will have to stay an extra 5 hours sitting at the airport to our connecting flight or that we would have to pay for a hotel and stay the night in Charlotte, they wouldn't pay, but regardless I had to be in Charleston that night. So I asked to be refunded because it was not sounding like great options. There was a sweet lady that helped us and told us to let the flight attendant know we had to make our earlier flight as soon as we landed. However when we got onto the plane about 2 hours later, they delayed us another 30 minutes because of traffic. We wanted to leave, I would make it driving down south faster than flying (and a lot cheaper), but a nice lady on the plane saw how upset we were and helped calm us down. She then explained that we wouldn't be able to make it to our earlier flight, but that we could ask the help desk to get us seats on the 10:30 flight, or have the airline pay for our hotel to leave the next morning because the delay was due to ""maintenance"" issues. We had no choice so she met us as we landed and tried to help us find an airport nearby our original location for a friend to pick us up at. Her shift was over and was beyond sweet for helping us for so long. She actually found us a flight leaving 15 minutes after we landed but they wouldn't have been able to deliver our luggage. So we took the seats on the 10:30 flight and of course without sitting together (I get anxious so I always need someone, so my fiancÃ© and I were upset). We sat there and of course, they say they have to change a tire that would take a bother 30 minutes. That whole trip ended up totaling 11 hours after delays, maintenance, and layover.  The worst $700 spent for a mediocre travel that could have been avoided if they had their act together.",1us-airways,11/07/15,"Flights on time. Baggage handling was fine this time around.

When I got to the airport I was advised the flight had been cancelled earlier that day. The ticketing agent said there were no available flights so I was stranded in Indianapolis until the next morning. She was unwilling to offer any hotel or any other compensation. The only available flights the next day had layovers instead of being direct. I took a United flight easily from IND to ORD the next morning. However the flight from ORD to IAD on UA382 was horrible. We boarded the flight late because there were so many people on standby. Then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours because they said they needed to refuel. Supposed to land at 11:39am but arrived after 1.30 pm.,1united-airlines,17/09/14,On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.,2us-airways,10/07/15,"US Airways Express. We arrived very early for an afternoon flight  and asked if possible to change to earlier flight. Customer service lady very kind and helpful - changed it to 11.15 am flight no extra charge. Boarding smoothly, small plane. Allocated 2 seats and prefer that configuration. Only 1 flight attendant with a good sence of humour. We were unaware that flight from Philadelphia to New York was only 19 minutes so quickest flight we have ever been on. Only negative is we prefer life jackets in case of emergency not flotation cushions on bottom of seats. The main thing is we arrived safely. ",6us-airways,10/07/15,"I got to the airport early and the flight was on time. We boarded the airplane and taxied onto the tarmac. We sat on the tarmac for around 45 minutes, and then got an announcement that we had to go back to the terminal for maintenance issues. We were told we had a minimum wait time of 45 minutes and that we could get off the plane if we wanted. I got off the plane to go get some food, when we were called back to the plane we had to re-board. Re boarding took about 20 minutes. Luckily we got onto the tarmac without any trouble. We had a normal flight and landed in LA three hours late. We were about to go to a terminal when we were told that since we were late we had to wait a minimum of 45 minutes to get a terminal. We had to wait for 1.5 hours. Overall, not a very good experience.",1united-airlines,14/09/14,After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.,1united-airlines,14/09/14,UA5260 IAH-LIT. Uncomfortable seats unacceptable number of delays in Houston. Lack of concern for inconvenience caused to passengers is unacceptable. These tactics are a sign of pure greed.

However, at Philadelphia after we collected our luggage to put them on the next track for our connecting flight, we then found out our next flight was cancelled. The people at baggage were unaware of this, no announcement, nothing. We only found out from a digital board after giving our luggage away. We then went back to see if there was a chance in receiving our luggage so it wouldn't leave without us and the response from a US Airways worker was ""no sorry"" when asked if there were any other flights that night through this airline again the response was ""no the next is 9.20 tomorrow"", we asked if there was a different airline to our final destination we again heard ""no there's not"" not very helpful at all! We also asked if there was any way to get reimbursed for a car rental or a hotel for the night and again, ""no we can't do that sorry"" why not? That's just the question. It isn't our fault the flight was cancelled. The least they could do was announce it.",6us-airways,07/07/15,"Took family on trip from Chicago to Las Vegas.

We were in line at least 60 minutes prior to flight, and completed automated process 45 minutes prior. At least 15 others not allowed to board. Staff at Phoenix were friendly and apologetic.

On September 3rd they changed gates twice making it difficult for a senior to get to. Today September 10th they are delaying again for the same reason. This means that I'll miss my LA connection because this flight will arrive after the plane leaves that airport. I'm going back to Alaska they can schedule planes to flights.,1united-airlines,14/09/14,LHR-SFO. Connecting to this flight from Brussels on Brussels Airlines maybe 4 or 5 folks on this flight going to the SFO flight. Brussels flight late connecting time tight for LHR (scheduled for 70 minutes more like 25 with the late flight and you have to go through security to get to US). Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me. Food reasonably good; had a chicken dish for lunch that was quite tasty actually. Overall a nice easy flight after working up a sweat running to the gate.,8us-airways,06/07/15,"Here are the basics: flight delayed twice, no sign change put up at the gate, over 100 people waiting in line for over and hour, since the sign said it was boarding the entire time with no announcement. 25 People waiting in line to book a new connecting flight since the now delayed flight (which we had to figure out on our own) would make everyone miss their connection, we are not spoken to, rather told to board the plane with a ""50/50 shot you could rebook your connection in Dallas.""

Never again will my money go towards this airline or their partners.",1us-airways,06/07/15,We're flying US Airways for the second time in two weeks and I'm not impressed! Both times the flight from Phoenix to Tampa was delayed due to maintenance issues. Are the planes in that bad shape or is there something else going on such as scheduling difficulties? It would be easier to take if the employees were a little more accommodating and apologetic instead of downright rude.,3united-airlines,14/09/14,I have to say I was extremely hesitant after reading the reviews on this site and due to fly with UA on 22nd August 2014. I had 5 flights covering a 3 week period and flew from Glasgow - Newark- Las Vegas - San Fran - San Diego back to Newark - Glasgow and was totally happy with the service provided to my family and I. We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them. Will definitely be recommending UA to anyone who asks.,7united-airlines,14/09/14,Just returned from USA flying both ways with United. 3rd flight this year flying with United to SFO connecting to ACV (Eureka). United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,7us-airways,02/07/15,"Our travel on Monday, June 8, 2015 on flight #444 from Cabo San Lucas to Phoenix, Arizona with connecting flight of #422 to Omaha, Nebraska same day. As we were waiting for our flight in Cabo, the gate numbers were changed four times, everyone seemed confused and no information was given to passengers other than it had been delayed and moved. Finally the plane left about 45 minutes late due to maintenance problems. No information was given to us that we would not make our connecting flight to Omaha. No information was given on the plane. No information was given when we disembarked and headed for Customs. No information given that the gate of our connecting flight had been changed. We were uninformed of any changes! We ran to our gate of B26 for flight #422, we made it and found no one there. We finally found a monitor and found that it had just been changed to A6 at the opposite side of the airport.

We all (9 others) were glad to have made our flight. We were told 1) that there were no empty seats. 2) we were too late and it was our fault. 3) then after pressuring the attendant, she found that our seats had been given to other people and that we had been put on another flight #462 to Dallas and then #5675 to Omaha the following day.

On the return trip from LAS to SFO and then to Hong Kong. 1) Old planes - the planes are so old you don't even get your own personal TV. I remember flying in the 1990s to be just like that when inflight entertainment runs over the large monitor in the front. How is anyone near those screens ever going to sleep on the long flights? 2) Food just is bad. You need to pay for alcoholic drinks. Really? You can't price that into the ticket? 3) Check in at LAS is a nightmare. The auto check-in machines don't really work and require a lot of manual intervention from the staff but there's probably 2 staff serving about 2 dozen machines. 4) Seats are bad.,1united-airlines,10/09/14,If I could give United Airlines 0 stars I would. United is a horrible airline with awful customer service unreliable departures dirty airplanes and rude stewards. I booked my ticket 6 months in advance and was bumped to a different later flight about a month prior to my trip. I called the airline and was able to be placed on my original flight. The customer service representative offered no sensical explanation as to why I got bumped. I wanted to ensure I would not be charged for their mistake. The representative assured me I would not be. Well that was not the case. On the day of my flight I found out I had double reservations for two different flights and was charged twice. I immediately called customer service to rectify the situation. I was on the phone for over an hour and the situation was handled horribly. I am beyond disappointed and disgusted with their lack of professionalism. As frequent traveler for both personal and professional purposes I will never fly United again.,1us-airways,01/07/15,"I'm currently stuck on my flight while writing this review.

Every trip has had a flight delay by an hour or more. Customer service is always rude and no one cares to help you or help make your travels easier! I try to avoid flying with them as much as possible unless I know I have no choice. I recently traveled to PHX from Charlotte and they delayed my flight for over an hour because of a ""Maintenance"" issue. It's a nightmare and I will no longer choose to travel with US. Horrible service and constant delays!",2united-airlines,10/09/14,After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it. Airline food has never been great but it's reached a new low. United should be ashamed of their service. We won't fly with them again.,1united-airlines,10/09/14,"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.",1us-airways,29/06/15,"I've flown US Airways many times and it always seems like there's some sort of problem. Delays, cancellations, overbooking etc have made it so there's always some issue when I fly with them. A couple of weeks ago, a flight was canceled for some unknown reason and I had to fly into a city that was two hours away from my destination instead of having to wait in the airport overnight for the next flight. For the latest example, my brother and I were flying out of NC and were told by the ticket agent that there were no seats left for us nor another person trying to fly to Charlotte. It's frustrating to be kicked off a flight that was so overbooked and there was no apology or compensation. ",2us-airways,26/06/15,"I do not blame airlines for the bad weather on June 23rd. Flights were cancelled on the East Coast. However, I found the cabin staff very unfriendly and refusing to help. Due to reconnections because of the storm I boarded a flight from Hartford to Boston via Philadelphia. I arrived in Philadelphia late due to weather and then went to the gate to load connection to Boston. The guy taking tickets actually yelled at me for being late! Finally boarded plane and was looking for a place to put my overhead bag. There was a stewardess standing at the back of the plane and a steward standing in front. Neither one offered any assistance so I asked for help to locate a place to put my bag. I was told to just keep looking! Finally a young lady got up and moved her laptop so I could place my bag in the overhead. While struggling to lift my bag a gentleman sitting in a seat got up and helped me. Meanwhile the steward and stewardess were still standing in their spots! When I sat down the steward told people to put away their computers. A man sitting across from me started putting his away when the steward came back yelling at him because his was not putting his away fast enough!

Copa can do nothing with a 'United booking' so called United in USA to find out. Flight had been cancelled although no email received. Eventually got on economy plus and gone via Houston with tight connection but made it ok. They really just get you there and back without any frills.

The nightmare began when we noticed that we (as two friends travelling together) had been assigned seats that were not located next to each other. But we were okay with this. The flight attendants were pretty friendly but drinks were only served 2 times and food was not served at all (on a 5.5 hours flight). There was the option to purchase food but in my opinion it should go without saying that complementary food is offered on a long-distance flight. Onboard entertainment was also not available for free. Furthermore the TV screens could not be turned off so we were exposed to continuing advertising which lasted the whole flight. When we finally reached our destination in San Diego we were tired starving and thirsty.,3us-airways,24/06/15,"On my way back to Canada, I chose to fly US Airways since I made a last minute booking and didnt feel like paying a full Y class fare on Air Canada. I usually fly Air Canada and Star Alliance Partners, so I chose US Airways based on them being a former partner. I was surprised, comparing the flight to Canadian airlines such as Air Canada and Westjet. The Seats were not at all what I would have expected, there was no IFE system on A319 or CRJ, but that was expected on the CRJ. Cabin Crew was very nice and pleasent. There was a complimentary Beverage service and a la carte snacks, However I found $4 US for a small pack of Pringles and $7US for a Tiny Bottle of Heineken a little steep. Seeing as this was a Domestic flight, I would understand the lack of IFE. There weren't any onboard power outlets on any aircraft. My Laptop died halfway through my flight to Philly. Safety Briefing was done by the flight crew but it seemed that they were tired of doing it. Not many were paying attention and I believe a safety video would be more effective. For the value of what I paid for, I'd say it was very much worth it.",5us-airways,22/06/15,Arrived on Qatar Airways into Philadelphia from Doha and went on to BWI on a code share flight with US airways express. Short 30 minute flight but all went well. Small plane but surprisingly comfortable. Overhead storage was limited. One flight attendant who managed to serve about 25 people soft drinks. No complaints and the flight was on time,7united-airlines,06/09/14,Flight UA3789 August 27 2014. Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service. I was flying on miles so the value was great the plane was new and comfortable the experience the pits!,2united-airlines,06/09/14,YWG-ORD-YWG: Got to the airport in plenty of time check in on United App didn't work for me so had to use the kiosk and have by far the United kiosks take the longest to fill out. Line up through security was long and slow due to only one lane being open (obviously not United's fault but still frustrating). United flight to and from Winnipeg are seldom on time and either delayed or cancelled probably about 70% of the time. It was no surprise to me that it was delayed an hour and a half. Ended up landing in Chicago about 2 hours late. On the way home mobile check in worked and the whole experience was positive. Got to the gate and seeing my flight was on time was too good to be true and it was. It moved gates and was delayed 40 minutes. Both flights were on an E145. I knew it was going to be snug so I can't really complain since I knew what I was flying on. Both flight attendants were pleasant. Overall I will not fly united anywhere other than Chicago or Denver and I'm even hesitant to fly United to those cities non stop.,3us-airways,21/06/15,"With a weather forecast of thunderstorms at the time of my departure, I went to the airport four hours early to get on an earlier flight in order to make a tight connection. Despite the fact that there were open seats on the earlier flight I was not permitted to change flights. As predicted, the thunderstorms arrived, delaying my flight 1.5 hours, forcing me to miss my connection. As a result, I had to stay in a hotel at my own expense and get up at 4am to get to the airport for my new flight. When I got to the airport it was buzzing with stranded travelers waiting to check in. The US Airways kiosks were useless because they only accept boarding passes. It was chaos. I was barely able to make my flight. I hope to never fly on Eastern/US Airways or to flight through Charlotte, North Carolina ever again.",1us-airways,20/06/15,"Ground staff in MUC was ok. Aircraft MUC-PHL was an A330-200, clean, nice leather seats. IFE was very good. Catering for Y class also excellent. Crew lacked happiness, rarely smiled but did their job. Flight touched down in PHL 3 minutes ahead of ETA given by crew on take off. PHL-CLT on A330-300. Aircraft showed its age, but crew was very friendly. ",9united-airlines,06/09/14,SFO-MSP-DEN-SFO. I was pleasantly surprised on all legs by the genuine friendliness and interactivity of the crew. I have often been critical of UA regarding their crew attitude but this was entirely the opposite and made the trip far more pleasant. Due to status I was upgraded to F from MSP to DEN. A nice bonus.,9united-airlines,06/09/14,Come on United you need to step things up! While others are proceeding forward since their merger and around the globe I feel that UA has remained stagnant in their old ways. The club in LA is just abysmal with the lack of any proper amenities. My recent fight from Los Angeles to Seattle experienced an hour delay and there wasn't any proper dine for sale option though the flights departure was around dinner time. The service standards were one that provided no less or more of what was to be done. I really wish there was a better alternative to United for Star Alliance members to travel domestically on.,3us-airways,18/06/15,"Price was the main reason I had booked this trip with US and based on the majority of the reviews I was not looking forward to the experience. How wrong could I have been. Boarded the 5 year old aircraft, an A330-200, on time and in an organised manner. Within 30 minutes crew came through with a drinks run. Wine and soft drinks free, with a fee for spirits. Lunch followed and was very tasty. Small salad, main chicken dish with a nice desert. Nothing spectacular but very edible for airplane food. The crew, all but one, seemed happy and cheerful and interacted with the passengers as they came through the cabin. They came through the cabin with another juice and water run about an hour later and after that we got an expected treat of chocolate ice cream. About an hour before landing in Charlotte we were given a tasty paninni snack and cupcake with an offer of another drink or tea or coffee. The entertainment system worked well and had a good choice of movies. I honestly could not fault these guys with the way they delivered the service and how they made an 8 hour flight fly by!",10us-airways,17/06/15,"We were to fly home from Cabo San Lucas on June 8th, to make a connection with US Airways in Phoenix and then on to Omaha that same day. This turned into 2 days. From Cabo, the plane was late by almost an hour. They never mentioned changes to connecting flights nor that we would not make it - we made it to the plane but to our surprise and 9 others they sold our seats to other people. The door was open, the plane had not left but we were not allowed to board. We were told we had to wait and fly after midnight to Dallas and then Omaha the next day. We had to fight for overnight accomodation. We had no clothes - the bags beat us to Omaha. The courtesy counter and the gate people were rude and unhelpful.",1united-airlines,06/09/14,"UA977 DXB-IAD ""Businessfirst"". Check in and boarding were smooth professional and efficient. Unfortunately that was the highlight of this flight. Food was mediocre at best. Filet was well done and not done well. Smoked salmon appetizer and salad were disappointing-small in portion and bland. Passed on dessert. Lie flat seats were coffin like in a flat position. Service was spotty. Honestly I can't understand this legacy carrier. Emirates' CEO was right when he said his economy product was better than most carrier's business class. A total disappointment but shouldn't have been surprised. Switching to Emirates in 2015.",3united-airlines,06/09/14,MAN-EWR 24/8/14 Flight UA80. I have never experienced a flight in which the crew have seemed almost desperate to pick a fight with passengers! I'm sure they were all tired and keen to get back home but aren't they being paid to attend to the needs of passengers? As well as the staff being incredibly surly I was amazed that they chose to serve a chicken dinner at 10.30am in the morning! They can't even use the rationale that they were working on the destination time zone as we were flying to the US and it would have been 3am there! Luckily the food was absolutely inedible so it wasn't an issue in the end.,2us-airways,17/06/15,"I am 76 and require a cane to walk, our seats were changed after we had adjacent aisle assigned seats 5 months prior thru our travel advisor. My wife was put 12 rows behind me, I was put into a window seat between 2 bulkheads, I am 6'2"" and 315 lbs - no room and cannot move my feet because bulkheads went to the floor. Tried to get the seat changed at the counter, after 40 minutes, they basically advised me to accept the seat or wait for another plane (to Portugal?). On board the service personnel were in a race to complete service and were somewhat rude to passengers, none of them seemed happy to be working that day. The plane had no video/TV screens and I had no tray available for the poor food service provided, could not even eat the ""meal"" provided. Talked to seatmate and found out his travel companion was also ""relocated"" elsewhere on the plane after they had seats together when they bought their tickets. My wife came up and changed seats with me the last half of the flight, found out that other passengers had their seating also changed at the last minute as well.",2us-airways,15/06/15,"The fight was oversold, both the departure and arrival gates were double booked, and baggage did not show for 45 minutes.

I do not recommend using this airline unless tickets are half the price of competitors.",1united-airlines,06/09/14,ATL-ORD-LAX 27 Aug 14 UA3542. United likes to change your itinerary at the last minute. My reservation was ATL to LAX thru Denver when made but when I went to check in I was routed through Chicago. It was an agonizing trip lasting much too long. United doesn't even give you basic horrible airplane music or rerun TV episodes. You have to pay for everything. Bad business. Not flying United for a year or 2. Maybe never.,2united-airlines,06/09/14,Unless you want to have hours of intimate contact with a stranger do not fly United! I am a small women in my 60's. United's seat size just fits me. I was in a window seat when a medium-large gentleman a little round around the edges sat next to me. This man was not obese. He overflowed his seat enough that every time he moved we were shuffled together from butt to knee. I put up with it for half an hour and then excused myself to the aisle. I paced in the back of the plane for an hour. The attendants were serving whatever they serve and saw that I was near hysteria at the thought of returning to what awaited me in my assigned seat. They did find a solution eventually. A United employee was flying coach and they switched me out with him. But the new seat was only 3 rows in front of the gentleman who had been next to me and he had to watch this seat change knowing his size overlapping mine was the cause. These conditions are set up by United in planning an aircraft with seats that are way smaller than the human population of these times. They know this and leave it to their flight attendants to deal. Other airline carriers are tight too but I have heard and witnessed that United is the worst.,1us-airways,14/06/15,"I will never be flying US Airways again. The flight I originally booked was only supposed to have a 4 hour layover in Phoenix, but I kept getting emails about schedule changes. On the day of my flight I was originally supposed to leave Phoenix for Hawaii at 4.55pm, which was a 8 hour layover. I was annoyed about the changes, but was prepared to deal with it. I then found out while at the Phoenix airport that my flight was delayed another 3 hours! But the nightmare wasn't over, about 2 hours later there was another delay for 1 hour - I was livid. I was originally supposed to arrive in Hawaii at 5.32pm. I'm now arriving at 12am. On top of that my seats on the flight coming back were messed up because of flight changes.",1us-airways,31/05/15,Flew MSP-PHL-LHR-DUS and returned DUS-TXL-ORD-MSP. The flights were a disaster from start to finish. First flight delayed out of MSP for 25 minutes. Ok that's understandable. But when we arrive in Philadelphia we are told we will have a short wait until our gate is cleared. This turns into a very long wait and we are on a tight connection. We ask the flight attendant if she could please contact our next flight and ask them to wait. She rudely says no and then offers no further response. When we finally deplaned we asked the agent at the gate if she could please contact our flight. All she did was give us directions on getting to the B concourse. After a sprint to the gate we barely make it on the final boarding call. Thankfully the flight to London was only 25% occupied at most and we were able to stretch out. The flight to DUS was with British Airways and went smoothly except for a slight 10 minutes delay. On the return flight our flight was cancelled with no reason given. We were lucky we checked early and immediately called customer service. They said they couldn't put us on another flight for about 3 hours until they finally caved in and put us on a flight departing in a few hours with Air Berlin meaning we got no sleep. The Air Berlin portion was fine. Anything operated by US or AA was a disaster but anything from their partners went fine. Lesson learned.,united-airlines,06/09/14,SFO/IAH/SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) /IAH/SFO in First on domestic Business on the international flights - 737-900 and 737-800 - pleasantly surprised by the service which was almost perfect (only 1 FA on 1 flight was rude when I was forward enough to ask about whether there would be dessert). New lounge at SFO is still pretty bad considering it's a UA hub and supposed to represent the USA to the Pacific Rim but it was adequate (although be warned the bar closes at 10.30pm sharp not so good for those of us on midnight flights). Food on 1 flight also not so great (overdone tasteless steak) but otherwise good - I think they serve starbucks coffee because it tasted so burnt I could only drink 1/3 cup even though we were going on 30+ hours with no sleep by the time we were landing in Costa Rica. All in all we were happy with the flights unexpectedly so given some prior experiences with the carrier.,8us-airways,31/05/15,I had a terrible experience with US Airways. I took them from Seattle to Amsterdam through Philadelphia. Here's what went wrong: They didn't provide me with a gluten-free meal for all 15+ hours of travel and did not apologize or make any effort to find me something from the reserves I had confirmed online and at both airports that I'd have something to eat and they confirmed both times. If I'd known I would have been irritated but at least I could have prepared! When I asked for water from the beverage cart they wouldn't give it to me because it came with the meal (which I never got) and when I finally got a crew member to stop she didn't answer me when I asked for water but came back 20 minutes later with some. The crew members were extremely hostile and rude. There was no entertainment whatsoever. The plane was a rickety old 3x3 seater which I would expect to take between states but not between continents.,1us-airways,25/05/15,Yesterday I flew PHL to LHR on the day flight departing at 9.35am EST. This very tired old plane needs to be retired pronto as not competitive at all. Sat in row 1 with bulk head in front with a seat used typically from internal US flights not a standard transatlantic seat although seat card indicated being refitted previously plane felt in a sorry state. As I am tall the bulkhead prevented me from stretching legs out at reasonable angle you would normally expect - straight was not possible. Outbound flight to PHL from LHR was with BA and was usual solid service but this was shocking by comparison and not worthy of the fare at all (had this been a night flight I would have walked back off the plane in disgust and gone with any other airline). I urge nobody to pay for Business on this route if with American from Philly until they put the modern seats in. Entertainment is provided by a Samsung ipad like device - which is good but means you put it away when food comes they aslo take them all back way before we landed so did not get to finish two movies on a 6hr flight. Tray table can not come out and sit flat unless I am sat up right - this is a nuisance. I did not like the food one bit. I was at my most happy when I got off the late plane (late leaving as someone left passport in checked luggage resulting in waiting behind 17 planes to take off at PHL) - had sat in useless seat for 8+ hours as we were late.,united-airlines,06/09/14,IAD - SAV in August. Flight was on schedule both ways which I gather is unusual. The CRJ 200 equipment designed to be uncomfortable was pretty scruffy around the edges. Non stop on this route is convenient. I fly Asian carriers where I live. The FAs while maybe not as professional as they might sometimes be are always friendly well turned out and exquisitely polite. Those on the flights I take back and forth to the US are even more impressive. So imagine my surprise when arriving at the top of the gangway I was greeted by the assigned FA's not inconsiderable rear end. Have good manners been unbundled from the basic ticket price also?,3united-airlines,06/09/14,Aug 26 UA 1683 SFO EWR. On time departure and arrival. Younger crew members more friendly than the older ones. Regular runs through the cabin with water. Captain gave regular updates. Direct TV a nice option.

Bad weather at EWR causes major problems for all airlines operating to/from there.,9us-airways,20/05/15,DUB-PHL-LAX-PHL-DUB. First experience with US and overall it was good. Good value for money pleasant and engaged cabin crew and the special meal pre ordered on the transatlantic legs of the trip was quite good by today's airline standards. A nice touch on the outbound trip was a mid flight ice cream snack and the complementary wine with meals was also appreciated. Good selection on the Transatlantic IFE but surprisingly no IFE on the U.S. Domestic A321s. Quite a limited inflight menu on domestic flights not much healthy food on offer and by the time cabin crew reached us they were sold out of most food items. Return flight from LAX to PHL was diverted to Richmond due to ATC restrictions in PHL thankfully the DUB flight was held so when we eventually got to PHL we were able to make the connection which departed 1 hour 20 mins late. In spite of this arrival in DUB was 45 mins behind schedule.,7united-airlines,06/09/14,My wife and I booked a flight through last minute.com it was really a last minute thing because we had to be in Auburn by the 22nd August 2014. We got a flight for the 21st August which involved a couple of stops. The flight was from Birmingham UK stopping at Newark NJ and then at Washington Dulles then Syracuse (outgoing). First the flight was supposed to leave Birmingham at 09.00hrs that left 3 hrs late due to technical trouble. Got to Newark NJ so late we missed the 14.50 connection to Washington Dulles. They then booked us on another flight from Newark to Syracuse that was leaving at 21.04hrs that never turned up until about 22.30 and because there was a little downpour of rain the flight was delayed it had never left Attica. We went out on to the tarmac to board the plane and was confronted with a plane that looked like something from the Fred Flinstone era. This was a tiny DHC8 turbo prop plane and we were buffeted around like a roller coaster. So for that trip we were delayed for about 12 hours. Not even a cup of tea or a glass of water was offered to the passengers. The way back was even worse we were supposed to leave Syracuse at 19.10hrs on the 2nd September 2014. Next thing you know the rain started to fall again flight cancelled for 24 hours. We had to spend our own money for a one night stay in a hotel. So instead of going from Syracuse to Washington to Brussels to Birmingham we now had to go from Syracuse to Washington to Dublin then Birmingham. I won't be travelling with them again or recommending them to anyone.,1us-airways,10/05/15,My wife and I decided to travel to Anguilla for our honeymoon and booked our flight through US Airways. Being that it was our honeymoon I decided to call US Airways and find out the cost associated with upgrading our seats. However upon my conversation with the attendant was promptly made aware that the actual flights we were on had changed and our plane was now scheduled to depart and arrive at completely different times. Not only did they replan my arrival and departure times for me but they took it upon themselves to change my seats and not even assign me to two on my return flight. I am not going to say my honeymoon was ruined however when a merge causes a company to become so big they begin rearranging your plans it begins to make sense why they shouldn't happen. On a side note if we switched the situation and decided to change our flight instead we would be paying a $200 change fee and the difference in ticket price each. Not once were we offered an upgrade for the inconvenience or a partial refund for the change of flights which appear to be less expensive. I was previously a supporter of US Air however after learning that they can take it upon themselves to rearrange my honeymoon plans you can bet I am flying another airline for business moving forward.,united-airlines,01/09/14,Aug 26 UA 1683 SFO EWR.

Bad weather at EWR causes major problems for all airlines operating to/from there.,9united-airlines,01/09/14,JFK-SFO. Ground staff at JFK could not have been more helpful. We had a connection to NRT with ANA and our reservation had some issues but it was efficiently solved by the staff and our luggage was directly tagged to NRT avoiding luggage fees despite being on two separate reservations. Flight was ahead of schedule both departure and arrival. Service on United has always been warm friendly and efficient. I'm a big fan of their service and never had an issue. While they are not as polished as most Asian carriers are they are interactive with the passengers and their service makes you feel at home. BOB options were extensive and quality was excellent. They also did frequent beverage runs despite only being a 6-hour flight. IFE system is wonderful the movie choices were great and most of which are recent Hollywood movies. The system was responsive easy to use and the moving map was of excellent quality. Overall a very pleasant flight with United.,10us-airways,10/05/15,PHX-PHL-BRU (RT) - Truly decrepit old 757s for the PHL to BRU segments combined with downright terrible inflight service made this one of the worst inflight experiences in my recent memory. Anyone who is buying a business class ticket and 'chooses' US Airways needs their head examined. For those of you who focus on One World British Airways with a LHR connection is a much better choice. That's what I'll be doing from now on.,3us-airways,06/05/15,"My husband and I were on a leisure trip from Atlanta to Phoenix. Our flight from Atlanta was delayed 3 hours due to ""Mechanical Issues"". Fortunately we flew direct and did not have a connecting flight but there were many on our flight who did. When we arrive in Phoenix there was a delay getting the cabin doors open so we could disembark. I don't know what that was all about. No explanation from crew. On our return flight from Phoenix to Atlanta again a 1.5 hour delay due to ""Mechanical Issues"". We will never fly US Airways again.",united-airlines,01/09/14,"I took a flight from Hong Kong to Newark. Appalling from the moment I stepped on the plane. The staff were very unwelcoming. My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol. Don't get me wrong I can go with out a drink for 16 hours but its a small touch to offer an alcoholic beverage as part of the service. Anyway an absolute shambles and I shall not make the same mistake of flying with United again.",1united-airlines,01/09/14,On July 3 we were bound for intercontinental flight from SFO to FRA. Departure should be at 2 pm and was announced for 6.45 pm. After some more trouble boarding started at 8.15. After a tour on the airfield the plane came back to starting point. At least we departed with a delay of nearly 8 hours. The gate staff was completely stressed with the amendment of connecting flights for other passengers. No customer voucher were given no telephone calls offered no service at all.,1us-airways,04/05/15,Returning from Cabo San Lucas our flight was delayed by almost an hour. Not usually a problem but we had to catch a connecting flight in Phoenix to Denver. After rushing through the airport we found that we had missed the connecting flight! Ok no worries we were scheduled on another flight to Denver 3 hours later. After waiting for almost 3 hours that flight was cancelled. No explanations just cancelled. The customer (dis)service person at the US Airways counter was rude arrogant and even threatened us with calling the police if we didn't leave the counter. We called his bluff and he put down the phone and printed us two boarding passes for yet another flight another 3 hours later. This flight was overbooked and we were not even guaranteed a seat. By this time I got on my iPad and booked a (surprisingly) cheap flight on another airline no fuss and we were on our way to Denver within the hour. It was just a nightmare day from start to finish but by some wild chance of a miracle we did find our luggage when we landed in Denver. Apparently the baggage handlers do know how to do their jobs. US Airways is unreliable and their people are unprofessional incompetent and downright rude. We will never fly this airline again!,1us-airways,01/05/15,Flight 747 Seattle - Charlotte - Orlando April 27th. Very disappointing trip. Mechanical problems delays lack of communication no entertainment (except the other passengers). Poor and expensive food choices. Uncomfortable cramped seats. Unprofessional flight attendants. In a country where air travel has become a national embarrassment this airline is certainly doing their best to reinforce that.,2united-airlines,01/09/14,We are a Star Alliance Gold family. We purchased Economy tickets from NRT-IAH-FLL-SCE-IAD-NRT but I later upgraded to BusinessFirst with cash. The cash upgrade cost $1400 each. On the NRT-IAH leg the first thing that I found odd was that the FA literally threw the tablecloth to/at me at the beginning of dinner service. I think he just didn't care because throughout the flight his demeanor was cold. Small things like my wife's request for water without ice were met with the glass of water with the biggest piece of ice in it. The seat was great the food was about what you'd expect at a family restaurant and I'm ok with both of these things but I really had to wonder don't people who pay to fly premium deserve at least not passive-aggressiveâ€ùservice? I guess not. The NRT- IAH departure was an hour late due to weather. We were not able to make our connection at IAH. I bet United Airlines could have helped expedite passengers (through immigration/customs/re-checking) with tight connections. Our IAH-FLL departed while we were waiting for our bags. I informed the UA rep at the baggage claim and he told me they'd rebooked us on the next mornings 06.40 IAH-FLL. I asked if I could get a meal/hotel voucher but he informed me that since it was a weather delay UA couldn't take care of us. We feared that we might oversleep the 06.40 flight because of the jetlag. I called UA to ask for another booking and though there were 4 IAH-FLL flights that day our only options were 06.40 or 20.00 departure. Their website revealed open seats on all flights but the rep explained to me that those were first class seats and we weren't eligible for them. The weather delay on departure was caused by a typhoon. IAH is also known to be quite poor at handling international flights. UA made the decision to sell NRT-IAH tickets with a 1.5-hour buffer nonetheless. Maybe it's my fault for buying it but at any rate rather than stay up all night or lose yet another day with my family we accepted a better-timed flight to MIA. Our business with UA resumed two weeks later for the SCE-IAD-NRT return to Japan we took another carrier for our FLL-MBJ and MBJ-ATL-DTW-SCE trips. I mistakenly placed a bottle of honey in my carry-on which was picked up by TSA at security. I figured that if I couldn't get to my bags I could box and check it. I saw my bags were already gone so I waited at the side of the check-in line and figured I would wait until they announced last call for SCE-IAD. The desk rep soon did so and I politely explained â€œI'd like to get this in to my checked bags.â€ù The man was the portrait of hypertension and stress. He acted as if the world were about to end. Eventually another rep nicely asked me to go get a box from the store across the hallway and I did and when I came back the stressed-out rep acquiesced and while printing the tape/tags repeated over and over â€œ The flights boarding/you've got to get on it/itâ€™s leaving.â€ùThe flight was just starting to board. I am writing this onboard IAD-NRT. We've decided that we won't fly UA again. Weâ€™ll pay more to avoid it.,2united-airlines,28/08/14,This 80 min United Express flight from Nashville to Washington D.C. was on an ancient CRJ200.

I've been in the airport waiting for my return flight for more time than it took me to fly to DC and conduct my business. I endured a perpetual game of delay and cancellation. It was a horrible night after a long and arduous day that began at 4 am in the morning. I just boarded the plane and have to go to work tomorrow morning. The service could not be worse. I will never fly US Airways ever again to Washington DC from Hartford Connecticut. I would've been better off hiring the car service. It may be more expensive but it certainly would not have been more time-consuming and it would've been much more reliable.,united-airlines,28/08/14,"My two children and I had a flight booked from Albany to Portland Oregon changing planes in Newark and Houston. I received my first delay notice via email at 10.16 due to late inbound aircraft arrival. The second one came at 4.39 pm while we were at Newark Airport due to same reason however my children and I watched the plane arrive. The plane had tons of cargo underneath. Not just baggage but tons of commercial boxes. Our plane which was originally supposed to take off at 5pm for Houston did not take off until almost 7pm which put us in Houston at 9.30 a half hour after our plane left for Portland. That was just the beginning of our frustration. As I got to the gate and went to ask the United Airline attendant about connections she said ""see the guy down there and he will help you with connecting flight."" She was just telling us what we needed to hear to get us out of her way. By the time I got to customer service at 9.45 United Airlines customer service workers were dropping like flies among a mob of very unhappy people. We are talking 10pm people at one of America's busiest airports. 10.30 I finally get with a customer service worker who gets me food voucher's taxi voucher's and a hotel voucher for a best western 25 minutes away from the airport. She said ""grab some food around the corner"". All food venues were closed. We walked down to ground transportation and were informed only yellow cabs accept taxi voucher's. Finally got a cab and made it to the hotel at 11.30. In short lies and terrible customer service. The cargo was more important than the passengers and the customer service was horrible. I guess I'll never fly United again and given the amount I travel that's a loss for them.",1united-airlines,28/08/14,Flew from SEA to AMS via ORD on July 12. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule which was welcomed since I had only 45 minutes for transfer in Chicago and 48 minutes in Amsterdam to catch inter EU flight. Service basic but good flight attendants offered beverages very frequently and food served on transatlantic flight was OK. My bags joined me a day later at my final destination but it was not UA fault. As a Silver status holder I still appreciate upgrade to Economy Plus but with new regulations for earning points in 2015 this seems to be harder to get in the future.,9us-airways,27/04/15,Route from AUS to PHL to CHO returning on AA. Check-in with 2 checked bags went smoothly. I'm AAdvantage Plat. so speed security lines and early boarding. E-190 seats in economy are wide and pretty comfortable for a 3 hour flight. No inflight Entertainment but WIFI is available. New commuter terminal at PHL is pretty good also with a new Admirals Club and large food court. Express Dash 8 flight pretty standard almost on time but noisy and bumpy for the 1 hour flight to CHO. Returned on AA was cancelled with about 3 hours notice rebooked on US at 5am the next day. Went to Airport anyway and received a hotel voucher and spent another night. Early flight from CHO meant no airport shuttle so took acb. CRJ-200 to CLT PSA CRJ seats are pretty decent much better than Mesa not service what so ever even though almost 50 minutes in the air. Connected to a CRJ-900 for the 3 hour flight to AUS. Have taken this in the past with trepidation. CRJ's just aren't that comfortable with no inflight entertainment and no Wifi. 2 Beverage runs and we were almost on time. Us Airways Express really needs to pad their times some more. All express flight seem to take longer in the air than are scheduled gate to gate. Overall they did the job but still prefer AA.,5us-airways,22/04/15,"Four flights from Phoenix to Philadelphia in April. Nice weather up and down the eastern coast. Flight from Phoenix to Charlotte taxied on the runway for 30 minutes and left 25 minutes late. Two of these flights had another crew on them flying home and they didn't have very nice things to say about their employer. Arrived in Charlotte as my next flight was just arriving ""late"". The passengers disembarked the flight cleaned and we boarded 30 minutes later and left the ground 20 minutes after that. Very little information about what was going on from the crew. Departing Philadelphia the flight boarded on-time but my original seat from what I reserved online was changed at check in and I was moved to the last seats and by a window and next to the engine. It was so loud I couldn't hear my music and had to fly with earplugs in my ears. After the captain figured out that he was on the wrong runway he told us and said there was going to be a delay of 15-20 minutes. When we finally landed at Dallas my flight was supposed to be boarding but after running to the gate the flight had been delayed due to weather and other flights. I had just come from the east coast and checked the weather and I didn't see anything that could have delayed a flight. I don't fly very much but this trip was ridiculous. No matter what the price is I wont ever fly American or US Airways.",united-airlines,28/08/14,As I near one million miles with this airline I marvel at the abuse I regularly endure. 1/3 flights have some irregularity in part because I live in a community served by UA Express. Regularly UA cancels flights nearly always on the pretext of weather. The UA rez engine never seems to find me the next available flight despite my Premier Exec status. The last 2 cancellation reported at 4.17 am for a 6.27 departure (SCE-ORD-YUL) didn't see anything available until 8.30 pm with an overnight at my expense. I called rez and got a 1pm departure after a wait list failed. 0 customer care for a loyal flyer.,1united-airlines,28/08/14,"I started off from Seattle to Ottawa. Flight was delayed by more than an hour in Seattle b/c of a ""technical problem."" Then I was stranded in Chicago for hours before I got to Ottawa after 2pm. I was supposed to get to Ottawa approximately at 9:30am. On my way back a week later I got to Ottawa airport at 4am for my 6am flight. We were told flight was canceled due to a ""technical problem"" and I was asked to come back at 2pm. I had to argue with them to get me the 11.45 flight to Chicago. Stated in Chicago for hours then arrived in Seattle close to 6pm. I was supposed to be back in Seattle approximately at 10.30am. To be fare they provided us two $8 (Canadian) food vouchers. However I will never rely on United Airlines to get me to my destination on time and I will never fly with them again.",1us-airways,19/04/15,Flew in from Pittsburgh to Charlotte on April 15. Flight was late getting in and by the time we got off of the plane and made it to our departure gate we had 14 minutes to spare. They shut the door in our faces when we tried to get on and no one would speak to us. We had two others traveling for corporate with us and they said that our seats were given away. We had to rent a car to get to Charlotte for our corporate meetings that night that cost us $300.00. Manager and customer service very rude. Never again.,us-airways,16/04/15,Flew from Washington to Boston on Economy. Arrived at the airport at 5pm for check in for 6.30pm flight. After several gate changes following a series of confusing announcements in an extremely overcrowded terminal the creeping delays started half an hour at the time. After an hour we were informed plane had landed but due to congestion there were no stands available. Finally boarding was announced at around 8.30pm after which it started to rain. We were then informed there would be a further delay due to the rain. We sat on the plane for an hour then taxied to the runway and waited another hour only to be informed that the flight would now be cancelled due to the weather. It was now after 10pm. On disembarking I was fortunate to be near the front so could be attended to quickly at the customer services desk for re-booking but I later realized others were stuck in a queue for hours late into the night. I was told flatly that all flights were full and overbooked until 10pm the next day. I was told rudely to 'take the 10pm flight or leave it' and as it was due to the weather it was not their responsibility to offer anything else (in fact the weather was just one of the contributing factors for the cancellation - the plane had already been late). I had to push and push to be offered alternative options (e.g. flights to a different airport or with layover etc). Eventually they found a flight via Philadelphia the next morning. I asked for more details and then agreed to be put on the flight only to be told I had taken too long to make a decision and now that flight was also full! I overheard other passengers being rebooked for other morning flights in adjoining desks so I have no idea what was going on. After much persuasion a seat miraculously became available at 11am the next day. Bizarre. I understand that delays and cancellations are not the fault of the customer service desk but they should at least be courteous understanding and helpful to passengers at a stressful time - not dismissive.,2united-airlines,28/08/14,Left Houston for Milwaukee after four flight delays! Return flight - I was delayed another four hours in Houston without explanation and no vouchers. Next time - American Airlines. Another dissatisfied customer!,1united-airlines,28/08/14,TPA-ORD-LHR: terrible. I know you get what you pay for but I still expect more than this for what was mainly a transatlantic trip. The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency). Surely they could stump up at least one complementary alcoholic beverage like other transatlantic carriers. Next time I'll pay more for a much superior service. This is the budget airline of the Atlantic.,3us-airways,16/04/15,"Flew from PHL to Cancun straight through trip. We were offered one drink for the 3 hours and 45 minute trip. The seats were very cramped and I had a seat directly in front of a bathroom - lucky me with the smells and all coming from the very overused and unclean restroom. We hit ""turbulence"" and the pilot had the attendants in economy sit down. But I guess the attendant in first class was ""safe"" because she continued to serve those in first class. There were no TV's movies and the trip was long and hot at times. I would give them a no star rating. I will not fly US Airways again and from the looks of the other reviews I am not alone in this decision!",us-airways,12/04/15,We booked for a flight to Seattle Washington last April 5 2015. After boarding crew told us that there will be a delay because the plane has some mechanical problems. We waited for almost 2 hours before they decided to deplane us. They told us to rebook our flight we got a flight thru Alaska Airlines at 3.40pm (originally our flight is 6.15am). We spent more or less an hour in the line for all passengers have to rebook their flight. They didn't give us anything for our inconvenience or for messing up our schedule.,us-airways,08/04/15,Portland to Philadelphia Feb 22 2015 flight #4437 then #799 to Orlando. Returned March 6th flight #1757 Orlando to Philadelphia then #4437 to Portland. A terrible experience. When booking flights it asks if you are travelling with children which I was yet not one of the three adults that were travelling were able to sit with the child. When we land in Philadelphia we go directly to the gate so that there will be no worries of us missing our flight. The time comes when we should be starting to load the plane and my husband goes and asks when will be boarding and they inform him the gate has changed which they had not announced. Us along with most of the people sitting around us run to the new gate. When we arrive they there is a delay because they have to bring in a new plane once the new plane arrives they have to clean it after an hour they tell us there are problems with the plane. We wait again and they announce the pilot has run out of time and they need to bring in another. Our 6 pm flight ends up leaving at 11.30 pm. When they do start to board the plane the lady starts yelling at everyone to hurry up like we were the reason for the plane being so late. The return flight comes around and I am thinking surely this time things will be better - wrong. We look at our tickets to see if by any chance we will have someone to sit with my son on any of the flights No. Then I notice that on one of the flights I do not have a seat number. I go to the counter and ask what does this mean and I am told I have to check at that airport when I arrive. I ask does this mean I will not be on the flights? Oh no you will be. I get to that airport and am told the flight is full I will have to wait for another flight. I said no I am travelling with three other people my husband child and elderly mother - I then wait for hours in another airport. In the end I did get on the plane. Will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.,1united-airlines,28/08/14,Paid high premium for last minute flight. Wasn't given a seat assignment because no coach seats were left and only seats toward the front which they charge $84 to sit in were left. Got seat assignment at gate back of the plane. Received lowest Group Boarding number because the gate agent said they order group number based on where you sit. Windows higher middle lower aisle lowest. But if you fly stand by you get to set in premium seats with better group number getting a better chance to have overhead space because no one wants to pay $84 just to sit closer to the front of the plane which gives you a better group number. Other airlines are based on more you pay more you get. Was already paying max for flight way more than rest because time constraints than other passengers. United does not care about their customers gate agents are mostly grumpy. They have some of the shortest leg room of most carriers.,1united-airlines,28/08/14,"MUC-EWR-MUC Aug 2014. Purchased very expensive summer tickets online at Lufthansa.com all the way being led to believe the flight was operated by LH. Only realized it was United after paying the ticket. 1) Pre-ordered special meal not available (although chosen when purchasing ticket at Lufthansa.com). 2) In order to select seats had to go to United.com after purchasing tix at Lufthansa.com. 3) In-flight entertainment had no sound on the MUC-EWR portion of journey. 4) Alcohol on board available only for cash? 5) Online boarding passes not available for either flight - never had this problem with Lufthansa Swiss or any other European airline! 6) EWR airport Terminal C is the worst ever seen nothing to do and bad food available only after the security checkpoint. 7) Check-in procedure at EWR: a huge and completely empty section of United check-in reserved for ""premium"" passengers (for all 12 of them). 8) Economy passengers check in a cellar at ""self-service"" terminals overseen by only a handful of employees slow inefficient overcrowded. If Lufthansa is serious about its Star Alliance ratings they should revise the membership of third-rate airlines.",1us-airways,06/04/15,I had a 4pm flight scheduled from Boston Phoenix last Thursday that never took off until 8 because they couldn't close the passenger door. We wasted money waiting around for our delayed flight and the only compensation we had was one free alcoholic drink on the way over. Then on our return flight they couldn't find my fathers information and would not let him on the flight. He had to pay an additional 500 dollars to board and now has to wait to be reimbursed. Mark my words I will never fly this airline again.,us-airways,06/04/15,Reasonable experience on recent flight from Philiadelphia to Miami. OneWorld Emerald member so used the lounge which was actually quite good. Flights on time aircraft clean and crew attentive - inflight meal ok. Cannot believe that US airways does not have inflight entertainment come on it's prehistoric! My other slight annoyance was that when I enquired if I could catch an earlier flight (checked in very early) I was told that would be $75 - my flight was full but the earlier one was less full...just appears to be cheap especially as my luggage caught the earlier flight (and I thought airlines tried to avoid unaccompanied luggage!).,6us-airways,04/04/15,Flight 503 March 29 2015. Traveling from FLL-PHX-Calgary. Flight attendants hid from view most of the trip(s) and tried to change seats online and was asked for a $78 fee. Nuts. Same seat area just a different and vacant position. Could not even sit with my spouse. Will never fly with this airline again.,united-airlines,20/08/14,"I fly 3-5 times a month domestically and internationally. My most recent flight was from Houston Texas to Mexico City. I must say that in 20 years of air travel I have never experienced a flight attendant crew as unprofessional as the crew on that plane. They were very short with passengers! The over head bins were full and they asked that stored our bags under the seats in front of us. I am 6' 2"" the new planes have even less room to fit your legs and feet. Once you bag goes there where are you to put your feet and legs? Keep in mind all I had was a computer bag. I was sitting mid plane in an aisle seat I asked if there was any room up further for my computer bag - ""No if you don't like it the next flight in 3 hrs is less full if you would like me to arrange it for you"". This was the reply in a very threatening tone! A few moments later I watched the same scenario happen to 2 more passengers with the same consequences. Very unprofessional atmosphere! This atmosphere and overall attitude seems to be becoming the normal for United. Flight #431 departed Houston 8.55am arrived Mex City at 11.10am.",3us-airways,04/04/15,No food for my children on flight from LA to Philly. Ran out before they got to us could have at least served the young kids first if they're not going carry enough for everyone.I'll drive to Newark or Baltimore before I fly US Airways again.,us-airways,29/03/15,I had 3 flights yesterday. 2 went down for mechanical issues causing the other to become over booked. I drive all the way back to Austin TX from San Antonio to catch the first flight and that's delayed. I told them to put me on the flight that's boarding now and I'm on a plane that's not moving cause of guess what mechanical issues! So much for me making my brothers wedding. Never again.,us-airways,24/03/15,Never again. My wife and I bought seats together for our round trip from Baltimore to Phoenix. Our seats were not honored both ways. Staff were not helpful. On the return trip the gate attendant was eating a sandwich while helping customers. Every single US Airways flight at the terminal was oversold. If it wasn't for volunteers we would have had to wait 8 hours for the next flight home. The plane was dirty and dusty. They don't even provide any free snacks. You had to pay $4 for a tiny bag of peanuts. Bottom line is if you want to sit with strangers possibly not make your flight overpay for snacks and sit on a dirty plane this is the airline for you.,2united-airlines,20/08/14,Another cancelled flight! I can't remember the last time a United flight took off on time. Unfortunately I live in Chicago and take them a lot. 2 cancellations in 2 months. They gave me a few points for the last cancelled flight. Big deal - I have to use them on United. United is so horrible that they actually tried to charge me for scheduling a flight in place of the flight they cancelled! Can we get trains to go Chicago to New York? Boston? It would be wonderful just like going from Amsterdam to Brussels to Paris. United has ruined travel. What a mess.,1united-airlines,18/08/14,I flew a 747 in first class from San Francisco to Seoul Korea. For a 13 hour flight I was expected to be tired when I reached my destination. However I was wrong. When I entered the aircraft I was immediately asked what beverage I would like as well as providing hot towels. The crew were very nice and gave us hand written Thank You notes for my business. The food was better than I expected it to be. They served so many appetizers before the main course that I was full. I was so surprised when they asked if I would like ice cream and customized it with toppings right in front of me! If you were hungry between meals there is a walk up bar that has fruits snacks wraps desserts etc. The IFE had a huge screen and had all the newest Hollywood blockbusters tv shows music and games. The seats were really comfortable as they had the option to put them 180 degrees so that you can sleep (the armrests automatically go down as the bed reclines) and can sleep comfortably for a tall person. They also had plenty of plugs that accepts USA and other countries plugs. The seats have plenty of storage however found it odd that flight attendants won't allow you to stow things under your seat. I slept right after the Meal service and was woken up just in time for breakfast. I couldn't believe that I could actually get sleep on a plane! It was a great experience flying United and would definitely fly with them again.,10us-airways,24/03/15,"It seems that US Airways doesn't realize that ""flight"" is not the entire customer experience. The experience begins well before the flight and ends well after the flight. We flew to SFO from PHX this week. We were issued boarding passes and noticed we were in Zone 5. Well since the seats are reserved that didn't seem to be a problem until during boarding a gate agent came to my wife and told her that they were checking her bag ""because there wasn't any bin space left"" and we could go to the carousel at SFO to pick it up. My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were ""confiscating"" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said ""no it's already gone."" I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a ""well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left."" On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant. Our bag was the last carry on allowed all the others were collected and checked. We realized at that point since there was plenty of bin space again that this is a ""convenience"" move by US Air their convenience they don't risk a late ""push back"" if people are seated faster. Of course ""their convenience"" translates into ""our inconvenience."" Why not board 5 minutes earlier? The plane was there all arriving passengers had been off for at least 30 minutes prior to our boarding. Moral of the story - my wife said ""I don't care how much more it is to fly Southwest we're never flying US Airways again.""",united-airlines,15/08/14,I only had two to three on-time flights from April to June out of more than 10 flights. My flight from Chicago to PVG got cancelled after sitting in the cabin for more than 3 hours in July. Yesterday my wife and son took same flight (UA835) and got delayed by 5.5 hours. UA staff on board were very rude. I will never fly United Airlines.,1us-airways,19/03/15,"I am extremely dissatisfied in US Airways customer service. Our flight to CLT from BOS was delayed due to not having a flight crew and CLT was not allowing any flights to land so we were assured that our connecting flight to MBJ would be made. When we finally got to CLT the flight attendant informed us that the flights were ""on time"" meaning their original time as we were in the air heading to CLT so we were not able to make our connecting flight. He was not able to give us any information (which is ridiculous) and we were promised that there would be US Airways staff at the gate. Of course this was a lie we had to wait in a 3 hour line told there were no other flights to our all inclusive resort told to get a hotel that the airline did not pay for we were in line for standby only once we got to the airport at 6 am. The kiosk assistant tried to split the 3 female travelers up heading to a foreign country after we had each paid 870$ to fly together and then found there were 3 seats on the next flight which demonstrates her incompetence. Our luggage was not available to us.",3us-airways,19/03/15,"Traveled from Omaha to Honolulu with 4 connecting flights total. We had a large family with 7 children. On each and every flight children were put in different rows from parents. We were able to switch with other passengers but with little help from staff. One of my daughters was traveling with an eight year old and a three year old. The children were placed in different rows and seats on a 7 hour flight and told there was ""nothing they could do."" Another daughter of mine had an infant and was twice placed in an exit row being told A) They cannot sit there B) You will have to find someone to switch with. (No fault of their own when they assigned the seats). My daughter was also told on our third flight that they could not gate check the baby's stroller. For what reason? No idea. We travel often and understand there are occasional mishaps. Unfortunately this pattern was consistent throughout our trip. We are hoping not to have to travel US or American again.",1united-airlines,15/08/14,"Gate agents are rude flights constantly delayed with no regard to connecting flights and mostly for ""crew availability."" Our most recent disaster was trying to get home to KC from San Antonio. First flight delayed putting us in Houston an hour after our connection was to leave. Had to call to find another flight since they offered no alternate options. Once in Houston the flight out was delayed twice due to ""awaiting aircraft"" a third delay due to ""crew availability"" and at 10pm was finally cancelled conveniently due to ""weather."" Which of course relieves United of any lodging responsibility even though the initial delay which caused this fiasco was fully their fault. Was traveling with my 11 year old son had no access to our luggage and ended up with a $361 airport hotel bill. They did finally do one thing right in the end that I have to give them credit for when they rebooked our cancelled flight for the next day they put us on Delta.",1us-airways,19/03/15,Took a flight with US Airways from JFK to Asheville with a change of plane in Charlotte. Our flight left JFK one hour late the Captain said he was waiting for paper work to be signed. We therefore missed our flight to Asheville the US Airways staff at Charlotte were very rude and could not care less. I had to beg to use a phone to call my cousin who was picking us up in Asheville to let her know what had happened. The agents at Charlotte said there were no seats left on any flights leaving for Asheville that day or the next I asked what should I do they said not our problem and shrugged their shoulders. I went to the desk and asked for a refund for the Charlotte to Asheville part of the trip and they cancelled my return flight as well.,us-airways,09/03/15,We recently travelled via US Airways to St. Lucia Virgin Islands. Our return flight home was routed through Charlotte N.C. Here we were scheduled for a 3 hour layover plenty of time to get through Customs and Immigration and re-check our baggage for our final destination. However the plane was one hour late in boarding in St. Lucia. Upon our arrival in Charlotte we were told there was no gate open for parking at the airport so we waited on the tarmac for a half hour or so. Then we were told there was no ground crew further delaying our de-planing. Once at the gate we were told that Customs was backed up and we were made to wait for another half hour on the plane. At this point we had 1 hour left to get through Customs and Immigration re-check our baggage and run to our gate actually only 45 minutes as the plane cannot be boarded for the last 15 minutes before take- off. My husband had TSA pre-check on his ticket however I did not. I had to go through a very long security line. My husband went to the gate to notify our plane that I was on my way - hurrying. Just as I finally ran to the gate (just at the 15 minute before flight mark) the flight attendants closed the door to the gate and would not allow me to board. I begged as there was still 15 minutes until take off they would not budge. We went to the ticket counter and were told that it was the last flight out and that there were no flights available the next day. So with no way to get home we rented a car drove all night and arrived back home 8 hours later without our baggage. We were met with rudeness and a complete lack of sympathy from customer service when dealing with the airline. By the way our flight from St. Lucia was to have meals available for purchase however by the time the attendants reach our seat in the 19th row there was no food left. We had not eaten all day.,2united-airlines,15/08/14,I had to fly for business to Springfield IL. United offered the best deal on this flight. We flew from Orlando to Chicago on an Airbus A320. Exit row very comfortable nice staff. Flight out of Chicago was delayed 3.5 hours but staff handled it well. After the delays we had a hydraulics issue and had to return to the gate. The flight attendant on board the CRJ-200 aircraft was phenomenal and helped us with anything we needed. She was very professional and great at helping us arrange things for arrival in Springfield. This was my first time flying United and even though the delays were outstanding staff were wonderful at handling it.,9united-airlines,15/08/14,I was flying CVG-ORD-LHR. Had an onward very good flight to Mumbai with Jet Airways. CVG-ORD flight was alright. Small aircraft not much of a problem as it was a short trip. It all started once we reached Chicago. After landing we waited in the aircraft for more than an hour. I reached my gate and asked the United staff about my plane. They clearly said that it was on time. So I go eat and come back and my flight is cancelled! I asked the same staff member again and she says I have to contact customer service. They tell me that there is another flight in 2 hours and they will transfer me. Told there are only middle seats in the middle row left! Th4 flight was delayed by an hour again and I was sure I would miss my connecting flight. Onboard the seat was very narrow no leg room and me being a vegetarian my special meal did not get transferred onto this flight. The staff were rude no smiles and hated being even asked for water. The entertainment was the worst I have seen! 4 channels 4 fixed movies one on each and they all start at the same time. Absolutely no value for money. As we finally after 8 hours land in London I had just 25 mins to go from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4 to catch my next flight so ran throughout no option and was one of the last people to catch the plane. I will never fly United again.,1us-airways,09/03/15,Seattle to Phoenix round trip. I was nervous about flying with US/American Airways after checking on this site there were so many poor reviews. When I got on the flights which weren't late or delayed by mechanical problems it was just like most other US domestic airlines I've flown on. The planes might have been a little old but they looked to be in about the same condition as a lot of other commercial carriers. Seats didn't seem to be any less comfortable leg room was average. Probably the biggest downside was that there was no inflight entertainment but they were only 2.5 hour flights so reading a book or playing a game was fine. The crews were nice not overly friendly and the pilots gave a few updates during the flight (both ways) which I always appreciate. I did notice that they didn't mention which baggage claim to go to at the end of either flight which would not be convenient for people that don't just do carry-ons. I'd say overall it's pretty comparable to most other airlines.,8us-airways,04/03/15,My experience was horrible. My flight coming home to PHL was canceled due to not enough crew members (as the email says). So then they tell me to do stand by for a few flights in Denver which I do. I was at the airport at 7am on a Sunday. All of the stand by fell through so they booked me a flight for 4.05pm to Charlotte n/c and then on to another plane to go to MDT Harrisburg. Everyone boards the plane at 4.20 and we just sit there didn't even move away from the door. Pilot comes over the loud speaker and says they are waiting for paperwork and that their computer system is down. The flight finally left at 6.35pm and arrived in Charlotte at 11.15. The flight ran out of food and only had chips left and when landed everything was closed in the airport so no dinner for me! Missed the connecting flight by almost an hour. So finally at 2am Monday morning I have a flight booked for 9.55am to go to a different airport because they couldn't get me to the other one until Tuesday! I wanted to change airlines but they said I could not get my checked bag back from them which was checked in Denver and at that time I made sure to get my bag switched to the new flight and they gave me a paper saying it was. They ran out of hotel rooms to give out and they said I can either pay for it myself of sleep at the airport. So I stayed at the airport. When I finally landed in Newark NJ my snowboard was not there and is at a different airport which I now have to wait to be shipped to me. If you want to not make any of your flights and waste a bunch of your time and money then I suggest using US Airways. I am now home at 3pm Monday when I was supposed to be home Sunday at 12pm.,united-airlines,15/08/14,"I was flying recently from Lincoln NE to Chicago IL. This flight goes back and forth between the two cities multiple times per day. The Lincoln airport also houses Delta and only has four gates so it is very small. The first flight left Lincoln and made it to Chicago with no problems. As the flight was coming back to Lincoln from Chicago it was diverted to Kansas City MO in which the staff members told us that it is too ""foggy"" to land in Lincoln. What was upsetting was that our flight was delayed three hours and there was not any fog in the area. In fact there was partial sunshine the day of our flight. The staff did not even apologize or attempt to assist the customers who had connecting flights in Chicago. Once on the aircraft the flight attendant was very rude and demeaning. For example we were at the back of the airplane and we did not even receive a beverage before we landed in which the flight attendant told us that we did not need one because she ran out of time.",1us-airways,04/03/15,"I was very much surprised and disappointed on my recent flight from Paris France to Philadelphia. I have never seen stewardesses act the way they did on this flight. I am an American yet most of the passengers were European. First off there was a language barrier. Some of the French passengers were sitting in the wrong seats. The stewardesses were telling the passenger to move. When they seemed confused these airline employees started to become very rude telling the passengers that because of them the flight was going to be late. I have never witnessed such disrespect on the employees part I decided to just remain in my seat and do as told not wanting to experience their wrath. No such luck My husband and I were dozing when they passed out ice cream. I couldn't find a spoon with the container. Not wanting to ""bother"" the stewardess I started to eat the ice cream using the lid as a spoon. The stewardess passed by and took the ice cream from my hands and took out the plastic spoon that was contained in the lid. I jokingly said ""sorry I couldn't find it"". Her abrupt response was ""you should have-they made an announcement where to find the spoon five minutes ago"" I could not believe my ears. I didn't even bother to tell her that I did not hear the announcement due to the fact that I was sleeping. I have traveled with many airlines and have never witnessed this behavior before.",4us-airways,04/03/15,Avoid at all costs. Monday my flight was canceled and given notice only minutes before I was going to leave. They then booked me on a flight the next day the last flight out of Cancun for the day. We had to purchase another night at our hotel at my own expense. Then I decided to go online and I found an earlier flight so I called the airlines and they put me on the earliest flight out of Cancun. My plane was second to take off on the tarmac when the pilot announced that a warning light was going on and that he needed it to be fixed. He proceeded to pull the airplane off of the active runway to get a hold of maintenance 20 minutes later announced that we had to return to the gate. But another plane was already at our gate so he pulled as close to the gate as possible so a bus was brought to the plane we got off on a bus and went back to the gate. Two hours later we got back on the bus and back on the plane. So now my flight was four hours late and of course I missed my connection in Philadelphia. When we got off the plane in Philadelphia they were very nice and they already booked my connection on a later flight to Milwaukee. Flight was supposed to leave at 8.30 but of course it did not leave at 8.30 because they did not have a crew for that particular flight. We finally took off at 11.10pm that night. No apologies from anyone all the crew said was we've had a long day too we were delayed for three hours so all of us are tired. Not what I really want to hear when I'm getting onto a flight. I have traveled all around the world on numerous flights and occasionally I have encountered weather delays or minor maintenance problems so I'm used to that but never ever have I experienced three flights all with issues unbelievable. I will never fly them again.,united-airlines,15/08/14,My husband myself and 3 year old was supposed to fly out the 12th of Aug at 6.10pm. Our flight was delayed 3 times. Then we were told now we had to stay the night at Richmond airport or at O'Hare. We had a choice. We decided to just go home and come back to the 7.45am flight. We got the airport at 6am and was told our flight was delayed until 9am but our connecting flight took off at 9am. So at this point we had no flight out of O'Hare. The airline told us we could sleep at O'Hare on the floor for 7 hrs and couldn't promise a flight out. We did change to American Airlines but did have to wait 5 hrs for that flight. We slept on an airport floor until we left. But no issues after we got off of United.,1united-airlines,15/08/14,"Flew from Dulles to Brussels on what was described by crew as ""a better option than Dulles to Newark to Brussels"" and then were left in Belgium with no baggage and no attempt of help from United. We ended up going to Morocco from there and were helped by both Air Maroc and the Belgians. On the way back to the U.S. we were then bumped from our flight due to United giving away our pre-booked tickets to another family. They then complained to us that we were late when we were in fact 3 hours early.",1us-airways,04/03/15,"US Air has become a disaster zone. First they switched our aircraft and seat assignments without any notification giving us poorer locations. Then no online check-in was available in either direction resulting in chaos at the terminals. The self-service kiosks for one airline wouldn't accommodate the other. (American doesn't recognize US Air confirmation codes and vice versa). Our outbound flight was delayed by an hour to load late cargo. (Why should cargo be given priority? The plane wouldn't have waited if we'd been stuck in a traffic jam or overslept). Onboard the premium economy seats were hardly bigger than standard seats. The earphones at $5 were defective and the jacks in the seats had poor connections. Food options were a joke and the new credit card system does not provide a receipt. Customers were told to go online if they wanted one. Really? All the same check-in problems occurred on the return flight. Then we had to move to a different gate because the plane was (guess what?) delayed. Cargo perhaps. No restrooms on the same level as this new gate and no other services. Then all the same problems with inflight food and entertainment. On landing the crew forgot to ask passengers to fasten seat belts put tray tables/seats in their full and upright position etc. No one came through the aisles checking. And at no time during the flight did the captain or ""flight deck"" welcome passengers or comment on anything. We suspect this is all the result of unhappy people working in an unhappy environment.

For the second time I missed my connecting flight in CLT to GSO because US Airways was delayed by two hours from my origin in Orlando. No explanation given but I am 100% sure weather had nothing to do with it as all was clear in Charlotte and Greensboro. The remaining three flights that evening were all overbooked. This is what happened before and I ended up waiting around trying to get on a flight all night only to be shuttled to a hotel to spend the night and hopefully get a flight the next morning. I wasn't going to do that again as GSO is only a 1.5 hour drive so I rented a car and drove home. Were they willing to reimburse my rental? Of course not instead they offered a voucher. Terrible customer relations.,united-airlines,15/08/14,Horrible experience on a Tuesday night flight United flight delays because of some rain from Charleston WV to Chicago caused me to miss flight to Memphis. United only rebooked flight the next day. No offer to put up in hotel. Had to stay in the airport and just sit for 9 hours waiting on the next flight (which got delayed too). It took over 19 hours to go from Charleston to Memphis. I should have taken a Greyhound bus it would have been much cheaper and faster. Horrible service they simply don't care. Never will fly United again.,1us-airways,24/02/15,Feb 17 flight 646 from PDX to PHX. On the same day I took flight 489 from PHX to PIT. I decided to fly US Airways PDX to PIT in February as the connection was in PHX and I was pretty sure PHX wouldn't have weather-related delays. I regretted buying my ticket after I started reading reviews about US Airways. And I was expecting the worst when I flew a couple of days ago. To my surprise it was actually really good. Both flights were early both planes had clearly been updated and were clean and comfortable. The flight attendants were attentive friendly and helpful. On the first flight which left PDX at 5.20 am the FA was careful to not wake people up while also serving those who were awake. When people woke up later and asked for things the FA served them breakfast and drinks with a smile. Breakfast was great - steel cut oats with fresh fruit dried fruit nuts (I don't like eating a huge eggy breakfast early (which was also offered) in the morning and appreciated this healthy choice). The two things that were disappointing about the trip was t he lack of space in first class on the 319 and the lack of entertainment system on a longer flight (4 hours). With regard to the seat when the person in front of me reclined I couldn't use my table and the seat was less than a foot from my face. I had to ask the passenger to move her seat which she was gracious about. But I thought that it was less space in first class than I get on some airlines in coach.,10united-airlines,15/08/14,"My husband and I went to Cozumel from Dallas and back with United. The night before out flight I tried to check in and on one of our flights the only way to get to claim seats was by paying 40$ per person. Ridiculous as I had booked the flight months ago. Departing there was a 40 min delay due to ""lack of personnel"" but as we were boarding the pilot came on saying there was no reason for the delays and that the crew were all there. On the way home the same issue of not being able to claim seats without paying. Then on the way home we had a delay once again from Houston to Dallas. The first delay was due to ""awaiting aircraft"" and it was 50 min then we boarded the plane 15 mins late due to delayed customers then a final delay of 45 min due to operations. Absolutely ridiculous especially as I paid 100 dollars more for an earlier flight.",1united-airlines,15/08/14,Flying on this United Express service Embraer RJ 135 from Houston to Nashville was a very claustrophobic experience. Being 190cm when I walked in I had to seriously bend over for the ceiling is very low. The 2-1 seating configuration is a good indicator of how small and narrow the cabin really is.

First impression at OMG in the morning in Orlando I went to the First Class check-in for my International flight. Instead of being helped I was told to use a machine which frankly was confusing and when I asked for help I got an agent rolling her eyes and loudly expelling air. Really? Off to the gate and onto a 757 in the Intl config. Seat was decent crew was experienced and the gentleman working first knew his craft well. Came to take drink orders for me and the person next to me set the ""snack basket"" between us. Changed to a PSA operated CRJ900. Brand new with the new plane smell. Nice for what it is and in the inflight service was ok. Return from IAD to CLT in a CRJ900 operated by Mesa. The plane was a train wreck and smelled like urine. The FA's served F class to death but no one in coach even got a glance. US Air lounge in CLT lots of dark wood and Fox Noise on the TV's. Last leg to MCO on one of the last 767-200's.

Add to that the comfy seats and the experience is quite OK. This 3+ hour flight from San Francisco to Houston had a much improved service - the United staff finally seem to be having some fun and are proud again of their airline. It shows. Besides the service the meals have also improved. There are more healthy choices such as a salad with grilled chicken and fresh toppings chicken wrap and the likes. And then there are those sumptuous warm chocolate cookies that they serve at the end. This flight had not IFE so I resorted to using my iPad and paid for the very inexpensive inflight wifi service. I was shocked how great the wifi onboard worked and for only $2/hour. This is a game changer.,9us-airways,12/02/15,"I was stranded overnight in Phoenix on superbowl weekend.

I received a standby ticket for the next day and there is no guarantee I will get on as the superbowl passengers are leaving tomorrow as well. Poor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on my part. No voucher were issued since they claimed they could not control the weather. There are absolutely no hotel rooms here and absolutely no flights out of here at all for apparently several days.

The last time we boarded the plane when it was time to push back from the gate there's a maintenance issue. The markers that align to show the cabin door has been properly closed were not aligning. We were asked to return to the terminal and wait for the off site maintenance to come check it out. Forty minutes later we were allowed to board again and were able to successfully take off.

Therefore whenever I travel I almost only fly Delta or US Airways. Most recently I flew from CLT to CUN. Although the 757-200 had winglets and the fancy new AA paint job that could not make up for the dissatisfaction I experienced during flight. My seat was very uncomfortable and the cabin was very very dated. There was NO in flight entertainment (not even from the clunky overhead screen). The staff were decent but nothing spectacular. On the way back I flew on an A321 but it felt similar to the 757 I had flown on to CUN. I have flown on every type of plane in the fleet and every plane has this sort of feeling with the exception of the A330 (note: the A330 fleet still feels average when compared to other airlines but is better than every other plane in their fleet. The 767-200s in their fleet are horrible and the A320 family in their fleet is relatively shabby. Regional jets are what you would expect from a regional jet. Overall a horrible airline and as soon as I move out of Asheville to a larger city I plan on using another airline.,us-airways,06/02/15,"Flew to Manchester UK. First leg (delayed). Second leg (PHI to MAN UK) we all get on the plane after slight delay and the pilot comes on and says ""We have to replace to doors on the front undercarriage - we'll be here about 15 minutes"". For the next hour we hear every 15 minutes that we will be on the ground for another 15 minutes. Finally we head for the de-icing stand. The pilot tells us that the plane had been standing at the airport all day and it would take extra time to de-ice. If the plane had been there all day why hadn't they taken care of the maintenance and got the plan de-iced before the scheduled departure time? Rest of flight is routine until we get to Manchester when they can't seem to get the jetway to roll up to the door. Come on people how hard can it be? So we have to wait for them to find some steps and we deplane onto the tarmac. Glad it wasn't bucketing with rain. On way back they book us onto a cancelled flight and don't tell us our connection is cancelled until we get to Philadelphia. What's more they think everything is cancelled for Tuesday too and they don't care! Customer service reps weren't even apologetic and certainly weren't interested in helping us get home. So we run over to the departures board and find jetBlue still has flights and we manage to get on a jetBlue flight. Re: Food. They served dinner at 11 O'clock at night - really? All you want them to do at that time is turn the lights down so you can try to sleep. Didn't eat it but it left the cabin smelling like a Russian cafeteria Then they served a pathetic breakfast just before landing when a decent breakfast would have been welcome. Totally ill-conceived. Re: Cabin crew: Perfectly acceptable. Did have an odd situation where the crew member asked me what I wanted to drink and then disappeared without a word (or a drink) and I had to ask again when they went by later but they brought me my drink quickly after that. It was the service desk that causes me to rate Staff Service as poor. Re: Entertainment.

From Calgary to Orlando two flights and no snacks provided. My kids were so upset not having any entertainment. TV did not show any channels unless you pay with your credit card. Snacks only if you pay. Missed a connecting flight and delayed due to weather. Waited in line for 3 hours and then boarded. Still no complimentary snacks provided to passengers. No taxi voucher provided due to missed flight. I had to pay more than $200 USD to taxi and I stayed in hotel for only 5 hours. Cost me more time and money to stay for those 5 hours. When I went to board the flight I was told only 2 members of my family could board they did not have space for all four.

I will make sure no one in my family fly with this airline.,1united-airlines,15/08/14,"The second time United Airline had failed me. The first was on October 2013. This review is about my last flight in August 14. I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn't work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn't find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn't tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said ""Obviously it's right there can't you see it?"". I told her their screens are broken so no I can't see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

Yes this was after I informed then it was due to an old line-of-duty injury they didn't care. 2) Refused to waive a $450 difference for a flight two hours before the flight I was booked on even though the requested change is because of an impending snow storm starting when the flight I'm booked on is leaving. 3) Charged bag fees to Cancun Mexico even though it is an international flight and they don't charge fees for every other Mexican city they fly to.,us-airways,19/01/15,We flew from Brussels to Philadelphia. Before we even took off the pilot announced we might have to stop to refuel which would delay our flight by an hour. That being said the plane was miserably small and old. The air conditioners were so loud it was difficult to hear announcements or talk to flight attendants. We had to stop in NY for fuel which delayed our flight by an hour and a half. We landed in Philadelphia at 3.10. At least 20 passengers missed their connecting flights in Philadelphia including ourselves. We were supposed to have a connecting flight to Nashville at 3.45. When we deplaned they already had new tickets printed for passengers who would be missing their next flight which was nice. The new plan was to leave for Charlotte at 5 and then catch a connecting flight to Nashville. It took them an hour to retrieve our luggage from the plane and another 20 minutes for us to get through customs and security. We rechecked out bags but they didn't ask us for any additional information just took our bags and said we were fine. The gate number for Charlotte on the ticket they had just printed was wrong so we almost missed that flight but made it just in time. We got to Charlotte and boarded for Nashville without any glitches. When we boarded for Nashville we sat in the plane for 30 minutes after our take off time. No one said why. We finally got to Nashville and our luggage had not made it with us. They said it was still in Charlotte. They are supposed to be delivering it some time today.

We experienced the worst service ever. Delayed flights once they told us that the wrong plane had been sent. How do you send the wrong plane. 100 people too small. Miserable gum chewing flight attendants that looked like they'd just crawled out of bed. Nearly bumped off one flight altogether and the staff couldn't care less.

I have taken many business class flights on other airlines so I have a sense of what should happen. When arriving the attendant did not greet us. She just threw the menu our way and said to give her our dinner order. They served me my on board champagne but forgot to serve my partner. When we inquired the attendant said to wait a minute as he was doing a 'head count'. Partner ordered the steak but was given the fish instead. They apologized and said to wait 20 minutes for the steak. When it finally arrived it was blood red and inedible. If you ask me they do not have enough help on board. With 32 seats in business I saw only 2 attendants. Etihad and Thai Airways have double that for the same number of people. The new business class seats are made for men. It is not possible to put your foot on the foot rest without adjusting the seat back. This airline needs to step it up.

After the mixed reviews for this airline I accompanied by nine other family members was not looking forward to this flight. Almost a two-hour delay taking off caused by understaffed flight control employees on vacation and a one hour delay landing because of bad weather in Boston tested our grandkids' endurance. But US Airways made the experience on both legs as pleasant as possible. The captain kept us very well-informed and the flight attendants were cheerful and very present. The seats were more comfortable than in many economy cabins I have experienced. Further given the large number of families with young children boarding US Airways was able to start the board process early. Agents at both the check in counter and the gate were exceptionally helpful and friendly. And finally luggage arrived promptly at both destinations. An excellent experience.,10united-airlines,08/08/14,"We sent our son 11 years old from San Francisco to Austin TX for a trip on his own. When we were booking his flight on united.com it said that there was a mandatory $300 airline service fee for unaccompanied minors if a child is under 12. The $300 was supposed to pay for a mandatory ""unaccompanied minor service"". According to them the fee will give the child a United representative to be of help at all times. When we got to the airport though we learned that the ""service"" was a scam and that they weren't going to do anything for my son. We thought they were going to help him through security and onto the gate but no. They told us that we could have gate passes and go through the security line and help him onto his flight. We were expecting them to help my son for anything he needed but it seemed that they were treating him like he was an adult and didn't care that he was going on a flight all by himself. Today he is supposed to come back from Austin but his flight is delayed due to technical difficulties for 5 hours and instead of taking care of my son as I have paid them to do so I they instead have called my son's aunt whom my son was living with in Austin and asked her to come and wait with my son for the duration of the time. We are wondering why we have paid this fee and what it even includes. When his aunt went to tell the the airline service that my son has the unaccompanied minor service they told her that they don't care and that she must wait in the line like everyone else. This is horrible service and is terrible compared to other airlines. I will not be flying with United Airlines after this experience.",1united-airlines,08/08/14,"We flew home from Germany to Alberta Canada we had a stop over in Chicago IL. United Airlines had the worst service we have ever had from an airline company. The people were very unhelpful. Here is what happened an explanation of why we are so disappointed. The customer service was the worst we have had. It was our honeymoon we boarded our initial flight in Barcelona Spain with a different airline they flew us to Germany at which point we were to get on our UA flight. The first thing that annoyed us was that the UA airline baggage people didn't even make an effort to get our luggage on our first UA flight (this is something we didn't find out until we were already in Chicago). The lady we spoke to in Chicago simply said ""you had a short layover and in cases like that we don't get the luggage because its too difficult."" Once we were in Chicago and realized our baggage hadn't made it onto our plane we were told that it would be very easy to give the UA baggage office our address and they would ship them to us the next day. So we landed in Calgary (an hour late) and went to the UA baggage office to report our missing bags and give our address to them. We waited at their office for 1.5 hrs. This was a very frustrating experience in regards to the baggage and customer service. On a final note I would not recommend traveling with United Airlines (Lufthansa)!",1us-airways,14/01/15,"I was recently reminded why I avoid US Air after a flight to LGA on Christmas Eve. The flights attendants offered no cabin service because of ""Turbulence."" My desk is more turbulent than that flight. They just refused to work. Maybe if they'd remained strapped in. It wasn't so turbulent that they couldn't walk around in the galley area. At least I booked on Delta for the return.",us-airways,11/01/15,"I have always selected US Airways as my airline of choice. That will no longer be the case as of this last trip. I am completely unsatisfied with the way in which US Airways customer service dealt with a series of unfortunate events. I purchased 2 direct First Class flights from Washington DC to Phoenix AZ. Not only was the first flight cancelled due to maintenance we were then re-routed through Des Moines Iowa only to have our second connecting flight to Phoenix cancelled. Over twenty hours later we finally reached our destination. We lost a day of our vacation. I phoned US Airways customer care and thought that they would understand the following - 1) We purchased Direct First Class seats which are more expensive then multiple stop shuttle flights as well as foregoing the lunch even that should have been offered. 2) Cancellations were not due to weather rather maintenance (on two planes)- we lost a day of an already short trip to see family. I requested a change in the RT flights home by 1 day (same flight # etc) to allow our family to make up the time lost. I was told and I quote ""We got you there and that is all we commit to. Given you are requesting a flight change of your choice and not due to the airline there is nothing we can do for you."" The total cost to make the change is $600.00 per person. I was disgusted at the lack of care regarding the situation and further their lack of concern. I would not recommend travelling on this airline.",united-airlines,08/08/14,United Airlines business or first class to Aruba is very bad. Misleading advertising service and claimed equipment is false. No inflight entertainment as advertised. No video or music in First Class. Seats tray and pockets all dirty with food and garbage from last passenger. This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it. All bait and switch. This was a blatant rip-off of a consumer. Make you pay for services and then you don't get them.,1united-airlines,08/08/14,"I flew 3 times with UA during our July 2014 vacations: a round trip Houston-Managua and Houston-Munich. 1) Houston-Managua-Houston: a 3 hour trip and neither a packet of peanuts nor a coke to offer. All was chargeable but water. Never experienced it before with a major airline. 2) Houston-Munich: Firstly our initial flight was cancelled after a 4 hours wait. Ground staff overwhelmed. We waited 2 hours more for rebooking on next day flight they lodged us for overnight in a poor hotel. When finally we took the next days flight crew on board were unpleasant neither a smile nor a ""thank you"" especially for the offloaded passenger of the previous day. Lunch and breakfast were unacceptable except for pets. Frankly I'm not a demanding guy nor a pain but I will never take this airline anymore.",1us-airways,11/01/15,I have flown with US airways 3 times now and each time has been unpleasant. I wonder if this airline is ever on time. All flights were delayed - once for 12 hours. This time I flew to Puerto Vallarta from San Francisco. The flight to SF was delayed and I had to run with my carry on and barely made my connecting flight. On the way back the check-in service at Puerto Vallarta airport was appalling. I first was directed to a long line to get my boarding pass from a computer and then I had to wait in another line for the US airways staff to look at my visa. Had to board a bus to get to the waiting plane. I booked my ticket / seats well in advance and was not given the seats I had selected - I was seated in the middle over the wing on all flights - the one seat I did not want. When I complained I was told it was my fault for checking in late - I was early and had chosen my seat when I purchased the tickets. I was also told that I did not have the right status to guarantee my seat. On the flight from Phoenix to San Francisco also delayed it was difficult to even get a cup of water. All together a horrible experience. I will be paying the extra dollars for the non-stop service with Alaska Airlines next time.,us-airways,11/01/15,I just returned from a family trip to Puerto Vallarta where we all flew US Air! This is the worst airline experience I have experienced. The employees seem to all be rude and unprofessional. It's a real shame since it flies to many destinations I fly to but I will pay more to have an airline that actually values its customers. Every leg of each of our flights were delayed one of our parties missed their flight even though the plane was still at the gate. It set on at the gate for 10 minutes before it pushed away. There were 21 people that needed to be rebooked standing! Same thing happened on the way back! Southwest and Alaska never treats passengers with such disregard.,united-airlines,08/08/14,After taking a red-eye from San Francisco I was bumped from my flight. It happens the planes were switched but the very blatant tension selection of those who got left behind was very frustrating. The customers left behind had booked their flight well in advance and there seemed to be a consistent trait we were connectors from SF. The question of whether I was in for an adventure aka a delayed flight to a completely different location was condescending. No apology until I dealt with a woman at the end of the process. She treated the situation with sensitivity and realized that as a traveler and customer this could possibly be stressful and frustrating. As their customer it seemed like my Sunday was worth less than everyone on the plane. Perhaps they should under board planes not over board them to make more money.,1united-airlines,08/08/14,"I have had several problems with UA over the years and tend to avoid them but recently I had no good option other than to travel with them from SFO to Dulles round-trip in economy class. The return flight on a 757-300 was horrific with turbulence for hours. The pilot never really commented on it other than a brief ""It's bumpy so I've turned on the seat belt sign"". I am only 5' 2"" and 105 lbs. and I was unable to sit without my knees hitting the seat in front of me. There was no in-flight entertainment at all. I will continue to avoid flying UA at all costs even though they have a hub near us in SFO. My past grievance with them concerned their small seats rude flight staff and last-minute flight cancellations back-to-back with other overbooked flights. While turbulence is turbulence it was handled very poorly.",2us-airways,11/01/15,Recently flew from Philadelphia to Orlando and return. Philadelphia curbside checking smooth - no issues. Pre- printed boarding so just straight to security. Airside boarding was crowded and pretty disorganized. Flight uneventful but crowded. Lots of families with excited kids but to be expected. Arrival fine. Return less crowded. No issues. Plane both ways pretty worn. FA's did job just not very friendly.,5us-airways,31/12/14,We travelled for the first time with this airline and happy to say we were well pleased with all 4 of our flights. We left Manchester 8th Dec via Philadelphia and on to Miami landing 30 mins early. We experienced no hitches whatsoever and also with our return journey on Dec 18th. Seats were fine and food was very acceptable. No problems and we would be happy to use this airline again.,10united-airlines,08/08/14,Flight from Cancun to Houston 8/5/14 arrived at the airport 2.5 hrs prior's to flight time of 3.02pm. It took the entire 2.5 hours to get through the check in line. Ended up having to run to catch the plane. Don't know why they didn't open more lanes the line never got any shorter. When we finally got to the front the line was just as long if not longer than we got there 2.5 hours earlier. Stewardess's were not friendly. Only good thing was flight was on time.,3united-airlines,08/08/14,The in-flight service and cabin cleanliness was terrible. I have flown this flight before it has been fine. This time around the flight staff were rude or off-handish. One flight attendant abruptly placed the food tray stating 'only chicken' when another flight attendant actually had pasta. When questioned we were spoken to rudely. The toilets were not cleaned on other airlines they clean as you go. My wife mentioned to the flight attendants and their reply was 'you should see the rest of China' - we actually live in Beijing. They also said that she should wait until Beijing when it will be cleaned. Also in years past (18 years I have been flying with UAL) United had been much better. Flight attendants didn't know when to turn lights on or off or when they were suppose to start the food/beverage services. Where has the United I once knew gone?,5united-airlines,08/08/14,"I have flown with United Airlines multiple times so this is no ""one time"" incident. To have a something go wrong is almost unavoidable. My last experience for example was the last flight of a series of flights from Prague to New Orleans if only it were that easy. The final flight from Washington to New Orleans was supposed to leave at 6:50. There was a ""late inbound aircraft arrival"" which kept us all in the airport for 3 hours constantly being reassured that the flight would be there shortly. I wish I could say that this incident was the only time it has happened but unfortunately this is a feeling quite familiar to a United Aircraft flyer.",1us-airways,22/12/14,I am disabled and have a great deal of difficulty walking unassisted - cannot bend my knees very far. I flew US Air not realizing how terrible they are. They waited until everyone was boarded before wheeling me to the plane. Since I have difficulty walking all eyes were on me as I very slowly walked to my seat holding onto the headrests of each seat. I had to make one connection with each flight in Charlotte NC. The reservation associate was able to place me on an aisle all but one way and told me when I got to Charlotte that staff at the gate would change me with another passenger. After everyone else had boarded a very rude gate attendant told me the plane was fully booked and they couldn't change my seat which was half way back in the middle seat. A sweet young lady on the aisle offered to change with me so at least I was able to accomplish that. I cannot carry any weight other than a handbag I asked the male flight attendant to carry my carryon to my seat and place it in the overhead for me he begrudging did it turned around in a huff and walked away afterwards. Staff were all rude. I will never fly this airline again. No food was offered on a flight that was almost 2 hours long. I also experienced a delay almost missing my connecting flight.,us-airways,18/12/14,Orlando to Tucson with stop in PHX. Flight attendants were rude. Flight to Tucson - no beverage service. Staff stated flight was too short - I have flown this route many times and have never seen any airline not even offer water.,united-airlines,08/08/14,July 23rd GRR-ORD-LAX-LAS and on July 29th LAS-DEN-GRR. The staff at United were so friendly and helpful! The flights were easy quick and problem free. Even with an hour delay between connections we made it into our destination on time! We needed to change our seats so we could sit together and the attendants at both gates were quick and friendly about helping us!,10united-airlines,08/08/14,8am flight from Winnipeg to Chicago cancelled 12 hours early due to weather. How the airline knew there would be weather issues that far in advance is beyond me. The earlier flight and the later flight taking the same route went as scheduled. Was re-booked unknown to me with an overnight in Denver (final destination was Tampa). After much difficulty finding a number for the airline was able to get a different flight however leaving Aug 6th instead of 5th. Then asked to be refunded the checked baggage fee and was told I have to do that myself online. Checked the weather this morning and the skies between Winnipeg and Chicago all clear. Will stay clear of United from now on.,1us-airways,18/12/14,US799 AMS to PHL. Take this flight often unfortunately due to no other direct flights between these 2 locations. Firstly ground staff at PHL check in are just unfriendly. Surly and not one smile. The aircraft's they use on this leg often breaks down and the interior is extremely outdated. You get to watch a movie on an overhead screen zero selection. It's like flying on something from 20 years ago. What could make up for this is the cabin crew but unfortunately they too are surly and clearly lost all sense of customer service after many years on the job.,us-airways,10/12/14,Flight 730 CLT-LHR economy. Boarded surprisingly early. Not full flight. Almost 1 hr delay at the gate after boarding due to mechanical issue but strong tail winds made up for most of it. Water was offered during the delay. Dinner was choice of chicken with risotto or pasta with Alfredo sauce plus soft cheese and crackers roll and butter garden salad and dressing and a dessert bar. The entrÃ©e is just the same as a microwave meal so if you like that you will like the food onboard. If you don't you won't. I did. Was pleasantly surprised by two changes since my last trip on this flight less than a month earlier - beer is now complimentary in economy. Previously only the house red / white wine was complimentary. Also the pre-arrival snack is more extensive. Before it was a hot muffin. Now it's the same hot muffin with a couple other bagged treats. CLT is nice for frequent flyers. Security Checkpoint C is kept for the elite levels so not much wait there. Also the preferred access lets you bypass the line of people waiting to board and go right to the front and be the next one on the plane.,9united-airlines,08/08/14,United has become a terrible airline since the merger with Continental. The service customer focus and experience have all declined in the past few years. United no longer values loyal customers and it is evident by their service and how they treat their loyal members. I have been a loyal member for 20 years and have decided it is time to find another airline who will treat their passengers better and create a better flight and service experience. The delays also have been horrendous lately with waiting for flight crews to arrive.,3united-airlines,08/08/14,Flew Houston-Denver in Economy Plus. UAL charges you extra for deplorable seats. So narrow that the normal sized guy next to me was half in my seat. And the so called extra leg room is a scant 3 inches more for $50. The guy in front reclined his seat all the way ans I thought I was in a tiny cage. UAL charges for AV service. The snack pack for $8 was just OK. The flight staff was friendly - the only positive about this airline.,3us-airways,10/12/14,CDGâ€“PHL NOV 30 2014. CDG AA Lounge is over crowded. Only 3 men's lavatories for more than 100 people. Preflight drink in plastic glass. Pre-lunch drink with cold poor quality nuts appetizer salad similar to those available in a low-cost market. Entree and cheese were OK. Crew too busy to speak in the galley. No question for more bread wine or coffee. Seat is flat and ok so is IFE. Snack before lunch was a joke - a cheap pizza and a salad. Lavatories beetwen Business and Economy locked all the flight. No reason as to why!,us-airways,10/12/14,I flew from Fort Lauderdale to Philadelphia and on to Ottawa on 24 Nov. I cannot say that this was a good travel experience. My first impression on arrival at the Fort Lauderdale check-in in counter was a dismal fail. Even though there were hardly any people in line I was ignored standing first in the wrong line then once directed to another line was ignored by the agent there until finally another approached and proceeded to get my baggage tag. The flights themselves were fairly uneventful and the inflight staff were much more friendly. The seating was however not comfortable nor was there any kind of seatback entertainment system like on other airlines. The flight from Philadelphia to Ottawa was a quick regional jet flight and therefore I am used to no on board amenities. This flight was not horrible but the poor reception at Fort Lauderdale did leave me feeling like I might not choose US Airways for my next transborder flight.,5united-airlines,08/08/14,YWG-ORD BUF-ORD. My flight was supposed to be at 6am but they had us waiting for 2 hours before they cancelled it they rebooked me on a flight that was 11 hours later. On the same trip going back from Buffalo the flight was 3 hours late worst flight experience ever. I know flying United is sometimes cheaper but its not even worth it.,2united-airlines,08/08/14,I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late. I lost time money and sleep. United had no compassion and was unapologetic.,1us-airways,10/12/14,I was using a duffle sized soft bag as my carry on and the US Airways check-in assistant told me it was too big and I had to check it. I told her I had flown the previous day with US Airways and many other times using this same bag and it had never been a problem. Extremely dismissive - looked at my ticket and told me that I wasn't a preferred member. We put the bag on the frame and it fit. Told that it didn't matter and I had to check the bag. I checked the measurements of the bag online and it is compliant with airline requirements for carry on luggage. I am furious that status with an airline and one person's opinion impacts my service. I will be giving my business and money to other airlines.,1us-airways,04/12/14,"YYZ-PHL-PUJ. Toronto has a horrible border preclearance. Whole passage (customs passport control baggage and security) took about 35-45 mins. The terminal on the other hand is clean and well maintained. The US Airways staff offered to put large carry-ons in the hold for free. The flight was uneventful staff indifferent. Connection in PHL well done. Terminal A looks amazing. Terminals B-E were very small and crowded. The flight from PHL to PUJ I was amazed that US Airways decided to use a twin-aisle A330. The crew was funny cheerful and helpful. The seats were reasonably clean and well spaced seatback IFE with quite the selection of games and videos/songs. The customs in PUJ were straightforward with a new 10 dollar entry tax for ""tourist cards"". Overall worth the money and definitely would fly again.",4united-airlines,08/08/14,Completely disorganized unfriendly and the least bit helpful. The customer service from the second I came into the airport in Toronto were so unwelcoming. After printing out my boarding passes at the kiosk with no help (Sunwing kiosks had assistants walking around assisting people) struggled with a kiosk and then headed to the line to check bags in. The girl at the desk just seemed so unimpressed and was very cold towards my family and I. Upon going through customs it was very disorganized and very little help was offered while at the receipt kiosks. While going through baggage check the man checking our carry ons was telling everyone that passed that our flight was cancelled. Mind you the smartphone app said the flight was on time early actually. We then got into the waiting area there was just a sense of panic going on and nobody knew what was going on. A flight attendant came and confirmed it was cancelled. Maybe 10 minutes went by and another flight attendant came by and said it was in fact running on time and not to worry. All in all very disorganized and unwelcoming. I've always flown with Sunwing and I guess next time I won't be travelling with United.,1united-airlines,08/08/14,Flight from Detroit to New York was 3 hours late which meant we arrived so late that there was nothing left of the day despite only a 1 hr 50 min flight. On the flight from NY to Stockholm we never experienced such unprofessional and unpleasant behaviour from the cabin crew. Overall grumpy except one younger female flight attendant. The older female was very harsh and unfriendly. We will never fly United Airlines again.,2us-airways,01/12/14,I recently flew with American Airlines from Philadelphia to Dublin on the red eye. The flight was well organised but the facilities were extremely poor. The inflight entertainment consisted of 1 screen for the cabin I was at the bulkhead so couldn't even see the film. Only one film was played for the entire 6 hours of the flight. The food was comical and breakfast I actually took with me to show my friends in the pub it consisted of a flat muffin which looked like a normal muffin had been stepped on.,6us-airways,20/11/14,Three hour flight delay due to mechanical issues. One being lack of AC. Confined to the airplane the entire time. One issue after another kept us grounded. Offered nothing but water. We sat at the gate the entire time looking inside the terminal at 2 fast food restaurants. We should have been allowed to deplane with instructions to stay in the immediate area. Once in the air we had to pay for food (snacks).,united-airlines,08/08/14,"HNL/LAX: The return flight from Honolulu to LAX was cancelled. Even though UA had our contact information we were never notified that our flight had been cancelled. It wasn't until we went online to do our check-in that we found out about the cancelled flight. The first reservationist we spoke to was not very helpful. She had us booked to return home the next day in economy and not first class as was paid for stating this was all that was available. We weren't satisfied with her ""solution"" so we called UA back and spoke with another reservationist who was more helpful. Not only did she offer us another first class flight but it was also on the same day as originally planned (not the next day). Dealing with the first reservationist was very frustrating.",7united-airlines,08/08/14,MEL-SYD-LAX-IAH-GIG. Paid an economy ticket and was upgraded on all flights to Business using one global credit. Service out of Melbourne was superb - attentive crew and a light load. Out of Sydney the flight was full but again the crew were attentive and service was fairly good. The flight LAX/IAH was particularly good - the crew were amazing. The last flight IAH-GIG was superior - the 772 was much newer than the one used on the SYD-LAX route and crew did not disappear for hours in the middle of the flight. The dinners were good but the breakfasts average. Considering the price paid for the ticket I was pleasantly impressed. All flights left on time and arrived on schedule or ahead of schedule. After 39 hours of travel time I was left feeling not too bad!,9us-airways,17/11/14,I was rebooked on US Airways after a United flight was delayed. Then the US Airways flight was delayed and we had to disembark. I had to rebook my trip because my onward US flight to Tel Aviv would have left. The customer service agent said I did not pay for the ticket and wondered several times why I was allowed to board. She called her supervisor who discovered I had paid (business class) and that is why I was on their flight. I received no apology but lots of attitude. So no more US Airways.,us-airways,12/11/14,US 731 Business Class LHR to CLT A330-300 24th October 2014 very good seat 1A great service and good food.,10united-airlines,03/08/14,"HNL-ORD.

My seat worked ok but my wife had to manually lift the leg support on hers and couldn't unhinge the foot rest. Then in addition the reading light for her seat wouldn't turn off. On-board staff were great: sincerely apologetic for the lack of amenities profusely sympathetic about the seat problems. Service was excellent. Dinner was very good breakfast less so but still appreciated. This could be a very good trip once the planes are fixed up.",4united-airlines,03/08/14,LAX-ORD-FRA-EWR-LAX last month. All flights arrived on time with no major issues. ORD-FRA on 747 and FRA-EWR on 777. Had upper deck on the 747 and it's the best place on the plane. Less people in a much more secluded environment. On both directions the crew was congenial and the service was top notch. I appreciated being thanked for my business and for flying UA. The United Club in EWR was a bit crowded for my liking but overall a great experience on all 4 legs.

I am disabled and my husband checked the night before to make sure a wheelchair would be ready at the airport. Seattle to Tucson via Phoenix. No wheelchair in Seattle finally after waiting at check-in for 45 minutes the desk clerk was worried I was going to miss the flight and grabbed a wheel chair and I was put on plane at the last minute. Arrived at Phoenix - no wheelchair - person working at desk ignored me. Another passenger interrupted her and told her I needed assistance and I finally got help. Arrived in Tucson - no wheelchair - had to walk from tarmac to baggage. Wheelchair available for another customer - asked the person if he could get one for me he shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Customer service a nightmare - do not want to talk to you in person. The prices are good but they do not care about there customers.,1united-airlines,03/08/14,I boarded UAL 771 July 25th SFO to LAX. I had an International flight to catch on another airline. While I have had my share of grumpy UAL flight attendants I immediately noticed a different energy in the FC cabin when I entered (I bought FC - it was not a complimentary upgrade). There were two male flight attendants being warm and welcoming. They were constantly seeing what passengers needed (it was a 24 seat 757). They knew how to handle every request and not just with a sterile perfunctory smile. The mood among all of the passengers was noticeably different. I'm not sure that many of UAL's FA's know how significant they are in creating an energy on the plane among the people by the way they welcome and serve the passengers. Most FA's know how to serve a cup of water. That does not take much skill. However to serve the water and give the sense that it is done graciously is something else.,10united-airlines,03/08/14,"Flight from ORD to Edinburgh was first delayed and then cancelled at 7pm due to ""aircraft maintenance"". We were told to stay at the gate where a 'recover' team would rebook us onto other flights. It took each agent about 15 minutes to deal with each customer and then after standing in line for an hour we were told that we had to leave the gate as it was needed for another flight. We were told to go and join the back of the long queue at the Customer Services desk across the hall. After standing in line for almost another hour we were told that the best that could be done would be to put us on the flight the next day. Luckily I checked and found an American Airlines flight to London Heathrow leaving at 9.40pm that night with an onward connection to Edinburgh with British Airways. The American and BA staff were courteous and helpful unlike the United staff who didn't seem to give a damn.",2us-airways,12/11/14,PHX-HNL return in economy. Exit row seat so extra legroom. Be warned-any window seat directly behind the exit door has very limited legroom due to the protruding door. Seat 9d is excellent though-able to stretch out. Service friendly and good. Both flights on time even early by a few minutes. Only complaint would be seatmate on the overnight return. Very large man made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. When he sat down and slid back the arm rest rose with his body. Not fun. Entertainment shown on outbound but did not watch.,9us-airways,11/11/14,LGA-DCA-SYR. Flight out of LGA was delayed due to weather and had a very tight connection in DCA but the flight attendants kept reassuring me that I had enough time to make it. Flight to DCA on an E190 and it barely half full which provided a very comfortable flight and legroom and recline were good. No beverage runs this time due to heavy turbulence. Made it to my flight to SYR with a minute to spare this flight on a smaller E170. The flight attendant serving my row was an absolute delight. Per usual like all other major US carriers they lack the polish and finesse of their Asian counterparts. However she was very friendly warm and she made a lot of interaction with me and other passengers. I was given a whole can of Coke which is always nice flight was seamless and arrived on time. I'm also glad that the crew and the airline has a lot of positivity about its ongoing merger with American.,10united-airlines,03/08/14,UA982 12/23/2013. United provided me with the worst traveling experience of my life. I spent 24 hours in Kuwait City airport after a cancelled flight. United gave me the run-around promising flight after flight which were all already overbooked. The only compensation I received was a complimentary hotel room. I got to the hotel at 1.30am and they took me back to the airport at 4am to catch a flight that was of course overbooked. I finally got a flight (on a different airline) 12 hours later. I understand that some circumstances simply cannot be helped. That is the gamble that goes along with travel. It is the being lied to and treated so poorly which made my experience so terrible.,1united-airlines,03/08/14,I write this review sitting in the Milwaukee Wisconsin airport. My flight from Milwaukee to Chicago has been first cancelled then delayed twice. I should have driven to Chicago. Missed two connecting flights. Should have bee in Hartford CT at 10am then 2pm now 4pm. What an absolute joke. When an airline can't provide adequate service from Milwaukee to Chicago they should just fold up their tent and go home. Don't pretend to be a transportation service when you can't transport people as promised. Scheduled this trip specifically to attend a theatre production produced by a friend. Attending that event despite my best planning is being placed in jeopardy by this airline.,1united-airlines,03/08/14,The worst airlines I have flown in years! Kiosks were confusing and not enough help to use them. Both round trip flights from Boston to San Francisco were packed to the gills. Seats were terrible and cramped and it felt like you were sardines. Absolutely no snacks at all! Food offerings looked so bad even the staff said not to buy most of them. They have the audacity on the flight back to charge passengers for direct TV with no free channels at all! No cool circulating air so it felt suffocating! Seats terrible and uncomfortable. Staff agreed with our complaints. Flight was one hour late getting into Boston.,1us-airways,06/11/14,Our weekend was ruined when this airline canceled our flight due to mechanical problems. After sitting in the airport from 7:00am until 3:30pm our 8:30am flight was finally canceled. We repeatedly stood in line to find out what was going only to be told our best bet was to wait for that plane to be repaired. A part was coming at 11:00am and then it was coming at 2:00pm. By the time they received the part and found out it didn't correct the problem it was too late and there were no more flights that day. We were kept in the dark all day unless we went to find out what was going on. When the flight was officially canceled no one even announced it. Wouldn't announcing the cancelation be the least they could do for the customers who spent the entire day waiting. Shame on you US Airways for treating your customers so poorly and barely even offering an apology.,us-airways,06/11/14,Flew from Dublin to Philadelphia (connecting flight to Boston delayed by 3 hours). On board staff never came to aid when call bell rung. On route back from Boston to Philadelphia delayed on the runway for 1.5 hrs due to snow crew told us not to worry if we missed our connecting flight to Dublin and that we could head straight for a flight to London. After running with bags for 20 mins through the airport we were told we could not get on the flight to London and would have to stay the night in Philadelphia. Staff were so rude it was unreal and especially to an elderly couple who missed their flight as a buggy was not allowed to transport them to their gate. Staff did not make us aware that they provided discounts for hotels either.,united-airlines,03/08/14,HKG-SFO July 28 2014 Economy Plus. Quite simply the worst over-pacific flight I've had (I've had about 70+). The United International Economy Plus product is quite simply one of the worst available when aboard a crusty old 747. The IFE was antiquated and the movies were b-movies at best. The plane is old and crusty and desperately in need of an update. Flight attendants were indifferent and nearly tossed meal trays onto your fold down tray. Seats were dilapidated. Flight took off and landed late. This United international product is sub-standard and should be an embarrassment to United Airlines. With Star Alliance partners ANA and Asiana both offering superior product at same price why would anyone fly United? Quite simply the other airlines do a better job on these routes.,2united-airlines,03/08/14,LHR-ORD-LHR. Initial impressions of United were not great as I attempted to check in online only to find that their website system 'could not check you in at this time' after going through the whole process! United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient. I will try to avoid flying with United again until they improve the quality of their product.,3us-airways,28/10/14,Having flown Boston to Honolulu via Phoenix first class with no problem I wasn't anticipating problems on the return journey. I could not have been more wrong. When I got to Phoenix on the return trip I was suddenly bumped to coach! They told me this was due to a change of aircraft and that the crew would treat me as if I was first class passenger. The crew told me there was no change of plane and that I had been bumped in favour of another passenger despite me holding a full first class ticket! I was treated exactly the same as a coach passenger so felt let down disappointed and lied to! I will never fly with US Airways again.,us-airways,28/10/14,Second time I have used US airways and both times have been a disaster. First time from Tucson to Sacramento was delayed in Tucson (no explanation) then when I did get on and had to transfer planes in Phoenix I waited 3 hrs with a boarding pass in front of the gate. When I presented my boarding pass at the gate to get on they told me that the seat was already taken. Spent the night in Phoenix at a hotel because no flights were available. Swore I wouldn't fly them again but I had to get to Columbus Ohio for a wedding - got on the plane on time then sat there when they announced (at least they told us this time) that there were mechanical difficulties. Everyone got off got in a line of at least 100 fellow travelers to rebook it and the best they could do was another flight 10.5h later to arrive the next day (wedding would have already happened). Got my money back at least.,united-airlines,31/07/14,"In May my flight from Newark to Toronto was cancelled due to bad weather - eventually 3 hours after boarding and sitting on the tarmac. I was then left stranded as an international passenger trying to deal with a very surly United ground staff ""customer service agent"" who told me either to sleep overnight in the airport or find a hotel? No help or assistance. I complained to United officially on my return to the UK and in fact they ""granted"" me a voucher for $150 off my next booking. They added that they hoped that this did not give me a bad impression of United. Unfortunately I had already made my next booking to the US with United travelling Belfast to Newark to Knoxville early July. Flights from Newark to Knoxville cancelled two days in a row. As there are 3 of us this time I have to find hotels for 2 nights in a row. One positive that came of this was that United re-routed us to Knoxville via Atlanta using Delta. On the way back from Knoxville via Washington to Newark the United flight was delayed by 2 hours. We are then re-routed from Washington to London then Belfast. It maybe incidental to note that no other airlines had delays at Knoxville that day? At least we get home albeit some 4 hours later than expected. Due to delays in arriving we miss the connection London to Belfast. Luckily this flight is on a British Airways plane so I go to BA and it is sorted - promptly and courteously by a nice customer service lady.",1us-airways,28/10/14,"Flew from Heathrow to Charlotte on 04/10/14. Flight late leaving Heathrow and not enough layover time allowed so we missed our connecting flight to Orlando managed to get another flight early Sunday am (we were booked on a cruise that sailed Sunday afternoon) but spent a very uncomfortable night in Charlotte airport the US Airways staff offered no accommodation food or drink. On our return leg from Charlotte to Heathrow we were delayed over an hour and a half on the plane due to a ""medical issue"" with 2 passengers (This issue should have been picked up long before the passengers were allowed to board). Would I fly with US Airways again? Well just to say Ryanair could teach them something!",us-airways,28/10/14,Direct flight from Charlotte to Salt Lake City. At the designated boarding time flight attendants told a few folks the plane was still in maintenance and we'd board in 15 minutes or so. (no announcement). 15 minutes later they said it would be another 15 minutes. Some time passed and they said they couldn't fix the plane in time so they were going to give us another one. Then they said we were waiting for a storm to pass before they brought the plane from the hanger. They finally got a plane over to the terminal then started trying to find the flight crew who had apparently left the airport. Crew later said they were told the flight was cancelled (although they never told the passengers that). They found the crew boarded zone 1 and 2 then realized the captain was missing so they asked everyone to deboard the plane. A Captain was eventually found. Plane took off 3.5 hours after scheduled time. We wouldn't have known anything that was happening if we hadn't been sitting near the gate desk. Communication was terrible to the passengers. We were basically kept waiting at the gate for 4 hours or so with the belief we would be boarding at any time. On the flip side the flight attendants were friendly pleasant and apologetic.,united-airlines,31/07/14,"First Class from LA to Dulles. When breakfast service came they had cereal and fruit. That's the meal for a $3000 ticket. The attendant repeatedly told me ""That is all we currently have available"". I offered to buy my own breakfast from the coach menu and was informed that I would indeed have to purchase my meal. On my return flight scheduled at 2.30 pm from Dulles the flight was delayed twice then cancelled at 6pm. Provided with a $100 coupon - certainly doesn't pay for a hotel room in DC. My original plan - flying back on the 10.10 pm flight indeed proved irrational. It was also delayed. I asked the customer service agent to put me on American 6.15 flight to LA. She refused pointing out that I was on backup for 10.10 pm with United. She reissued my ticket on American at the coach rate. She also incorrectly copied down the gate to delay my progress. Thankfully they were on the same concourse. When I made it to American I indeed confirmed that there still was an open first class ticket. The lovely American agent called United and unfortunately did no better than I had for the past three hours finding someone who could reissue the ticket as first class. American graciously put me in the last seat without any help and much hindrance from United. I can honestly say that one should strongly consider their well being before booking a United flight.",1united-airlines,31/07/14,Went ORD-DCA-ORD to visit family. On a regional jet the flight was still somewhat comfortable. Coming back to Chicago there was some confusion with passengers who needed to get seats together and while I didn't mind moving I would hope they could try and resolve these things before the plane is full and it becomes hard to move around because of people in aisles etc.,6us-airways,28/10/14,Flew from Las Vegas to Philadelphia and on to Portland. Never have I witnessed such complete incompetence and total disregard for the paying customer. Had to stay the night in the airport as flights were cancelled repeatedly with no explanation. Repeatedly shuttled from one terminal to another while the monitors were either not updated or working at all. We were told to go to customer service. Line was 150 yards long as I paced it. After an hour the same couple was at the counter. Two girls behind the counter. Finally took to the phone for help. At midnight we were told we weren't entitled to food or lodging vouchers as the cancellation's were due to traffic congestion. The only good thing I see is U.S Airways can only go up from here. Worst experience ever.,us-airways,05/10/14,US Airways has an unfair baggage policy. In the interest of efficiency & courtesy I checked by bag only to hear an announcement at the gate that the flight was full and bags would be checked for free! US Airways knew the flight was full at the time I checked my bag and should have told me instead they charged me $50 (round trip).,united-airlines,31/07/14,This is usually a good airline - except when flying out of Santa Barbara CA. They share with Skywest and this is a horrible partnership. The gate agents in SBA are horrific and could not care less about their customers. They canceled our flight and the next flight and the next flight on our anniversary weekend. Their only excuse was that skywest never responds and this always happens. If I offered that at my place of business I would be out of business.,1united-airlines,31/07/14,Had a multi-city going ORD-PEK and NRT-LAX-ORD. First leg was okay with the in-flight entertainment being satisfactory. On the first leg service was acceptable with it seeming the best on my NRT-LAX part of the itinerary. However because I went on standby for an earlier LAX-ORD flight the agent service *inside* the airport was actually quite poor as I was actually yelled at (along with a whole line of delayed passengers) by one of their agents. At this point I plan on only flying United for domestic flights because I'm a Star Alliance Gold member but otherwise there are much better airlines for any future international trips I may take in the future.,6us-airways,05/10/14,Flight US 706 from Charlotte to Frankfurt was delayed for more than five hours due to maintenance. It seemed to be the second time within 6 days. Former records read to it accordingly. Delay came in steps of half hours and hours. Nobody cared whether passengers had to drink or to eat the shops in Charlotte were closed. Our flight US1917 five days earlier from Philadelphia was delayed for two hours. The plane had to return to the gate due to maintenance. The airline always prevented online booking with free luggage although it was already booked. US airlines are not committed to pay penalty. Maybe this is reasonable for the many delays of transatlantic flights. I review this airline as unreliable.,1us-airways,05/10/14,I was returning home from DFW on flight 649 on 9/27/2014 which was supposed to arrive in Phoenix with a connecting flight from Phoenix to San Jose. Instead of landing we circled Phoenix airport for over an hour then were diverted to New Mexico. After sitting on the tarmac for over 4 hours at Albuquerque airport we were told that the flight had to be canceled. Upon exiting the plane we were told to contact customer service (800 number). We were told that no reimbursements for hotels would be made and that there were no flights available that we could get on until the following Monday. I was told to ask about flight 9011 the next day which flew to Phoenix. The agent said she could put me on that flight but any flights continuing to San Jose the same day were not available. Later that evening I found a flight out of Phoenix to San Jose on Priceline for $337.00 and booked it so I could get home. Guess which airline that was on? US Airways! US Airways had one agent at the ticketing counter the following morning and over 187 people in line. Two days later I pulled up my unused ticket to request a refund and it shows a connecting ticket which I was not told about nor did I use and I am outraged! This was our second trip on US Airways - thinking it couldn't happen twice the first time we were diverted and had to drive 2 states to make a cruise! Again - no reimbursements!,united-airlines,31/07/14,First class on 767-400 round trip Newark-Honolulu. Seat and entertainment couldn't be better. Meal service was an embarrassment in both directions. Departed Newark 9.15am served an omelette an hour later then not a morsel until an inedible cheeseburger an hour before landing. Departed Honolulu 8.10pm served a snack of hummus peppers feta with a bag of chips then not a morsel until an inedible breakfast sandwich 45 minutes before landing. I politely complained and was offered a chicken wrap from economy. I offered to pay but money refused. This is not a route with complimentary upgrades. Everyone paid to sit up front. I can't understand why UA continues to alienate customers.,5united-airlines,31/07/14,I checked in and went to gate and all was fine for our flight from SFO to Portland. Went to have lunch and came back 10 mins before boarding there was a cancellation of our flight. The next flight and all fights were full leaving from any airport Oakland San Jose etc. They could not accommodate us on any flight until the next morning. I ended up driving 12 hours. I am so disappointed that we were not notified ahead of time even just a couple of hours and I could have made other arrangements. The worst part is the cancellation was due to them being understaffed! Ridiculous reason and poor planning on their part.,1us-airways,01/10/14,CLT-BOS. It's advertised online as 2+ hours but the flight only took 95 minutes. No issues on the ground or in the air. They went around with drinks and I thought they would provide snacks so I asked the attendant for a snack. I was surprised to later learn that snacks aren't free but the flight attendant never charged me. Return flight was delayed 30 minutes supposedly because of the issues in Chicago. Somebody made a snarky comment to flight attendant she definitely heard it but wisely ignored it. No other issues on the ground or in the air. It's always funny flying into Charlotte b/c majority of people aboard are switching planes. While others were making a mad dash to their next plane I was taking an easy stroll in the terminal.,8us-airways,01/10/14,Savannah to Philadelphia (equipment change) to Buffalo. Embraer 175 on both legs. Flights left on time arrived on time. First Class was just ok - expensive fare class but worth it for pre-boarding more space and a limited beverage/snack service. FAs were cordial not overly friendly.,7united-airlines,31/07/14,I have flown UA 4 times from DEN-LGA over the last 2 months; As a Gold card holder I have been upgraded on 5/8 segments. Surprisingly all flights have been on time and even one landed 20 min early. In First UA is decent though they could learn from Delta about better food. All crew were friendly and actually smiled and were chatty with passengers. In Coach most crew also seemed decent and I like their snack boxes. Main problem is lack of consistent product with some aircraft with Wi-Fi some with PTVs and some with nothing. DEN and SFO based crews clearly nicer then EWR based ones.,8united-airlines,29/07/14,"Because I wanted to try a 787 I flew LAX-Shanghai then returned on a 747-400 Shanghai-SFO. While the seats are more-or-less simulated business class and the entertainment selection is quite good the service quality is the worst in my 35 year experience. The ""flight attendants"" apparently come to work only to qualify for free travel as they most certainly do not go out of their way to provide anything approaching ""service"". The meals and drinks were delivered with all of the passion one expects when one of these veterans delivers the FAA pre-flight announcements. I despised making any contribution to wages these people did not earn. Given a choice between United and Aeroflot I'll likely choose Aeroflot. I fly 10-12 times per year and make the Asia flight 406 times annually this round trip is the worst I've had in 35 years of travel. My advice: fly anyone but United.",1us-airways,28/09/14,17/8/2014: Boston - Philadelphia - Munich: I used BA business lounge in Philadelphia which was really nice and then I tried out US Airways business lounge which was big but nothing much to offer. After boarding the plane I was very surprised to see the seating was very nice and comfortable. I was able to sleep all the way to Munich after dinner. The staff were very friendly and the whole experienced with US Airways was a very good one.,7us-airways,19/09/14,Over the summer my family and I flew to Fort. Myers on US Airways. On the way there we flew from Indianapolis to Charlotte to Fort. Myers. The flight was pretty average. On the way back though I have some complaints. We flew Fort. Myers to Washington Reagan to Indianapolis. On the flight back to Indy from Washington we were on a smaller Embraer jet. The Plane's condition was terrible. Multiple overhead bins were broken and at my seat the wall panel was falling off! I could see the insulation of the plane. Also all over my seat belt was gum. It was very disgusting and I could not change seats because it was a full flight. I'm willing to give US Airways another chance though. I would also recommend them to a friend because 3/4 flights were alright.,7united-airlines,29/07/14,I was flying from Orlando to Vegas with connection in Houston. First flight was delayed about 4 hours (not due to weather so it was just because of United and their lack of or poor maintenance of planes). This made me miss my connecting flight so I had to wait in the huge line to get a flight to Vegas. I finally made it to Vegas about 5 hours later. They didn't apologize or give me anything for the inconvenience. Then the day came for my flight back to Orlando which I was dreading. My flight from Vegas to Houston wasn't too delayed so I figured it was a good day. Boy was I wrong. I arrive in Houston at around 2.30pm only to find out that my flight back home was cancelled and they put me on a flight to Orlando the next day at 9pm. I had to wait in the massive customer service line to see if I could get on an earlier flight. After about an hour I get to the front and they told me they can put me on a flight to Jersey with a connection to Orlando. It would get me home by 1am so I figured to do that. Well surprise surprise the flight to Jersey was delayed which made me miss the flight to Orlando which was the last flight. I had to stay the night in Jersey at the airport because they wouldn't pay for any hotel. All in all they had me hopping from state to state like if this was a game and never apologized. I'll never fly with them again.,1united-airlines,29/07/14,"UA 922 20 July: My name is one of three called out for last boarding due to delayed UA 1711 flight from Boston to Newark due to a mechanical problem as we were told. The delay did not augur well for my not-so-pleasant experience in the flight: no water in the loo food was miserable (the sweet sour chicken meal was kind of soupy and was tasteless) and one particular stewardess was quite snappy. The good thing was the uneventful flight which was a relief considering the week's news. Another good thing was my ""seatmate"" was transferred next to family so I had two seats to myself. My ""no"" recommendation was specifically for this plane and crew.",5us-airways,19/09/14,PHL-LAX-PHL September 3-9. I went out to Los Angeles for a vacation on US Airways. When I arrived at Philadelphia airport to my surprise the check-in and TSA lines were not crowded at all for it being a Hub. As for the flight it was uneventful. It left on time and arrived to LAX few minutes early. Flight was smooth but trying to sleep and relax in those coach seats was uncomfortable. The flight coming back left on time as well and flight went smoothly. Since US Airways is about to be the only airline to be non-stop to between Philly and Los Angeles once Virgin America stops its flights in October looks I'll have no choice but to use US Airways as I personally hate connecting flights.,5united-airlines,29/07/14,When boarding United flight 919 from LHR to IAD on July 22 2014 I was mortified to be humiliated by a flight attendant because I could not reach the overhead bin to stow my carry on bag. The plane is large and I am 5'1 not tall enough to reach the bin. At 69 I also do not have strength to lift a bag over my head. Berating this to me she said if I could not put the bag in the bin myself then it would have to be checked. Other passengers were shocked at her response to my predicament and of course a kindly tall gentleman immediately put it in the bin for me. On departing the aircraft a tall woman who had heard the attendant earlier came over to take down the bag. The attendant's attitude and manner was very rude. I was in seat 27D for which I had to pay an extra $125. I have been flying across the Atlantic for 53 years. This was my first and hopefully last trip I'll make on United.,1united-airlines,29/07/14,"Being from New Zealand I have to fly all the time just to get anywhere! Hence am used to flying all round the world multiple airlines. United Airlines are the worst airline I have flown and would not recommend them to any traveler. My Honolulu to Newark flight 2 days ago was cancelled. The reason? ""The plane didn't arrive"". No explanation. No food voucher (not that we were going to get fed on a 10 hr flight anyway). Grumpy ground staff who obviously had had no customer service training. Luckily got reconnected through Delta who were obliging helpful and got us into NYC with no problem. United's aircraft are old there staff are lazy and unhelpful and they are years behind European Asian and Pacific airlines in regards customer service. Star Alliance should dump them.",1us-airways,17/09/14,We traveled from Charlotte NC to Paris France in late August and had booked in Envoy class. Much to our total amazement we were loaded onto a 30 year plane with old business class seats that did not lie flat and were worn out and hard as a board it was like trying to sleep on a teeter-totter. They gave us an old ipad for entertainment. Food was horrible and the flight attendants went up front and closed the drapes. Impossible to get even a drink. When I called US airways they offered nothing for their false advertising. If we allow airlines to treat us with disrespect it will continue to happen. I know it won't make a difference but I nor my husband will ever fly US airways or American again. It is the only small way that we can voice or extreme displeasure about being treated so poorly. They didn't even respond to my email.,us-airways,17/09/14,"On our last US Airways trip the return from Athens was a complete disaster. I verified my seats and flights twice in the week before I left home. I brought a printed copy of the itinerary from their website. At the airport I was told that ""you don't have seats on the first leg of your journey from Athens to Zurich (Swiss Air). I see your reservation but for some reason US Airways cancelled your seats on that portion of the trip. The flight is full you don't have seats call them. Step aside."" I did call US Airways - on hold for long stretches while their personnel verified that it was the next day in Athens vs. where the customer service is located in the U.S. and while they tried to put me on a flight now leaving in 1/2 hour. We ran to the Lufthansa check-in as instructed - after repeated attempts to get tickets we were told by Lufthansa that they could see the reservation but US Airways hadn't completed the task and we couldn't get on board. I called US Airways again in front of the Lufthansa check-in (more time on hold despite explaining that we had less than 1/2 hour to get tickets clear security and get to the gate). They verified that the last agent had not completed our reservation in Lufthansa's system. They now instructed us to go to Swiss Air and get the same tickets since they were codeshare partners on the Lufthansa flight. While explaining that Swiss Air was where we started and on the other side of the airport the announcement closing that flight was made. US Airways then stated they could do nothing until the next day's flight to get us out. I asked for a supervisor. The supervisor reiterated that nothing from Athens was available until the next day. I told her that I could see online that several flights were available to European gateway cities that morning but was told that US Airways couldn't put me on those flights. She was more helpful when I offered to get us to any European gateway on my dime but then told me that all the flights from London Paris Rome Amsterdam Munich etc. were full. My wife tried again and did reach someone that routed us to Paris and home on Air France. Air France was a welcome change and they actually worked to correct more US Airways problems created during re-booking us. I always thought the day would come where US Airways would turn the corner and become a great airline (and I've waited a long time) but I've officially lost interest in being around to see it.",united-airlines,29/07/14,My wife and I flew from San Diego to Paris France. On the return trip the video on the plane was inoperative and we flew 10 hours with no movies or sound. The second leg from Washington to San Diego had no video screens available on the plane and the power plug under our seat did not charge our electronic device so we could not watch a movie we had downloaded as we used up our battery on the previous flight from Paris. To top it off one of our bags didn't arrive with the rest of our luggage and hasn't turned up a day later. Needless to say the airlines should have compensated us for the lack of video service during an international flight. The missing luggage might turn up hopefully! The crew were excellent. Not their fault!,2united-airlines,29/07/14,United 941 flight taken 10 July 2014: If UA flights can clone the pilots stewardesses and stewards in this flight and put them in each one in their fleet UA will score 10/10. Leg room of the economy seats was quite a problem. I had cramps so I had to move to the backmost seat which was free. I spent the duration of the entire flight from Heathrow to Newark (connecting flight) catching up with my readings. Seeing that I was busy and not relaxing at all the crew were nice and even gave me a box of chocolates! I must mention that the touchdown was the best I have experienced. My recommendation is based purely on this flight alone.,10us-airways,17/09/14,I fly with US Airways a lot and they are average nothing special. Flying from CLT-SAN we usually leave on time a few minutes early even. But ever since they removed inflight entertainment on their domestic flights a 5 hour flight on an A320 is a little long. Make sure to bring your own things for movies and music Airbus A320 was older with some signs of age and grime on it taffy stuffed into what used to be a power port on my armrest 2 skittles stuck to the carpet under my seat leather was worn as well. Cabin Crew were nice and attentive drinks and snacks were average though their marketplace meals are not as quality. Just a few days before our trip US Airways changed our flight numbers and if I had not looked at the reservation again I might have been in a little trouble in finding the gate. If you don't like spending a lot of money try not to bring huge suitcases that need to be checked as US Airways charges 25 extra dollars per bag each way. US Airways is an average airline nothing very special.,7us-airways,14/09/14,"I booked my trip through Orbitz. The trip was ""must be there on time"" type of trip. I was very pleased that check in was made easy to do online I had no problems with baggage as I carried only 1 bag with me. We traveled from DFW to Charlotte NC then onto Charleston WV. The plan for the first leg of the trip was excellent my only critique would be on that 2nd leg of the trip which was in a much smaller plane and the seats were pretty ""snug"". However we were on time the entire way there. On the way back our trip was delayed from leaving almost 2 hrs but there had been storms that had come through which had thrown many other flights off and I guess that was natures fault. All the staff was very friendly. They served only a beverage as our trips were short and I didn't mind. I would recommend us airways to anyone and look forward to flying with them again.",9united-airlines,27/07/14,This is the second time I have flown United. The first time was without incident. Great trip just lots of stops. This time however the plane I was getting on in Albany was late arriving and thus we were late taking off. This resulted in our flight arriving in Newark too late to catch the connection flight. Not only was I now delayed a day but I was told by the airline that I would likely have to travel to LaGuardia by bus or taxi but they would not cover the cost. This is insane. Also the airline did not seem to have any thought of giving a discount. I purchased a service and the service was not provided. In any other industry I would not pay for this. This will be the last time I travel with United. I will pay the extra money and take a more reliable airline.,1united-airlines,27/07/14,Flew YYC-IAH yesterday on B737 and have to say nice flight mainly because of the class of service and the nice crew on board. Plane interior had seen better times and looked a bit outdated. Delay almost made up during flight. The friendly skies are much more friendly in Business than in Economy and unfortunately the gap between the 2 classes are way too big. In the future I hope United will shine some friendly 'skylight' towards the back of the planes to really earn the friendly sky status for all classes.,9us-airways,14/09/14,Do not use this airline especially out of YEG. I have never complained about a flight before. We had the exact experience with a cancelled flight from YEG to PHX as a previous post David had because of crew members not showing up. This was a 6.20am flight and was cancelled while we were in line to board. US Airways were extremely rude in re-routing us it was a take it or leave it proposal. And my experience continues to be horrible as I continue to deal with their customer service. Do not use this airline!,us-airways,14/09/14,I have just returned from a holiday to Miami Florida which went from Heathrow and stopped in Charlotte. I wanted to write a review as I read others before I left and they were mostly all really bad so I was terrified about what to expect. I'm pleased to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by my travel experience. All flights left on time and were early arriving we actually got back into Heathrow 45 minutes earlier than expected! Staff were pleasant the flight was smooth and there was plenty of room in our seats we all had our own touch screen TV with so many films to choose from it was excellent. Even the food was good it was free on the transatlantic flight and we just bought our own snacks for the domestic flight however all flights had complimentary drinks which was more than I expected on the domestic ones. I have to say it's a shame for those that have had a bad experience but I want people to know that it a great airline to use and it will always be my first choice in the future.,10united-airlines,27/07/14,LAX-SFO one-way on B757-200. Surprisingly United has installed a good IFE system with updated blockbusters collection. Enjoyed my snacks and sweet apple juice on board. Speaker a bit too loud but all in all a surprisingly pleasant experience for such a short flight as 2 hours.,10us-airways,14/09/14,"Flight US735 Manchester to Philadelphia on 2nd August cancelled due to - you have guessed it - maintenance problems. Managed to fly out on Monday 4th missing a full 2 days of holiday. We will never fly with them again perhaps we should have known they even messed up the return booking after they changed our route back and failed to book our granddaughter with us even though the flights had been ""linked"" they had a 7 year old flying on her own. The food was also inedible.",us-airways,10/09/14,I paid extra to have shorter lay over times. Instead we were stuck on the San Juan airport for 5 hours because the plane was late and we missed our connecting flight. That was on the way to St Thomas. On our way home we were delayed again because they had maintenance problems. Sat in the airport another 3 hours than 4 hours then 5 hours before they finally got us on a plane.,united-airlines,27/07/14,Nice seats smiling staff and cutting every corner in First Class on an ORD-FRA route. Four croutons on my salad and ordinary less costly meal choices. 2 mid-priced white wines offered and wasn't even offered a refill during the meal. Had to pay 16.95 USD for WiFi despite a 10000+ USD ticket. Crew has rules about bags on the floor on take-off (even underneath the pod in First Class) and requests we wear shoulder plus lap belts - unlike other airlines. Even check-in was below par no dedicated lines. Nice big seats and big meal portions but equal or less than many other airlines' business class at double the price.,3united-airlines,27/07/14,"United has recently changed its airplane (routing from PVG-ORD) from a 777 with personalized on-board entertainment in economy to a ""new"" 747 was shared projection screens. Also they recently changed their US/Asia route to also require payment for alcoholic beverages for those not in business or first-class. Travelling from China to the US quite often the 13+ hour flight seems even longer now that I have no control over what I can watch and no free drinks to ""shorten"" the travel time. In addition to these new changes the United crew has always been less than pleasant. It seems that the passengers are an inconvenience and I have heard the crew yell at each other on more than one occasion. Given the above I have changed my frequent flier membership to another Star Alliance airline and avoid flying United at all costs. It's just not worth the pain when flying that far and that long.",1us-airways,06/09/14,I have just returned from a holiday to Las Vegas which went from Glasgow & stopped in Philly. I wanted to write a review as I read others before I left and they were mostly all really bad so I was terrified about what to expect. I'm pleased to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by my travel experience. All flights left on time and were early arriving we actually got back into Glasgow 45 minutes earlier than expected!

I have to say it's a shame for those that have had a bad experience but I want people to know that it doesn't always have to be bad.,10us-airways,06/09/14,"Flight 614 Phoenix to Atlanta was three times delayed. Instead of 9.50pm arrival on 9/1 we arrived at 3am on 9/2. In Phoenix after we loaded and taxied out a mechanical problem was encountered. We deplaned and two hours later got a new plane. Although entire plane was loaded we waited 45 minutes for the same two pilots to show up for this second aircraft. This plane finally pulled out of the gate about 7.20pm and after a short taxi back into another gate to check an allegation of a supposed ""bulging window seal"" on an A320 which a passenger claimed to have seen. You cannot see window seals from the interior of the aircraft. This supposed mechanical problem for which no repair measures were taken prevented us from leaving Phoenix until 9pm Pacific. It was a very unpleasant seemingly unnecessary experience as to the allegations of mechanical trouble on the second plane and the pilot delay in simply arriving at the aircraft.",united-airlines,27/07/14,London - Newark June 14 2014. I used my miles to purchase a ticket back to New York last month and was a bit nervous because I hadn't flown with United in a while and wasn't sure how the quality would be. Luckily it was better than I expected! The entertainment was pretty old and barely usable unless I wanted to go deaf by turning up the volume to its max. Since I wasn't using it flight crew asked me to swap with a couple who had a broken machine which I did. The crew member then forgot to give me my drink skipping my row completely until I reminded him. I was a bit annoyed but you know staff get busy and flustered. I enjoyed my flight smooth and got home safely so cannot fault it. One thing that made me smile is that an older crew member who witnessed me giving up my seat and then getting my drink forgotten thanked me personally and talked about how the crew really wanted to encourage good experiences for everyone. Anyway I quite liked the flight so well done United.,8united-airlines,27/07/14,Ever since Continental merged with United it has been downhill. My flights are repeatedly delayed for various reasons but mainly due to technical issues because they have so many old planes still in service. On my most recent flight my flight was delayed for five hours. The plane did not show up for three hours due to 'weather grounding' which was totally false because the weather was fine in Houston even if there were thunderstorms it would not have grounded for three hours. Then we were boarded and the pilot mentioned they had technical issues. I still do not understand why they would board an entire plane before knowing if/how long it would take to repair everyone sat in the plane for two hours until they were finally able to fix and take off. We were told to contact United for 'compensation' due to the trouble and I was offered $50 (only because I have status otherwise it would have been $25) due to our inconvenience. Apparently a new policy just instituted to give you even less because in the past for something similar I received $100 and $150. They do not even care anymore about customer service so I am moving onto another airline.,1united-airlines,27/07/14,We booked a flight from SFO to LAX on United and a separate flight from LAX to Europe. Layover in LAX was supposed to be 5 hours - but rather safe than sorry is what I thought - and sorry we were to be: Upon entering the aircraft doors closed we were informed of a minor delay due to traffic restrictions. A while later a technical problem was added to the mix and they promised to keep us informed. It kept going on like this for a while until about two hours later we were released from the plane and tried to get on the next flight. After a total of three hours the ticketing agent kindly re-booked us on a Delta flight to LAX. We landed just in time to possibly make it on our next plane but the surprise was that our baggage was still on the original plane. So we had to wait even longer in LAX re-book the flight till next day find a hotel and so on. I asked UA ground crew if they could offer assistance with any of it hoping my star alliance gold card might come in handy. It certainly did not. The essence of this trip is: You are most welcome as a client as long as you pay and shut up!,1us-airways,06/09/14,"I don't fly a lot but when I do I expect professional staff service. I have not have this issue with other carriers. Anyway I just got back from a trip to Myrtle Beach NC. Our connecting flight from Charlotte to MB was delayed 45 minutes. The plane was just there. When the announcer made the call she didn't announce our boarding zone. We waited and had to get up there. We told her we didn't hear her calling the zone she rudely replied ""ah I did"". Gate c29 on Tuesday 3ish 8/26/14. On our way back at gate c10 from Charlotte to Phil on Friday at 8.05pm 8/29/14 the announcer mumbled and lots of passengers didn't understand what he was announcing. We didn't know our boarding zone was called. Both times we didn't get a proper update on the flight status at Charlotte.",5us-airways,06/09/14,MUC-PHL-ORD on Sept 2. A330-200 from MUC - mechanical issue that delayed departure for almost 2 hours. They kept saying it would be 10 minutes but that stretched out every time. Once on board the flight was good - seat comfortable and good food. Great AVOD. Landed an hour late and ran through immigration and security to get to my ORD flight. A321 wasn't full - departed on time and sat on the runway for 2 hours due to a storm that came just as we were taken back to the terminal. Other planes were taking off so not sure if the reason they gave for the delay (air traffic couldn't route us around the storm) was honest. Landed 3 hours late in Chicago - crew was very friendly at least.,7united-airlines,27/07/14,"Economy-plus from EWR-HKG. Staff at the airport were very friendly and in-flight were pleasant. For a 16 hour flight I was dreading the experience as I am 6'6"" tall. The seat was actually reasonably roomy and thankfully the middle seat of three was vacant. The idea that United now charges for alcoholic beverages on even such a long haul flight really sets them apart from their competition in a bad way. The food was probably the worst I've ever had on an airline and that's saying a lot. Entertainment options were fine but the remote control at y seat did not work and the touchscreen worked only badly. Watched one movie and then slept. Overall though I felt as though I was flying on a budget airline and I wasn't! United step up your game!",5united-airlines,20/07/14,My worst flight was 2 weeks ago with United. My original flight was re-routed due to delays and not being able to make my connection. My re-routed trip had a connection which was delayed several times. Several passengers requested clarity to the problem and were given vague excuses and lied to several times. When the final flight was boarding I along with several others were denied boarding as the plane provided was not large enough to accommodate all reservations. I spent that night in the airport and flew to a different location the next day. The staff were unprofessional and created nothing but frustration and anger for many passengers. The planes were uncomfortable and I felt as if we were cattle being driven to our destination. I will never choose United again.,1us-airways,06/09/14,I was booked on a non stop flight from Philadelphia to Seattle. I arrived at the airport and was told that I was too late to check my baggage. They said I needed to be there 45 minutes before the flight departed and that I was 5 minutes too late. The woman at the desk was rude and uncooperative saying that the policy says 45 minutes and I was late. I found another agent and she said all that she could do was put me on another flight leaving 10 minutes later but it was not a non stop and I would get to sea title 5 hours later than the first flight. The policy I found online at their web site states you must be at the airport 30 minutes before your flight departs to check a bag. This is not the fist time I have had problems with US Airways since their take over by American but it will definitely be my last. I will never fly US Airways or American again.,us-airways,06/09/14,Travelled to Orlando via Philly and had a bad trip due to the incompetence of US Airways. Booked for a family of 6 (4 adults and 2 children 6 and 8) and was given split seats. I was told by the staff that we should ask the people who were in the seats next to some of us if they would move to let our family stay together. Got to Philly and heard a blurb over the tannoy so I went to the desk and asked about it and was abruptly told to wait. Asked again about sitting together only to be told the same thing again at least that's standardisation for you. The return flight was worse with inconsiderate flight attendants no back of the seat screen and again had to sort ourselves out with other families. I will never ever fly with US Airways again abysmal company.,united-airlines,20/07/14,I find that United ground crew in particular seem to delight in going out of their way to be surly (on a good day) or nasty (typically). We flew coach today but honestly it doesn't seem to make a difference. Continental was a great airline that was merged with a terrible one and since the merger we have tried to avoid United wherever possible. Old United equipment substandard IFE overall bad attitudes no matter which cabin you find yourself in. Flying United is an endurance marathon. If we fly up front I am annoyed that we spent money or miles for bad attitudes. When we fly in the back I am annoyed by horrible service inedible food (we bring our own now) and shabby cabins. It's time for the United brand to retire.,3united-airlines,20/07/14,"I booked a ""direct"" flight from Berlin Germany to Newark NJ USA and instead of being direct once we got to the airport we were told the airplane would be stopping to fuel up in Maine (obviously not for our flight but for the one after ours). Furthermore having made this trip from Germany/USA several times with other various airlines in comparison United has old planes and less amenities. Lastly there was no way to request a special meal from their website I looked and looked but the meal option was continually grayed out and ended up having to call customer service - another inconvenience.",4us-airways,01/09/14,Trip from Rio to Toronto via US Charlotte (US Airways hub). One plane was canceled without any information to passengers. Staff were rude and not accommodating. Difficult to believe that being in the hub no other planes were available. It looks like their planes get a lot of mechanical problems. After my letter to airline requesting partial reimbursement for the ticket and meals during the 6 hrs of delay I was offered credit/points which I should use within one year. I am not planning to fly with US Airways anyway so there credits/points are useless.,us-airways,01/09/14,Against my better judgement I used our compensation from our cancelled US Airways flights to SFO in summer 2013 to (partially) pay for flights to Florida this summer. On the way home to Dublin Phil/Dub flights cancelled after 6 hours of zero info. Put on flights to Chicago the next day. Chicago/Dublin flight cancelled that night after 5 hours of zero information. I managed to book my family onto a 'decent' airline (Aer Lingus) and we made it onto a flight that night after lots of running between terminals. Two weeks later our bags have not arrived. I plan to drive to Dublin airport today and demand our bags back.,united-airlines,20/07/14,We scheduled a flight from Dayton OH. to Boston with a connection going to Boston in Newark and another connection flying back with a connection in Chicago. Not once did we depart on-time. Newark was a disaster. We had our flight cancelled obtained a second flight but the customer service rep never suggested we try to get an earlier standby flight. Nobody called us from standby until I questioned the boarding attendant minutes prior to takeoff but managed to get onto the plane only to sit on the runway for over an hour because of a backup radio malfunction which ultimately caused the flight to be cancelled. After 7 hours we made it to Boston. Going home we arrived in Chicago and again on United's commuter connection we had another 2 hour wait while something on the plane was fixed. Service was poor especially in Newark where there were two hundred people waiting at customer service to rebook and two reps staffing the computers talking on a phone and letting a plane load of customers wait. Bottom line is that I almost could have driven to Boston from my home in Ohio and not lost much time.,1united-airlines,20/07/14,I am appalled with the way I was treated by this airline. My connecting flight was canceled and no other accommodations were made for an entire flight. When I was told that I would have to stay at the airport for 10 hours for the next available seat my only option was driving to my final destination. The staff had no answers to my questions. When I went to get my baggage I was told it would be about 2 hours before my 1 suitcase would be brought to the carousel. The woman at baggage claim did not follow through and my suitcase was sent to another airport. I had to drive to get my bag from the other airport. I received nothing but frustration for all of the airlines mistakes. Terrible start to my vacation and I will never book with United again.,1us-airways,01/09/14,ORD-PHL-MUC on August 28. A320 from ORD to PHL - departed early and landed early. Crew was very friendly and came through multiple times for trash pick up after their drink run. Connection was 2 hours to a full A330-200 to Munich. Boarding was well organized. Had aisle seat in front part of economy - seat comfort was good and AVOD was slow but great content. Flight attendants were not unfriendly but not super friendly. Chicken for dinner was yummy and filling. Landed 30 min early to Munich. Overall I was impressed with my first international trip on US Airways. And couldn't beat the fare - bought 5 days ahead at $700 round-trip.,7us-airways,01/09/14,"The actual safety of the flight and the technical competence of the crew appears to be outstanding. But I would tell US Airways management that the customer service is only fair (C to a C-/D+). The flight attendants appeared stressed and not really emitting a feeling that they were glad to have the customers aboard. The food was two meatballs and one broccoli spear. I know economy class should not whine but the meal looked so pitiful. The movie for my cross Atlantic flight (going and returning 2 weeks later was the ""Muppet Movie""). The earphones that were passed out for the movie did not work and the advertised other entertainment channels were not working either. US Airways has so much potential.",5united-airlines,20/07/14,I flew out of LAX at 6 am July 9 2014. The flight took off at its scheduled time. The only complaint I had concerning this flight is it makes no sense to me for the airline to load the front of the plane first. It would be more efficient and there would be far less congestion in the front of the aircraft. For the flight from LAX the ground staff were very sloppy and inattentive. United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up. I was pleased to see the staff at Dulles for my return flight were enforcing the rules and numerous passengers had to check over sized carry-ons. Charging an extra $25 for the first checked bag will preclude my flying United in the future.,10united-airlines,17/07/14,This week will be the last time I fly United Airlines. I made the mistake of doing a status match program after having Delta status for years simply because I thought that there was better options for flights into my business territory Canada. Today is the final straw in what has been a nightmarish year of unavoidable layovers constant delays cancelled flights and the worst customer service experience possible. I had a flight to Halifax scheduled today. I get to Newark airport for my 2 hour layover and see that my flight is leaving from Concourse A which has no lounge or other comfortable place to get work done. I take the dingy bus to Concourse B/C to use the lounge. While in the lounge I wasted a good hour trying to get Internet to work. I went to the front desk and reported that the Wifi was very slow. The lady behind the desk said that no one else had reported this then went on talking about her vacation pay hours remaining with another United employee. When I arrived in the lounge initially I asked while checking in if they were announcing all flights and was told yes. I did also hear them announce many flights but there was never an announcement for mine. I realized it was 7.05 and my flight left at 7.30. I raced to the bus to Concourse A by the time I arrived at Gate A20 was told that I would not be going to Halifax. I went to the customer care line where I stood for over 5 minutes while 2 agents ignored me. I sat there for almost 10 minutes while she typed away without saying a word to me. Finally she started telling me there was a flight from Houston tomorrow but no seats on it. I heard a passenger next to me say something about a flight to Moncton and asked the agent next to me if there was a flight to Moncton tonight. I asked the staff member to look into the Moncton flight and without saying a word she got up and walked away. Finally got onto the Moncton flight which left 40 minutes late. Again no apologies for the inconvenience to us passengers who foolishly chose to spend our money with United.,1us-airways,20/08/14,"I was booked on a US Airways flight scheduled to depart from Philadelphia to Orlando at 6.50 am (that plane's first flight of the day). US Airways did not check and make sure that the plane was ready to go the previous night or earlier that morning so we went through an endless list issues with the plane. About 6.5 hours after its scheduled departure time (including over 5 hours of being forced to stay on the plane) US Airways cancelled its flight and left us all to find another flight. By the time all the mechanical issues were finally resolved there was bad weather in Orlando so conveniently the US Airways records state that the flight was cancelled due to weather issues. If the flight had left on time there would be no weather issues. Because they are now hanging their hat on the ""weather issues"" they have completely dismissed any responsibility they have for the numerous mechanical delays.",us-airways,18/08/14,Return flights from Manchester (UK) - Charlotte (USA) - Las Vegas (USA). Very disappointed with these flights. OK with the domestic flight you don't expect much. A seat which was comfy enough and one or two drinks runs. Bog standard plane no inflight entertainment and had to pay for wifi. Fine for the four hour domestic flight. Transatlantic though different matter. On a Boeing 757. Same comfy seats (all seats were in the extra legroom section but the actual seats were the same in normal economy). Very dated entertainment as in TVs down the centre isle therefore no choice what to watch or when. No wifi on the planes either. Even if it was the same wifi as on the domestic flight it didn't give the chance to use streaming services such as netflix etc. The result? A very boring 10 hours on a plane. Food was OK nothing special or bad apart from the kids meal. We reserved one for our 5 year old in case the normal meal was a bit too adult for a kids palate. As it turned out the normal meal would have been fine for ours. But the kids meal consisted of chicken nuggets or similar potato croquettes and sweetcorn followed by biscuits and grapes. Breakfast was a bagel with butter and jam. We had a lovely blueberry muffin. A bit of common sense would have been to keep the puddings and breakfasts the same throughout just change the main meal to suit. Drinks runs were at the start and the end of the flight only. You had to call them in between.,3united-airlines,17/07/14,Recently flew business class with United from Narita to IAD. For my $13000 r-t ticket I got the narrowest business class seat I've ever been in. They squeeze 8 across in their 777s including 4 abreast in the center aisle. Basically an unfriendly cabin staff that showed little initiative in anticipating customer needs and were inflexible and downright rude in enforcing cabin protocol (use of first class rest rooms when business class facilities were wait listed even though the only people in first class were the second pilot and co-pilot). Food was mediocre and served with little flair.,2united-airlines,17/07/14,Would not recommend anyone use this airline. Cancelled our flight and did not get booked until the following day. Lines were long in Kansas City had 2 people working. The facilities are old or not functioning. Worst travel experience ever!,1us-airways,18/08/14,Booked over a month in advance for my wife and I. Then try to check in online the night before and they have us in different rows both flights. When I called the agent said maybe because we have different names. Really? So even if you book at the same time they assume you are not together? First flight we were able to get seats together arranged by agent at front desk but connecting flight the flight crew told us to ask people in the seats if they would switch with us. Thankfully a passenger was more accommodating than the airline staff.,7us-airways,18/08/14,My wife and I recently traveled from our home in South Carolina to San Francisco and back. The trip west was uneventful and Delta was fine. But the US Air flight from San Francisco to Charlotte NC at 1.05pm on Aug 13 2014 we saw two attendants ahead of us but as only one taking boarding passes. There was a second attendant who was looking at everyone's carry-on bags. When my wife passed the boarding pass scanner she rudely told my wife she couldn't board because she had three carry-on items - a purse a book bag and an envelope. She made my wife put the envelope into the book bag. I have no clue what made this US Air employee so spectacularly unable to deal with the public on this day but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Nearly every passenger on the plane about 190 of us were commenting about the scene we had witnessed. And all felt the same as I. I flew the other half of my flight on Delta.,united-airlines,17/07/14,On 10 July Flight 4857 was delayed 2 hours awaiting incoming aircraft. On 13 July Flight 4856 was delayed 3 hours due to mechanical on inbound then further delayed for unknown reasons. Connection in Dulles was missed and later flights to Colorado Springs were unavailable. Attempts to rebook into Denver were unsuccessful as they were also delayed multiple times into early AM hours. Travel from Dulles to Colorado Springs was rebooked for 14 July on Flight 6349. That flight was delayed and subsequently cancelled. Travel was rebooked on Flight 1694 to Csprings via Denver though downgraded from business class to economy. That flight was delayed due to crew issues so the Denver COS connection was missed as well. Travel was rebooked on 6259 which arrived in CSprings on 14 July at 10:.56pm. The gate people were very helpful but the system was unresponsive and they were basically victims as well. Having been loyal United customers for 30 years this sort of thing has become the norm over the last few years predictably unpredictable. They have lost our business.,1united-airlines,17/07/14,"I flew with United for the first time back in June/July flying non-stop on the new service between Edinburgh and Chicago and on to Wausau. I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the ""Premium Access"" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus. I had a scheduled stop over of six hours but United decided to double it to 12 as the plane taking me to Wausau was delayed due to weather which I will say not entirely United's fault but some food and drink tokens would not of gone un-noticed. The flight home was all on time and everything went as planned. Thank you United you have impressed me I will be flying this airline again.",7us-airways,15/08/14,"Business class BWI with transfer in Charlotte - LAX. First time I flew US Airways. On board service is ok but would not pay for business class again. It is overpriced for the slightly larger seat. Food is ok. The real problem came when we arrived at 22.00 at LAX. We were off loaded and waited by the baggage claim. Luggage did not arrive until about 30-40 mins later. That would not be a big problem. The problem came when about 10 of us did not receive our luggage. The luggage belt kept going but after about an hour it became obvious nothing else was going to come. I headed over to the luggage office and to my surprise the luggage was lined up to the other side by the entrance to the airport - you could have literally walked from outside make two steps take my luggage and leave and no one not even cameras would see you come in. I approached the staff and raised my concern plus why did my suitcase not come the normal way. She proceeded to tell me it came on earlier flight. After asking why would they not inform us via PA system - she advised me there was no PA system they could use. I asked why could she not make the 1 min. trip and let us know and save us time and concern. She said ""not my problem"".",3us-airways,15/08/14,"Manchester - Orlando via Philly Orlando - Manchester via Charlotte. Outbound flight was ok on airbus A330 but food was terrible. The real fun began on the return flight. Having checked in (self service next to the desk) we discovered that although I had booked 3 seats together US Airways had decided to seat me away from my wife and young daughter). When I asked the attendant if he could change my seat to where I booked next to my family he replied ""oh but yours is a nice seat"". I replied ""ok but I want to sit with my family as I had booked so can you please arrange it"" to which he replied ""oh but yours is a nice seat"". Eventually he said ""sorry I cannot do anything you will have to ask them in Charlotte"". Eventually the lady at the gate managed to change my seat for me for the 1st flight but couldn't for the 2nd one and I would have to change it in Charlotte. Luckily the lady at the gate was sympathetic to my request and seated us all together for the Manchester flight. On boarding the flight (a 757 Aircraft) it was a very outdated plane for a transatlantic flight! The TV screens were down the aisles not in the back of the seats and worse still the one at the back where we were seated did not work for the entire flight. Again the food was very poor for the main meal but that was nothing compared to breakfast! This consisted of a single warm small muffin/cake and a cup of coffee or tea. When I asked where the breakfast was they replied ""that's it"". If I had to rate this airline I would give it a 1 out of 10 at the very most. I will not be using US Airlines again for travelling to the USA anytime soon.",2united-airlines,17/07/14,I travelled business class from Taipei to Boston via San Francisco. The appetizer had unidentifiable meat on it that was so leathery I couldn't even chew it. The roll was as hard as a rock. The toddler in a seat near me made a lot of noise. I usually travel economy and tolerate all of this. When you pay for business class you shouldn't have to tolerate any of this. I arrived in San Francisco and there is a four hour delay on my flight to Boston due to an engine failure on the plane originating in Washington D.C. So I got on an earlier flight but have to travel economy class. I asked the agent to if she could help reimburse me for the difference between economy and business. She said I have to do it by myself online. Hassle after hassle after hassle.,5united-airlines,17/07/14,"I was on a flight to San Francisco traveling via Washington D.C. All passengers boarded the plane and everything seemed normal. We didn't take off for a few minutes but I assumed that a few minutes delay was normal. The captain walked in next and announced that the ""tyre pressure was low"". After some conversation with the maintenance crew at the airport the captain announced that they will have to deplane us. My thoughts at that point were - why wasn't it looked at before the previous crew left the aircraft? Or afterwards? They kept intermittently announcing that the flight would take off now and then and so on. But eventually 6 hours after we first boarded the plane the flight was cancelled. The crew expressed helplessness - we can't blame them. The airline staff were also helpful in rebooking but it was a lesson - a significant one in my life and I'll certainly think a hundred times before choosing United again.",3us-airways,15/08/14,August 13 2014. YEG to PHX flight booked for 6.20am departure. They do pre-board announcement about 6.00 but then immediately tell everyone to sit down and relax because crew not there yet. Then departure pushed back to 7.00am. No updates given and an hour later departure pushed back to 9.00am. Then 10.00am and now announce they will start trying to move people to other flights because still no idea when crew will arrive. Line up for 1/2 hour only to get to front and be told they are only re-accommodating people with connecting flights and since my final destination is PHX I have to wait because the plane will still be going which I know by past experience with US Airways is unlikely. Then departure pushed back to 11 and a while later to 12pm when they finally mark it cancelled. So 2 hours in line now to get re-accommodated. By this time all other options for the day are full best they can do is 2 days later! Rebook on another airline for next day. Never given explanation nor apology they seem to delay cancellations as long as possible so people find other flights on their own and then don't need to give any compensation because flight not cancelled. Terrible airline avoid at all costs.,united-airlines,17/07/14,"Airline staff (only one) never smiled and I mean never smiled even when I was pleasant to them when purchasing drinks the stewardess couldn't find what we wanted we had to point them out to her and she made a comment after buying 3 drinks if we were going to ""buy the entire cart"" and she wasn't being funny. We had to ask one of them could they collect trash after eating and he grunted and went off to get a bag and when we said thanks he just glared at us. We felt like cattle first you eat then you buy drinks and then don't annoy us. It was a long night from Newark to Belfast and was very glad to get off that flight.",5united-airlines,17/07/14,I was booked on another flight after my original flight was cancelled due to Hurricane Arthur. I decided to check- in for this flight as I would have to get up at 5am to catch it. At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight. When my flight 5876 was cancelled on 3 Jul 14 there were 2 staff members to re-schedule over 50 people - it takes about 45 minutes for the staff to re-schedule each person. How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA. Flights cancelled 3 times in the last 3 weeks and no-one told me. They have all my contact information and send me my boarding passes and tickets but won't tell me when a flight is cancelled.,2us-airways,15/08/14,We were due to fly Dublin - Charlotte - Orlando on 25th July. When we got to the airport our flight to Charlotte was delayed by 4 hours. Went to US Airways desk to mention we would miss our connection she was so helpful and got us to Gatwick with Aer Lingus and onto Orlando with British Airways. Returning home on 8th Aug and we had no problems Orlando to Charlotte on American Airlines and US Airways to Dublin. Having heard all the horrid reviews I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I found US Airways flight attendants so nice and the flight was lovely.,9us-airways,15/08/14,I flew from New York to Honolulu for my brother-in-law's wedding. My first flight was delayed first because the toilet was clogged then because the breaks didn't work. The pilot made a nonchalant announcement 45 mins after we were stuck on the plane explaining the situation at last. We were delayed by 1.5 hrs and I missed my second flight from Phoenix to Honolulu. After speaking to many US Airways personnel who could not care less about me I managed to be rerouted through LA - that flight was also delayed by 1 hour due to an unexplained maintenance issue I was stuck in LA for a night - they did not help me find a hotel even though I practically begged them let alone pay for it. They didn't know where my luggage was. I took an American flight the next morning to HNL finding that my luggage was lost. It was found later in the day thanks to the AA staff at HNL airport. No US Airways personnel apologized offered to help or bothered to do their job. On the contrary they were rude non-caring and certainly not sympathetic. Overall a terrible experience.,united-airlines,17/07/14,I was on my way to Houston at McAllen airport and for almost 12 hours they kept postponing the flight every 30-90 minutes until finally cancelling one of the flights after about 6 hours but letting us know that we could go on a flight that again was postponed several times for about 5 hours until they finally cancelled the flight. Bottom line they kept me in a small airport from almost 9am until 9pm and then no flight. I've heard similar problems with this airline. Seems the service offered by this airline has declined tremendously since the merger (Continental + United). Very unreliable and I definitely try to avoid using this airline at least until there is significant improvement in service.,1united-airlines,13/07/14,I flew several internal US flights with my family May 2014. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of seating and the service. United is absolutely a cheap airline operating cattle trucks in the sky. The cabins are rammed full with very little space the seating is dreadful the customer service a joke and the mighty dollar king. I am only surprised the toilets were not charged for. The baggage handling was terrible. It is truly amazing that this airline has gone so far downhill.,1us-airways,07/08/14,We just flew back from vacation connected in Charlotte on our way back to Cincinnati. We get to our gate only to be told there was a gate change from E3 to E 38. Meanwhile we hear several announcements of delays and gate changes due to maintenance. We finally get to the gate and our plane left 40 minutes late - while the flight board displays the flight leaving at the original time. Once we get on the plane we inched along the runway for another 45 minutes before the pilot finally gave us an update. Meanwhile the flight attendant was welcoming us aboard US Airways Express - express really. She proceeds to tell us that we must pay for snacks ranging from $3.50 to $7.00 for wine and beer. This is the third bad experience we have had with US Airways in the 3 times we have flown them. I am done!,2us-airways,07/08/14,Our opinion of US Airways is that their customer service is poor and their organisation falls apart when planes are cancelled. On our flight out US 722 from Dublin to Philadelphia the attitude of the US Airways Dublin check- in staff was somewhat aloof. The flight attendants were grumpy and did not appear to want to be doing their jobs. Our return flight from Philadelphia to Dublin went well until the captain ineptly described that they had a fault with the GPS and navigation systems in that they did not agree. However he described we would be OK as we were still over land and this would aid them to guide the plane back to Philadelphia. After 3 hours we were diverted to Philadelphia where we found that US Airways lacked in all areas of how to deal with this event. On landing the cabin crew simply said proceed to baggage terminal C where you will be accommodated. On arrival in Terminal C no clear instructions were given as to why to do next and there was no US Airways staff present who could organise the skeleton staff to help with everyone finding alternative flights. One staff member wandered around with a business card saying that you could go to the ticket desk or ring a number to make arrangements for other flights. However not everyone got this card and we had to help some families who were not made aware of this. After 3 hours of telephone calls and waiting in a queue US Airways did find us alternative flights and accommodation which was positive. However the staff guiding us in the queues were extremely rude and the US Airways staff member aiding families in the taxi rank to get taxis was completely out of her depth in this job. At one point there were about 30 of us queuing with a line a taxis waiting and a major argument between taxi drivers and staff. I honestly thought a few of the female passengers were going to break down in tears. Essentially our disappointment is not with the mechanical failure of the plane but in the very poor attitude of the US Airway staff and extremely poor leadership and organisation as soon we were left to our devices once the plane was returned to Philadelphia airport.,united-airlines,13/07/14,MUC-EWR in Economy Plus. The EC cabin was probably less than half full which made things more comfortable but that didn't seem to affect the overall poor service. Most flight attendants perfunctory with their work (with one exception) and attitudes were poor. Food given to us as if we were a million-man army and the quality continues to decline. Few water runs. On the upside the movie selection was excellent but I have never seen a worse cabin crew ever.,5us-airways,07/08/14,Tried to fly from Philadelphia to Bangor on 2 August. Waited over two hours for them to fix plane. They even boarded us and we taxied out to take off but they found yet another mechanical fault while we were on the runway. Returned and disembarked. Very rude ground crew. Flight then cancelled. Had to wait in a long line to be put on a new flight. Cabin crew from other flights dame and pushed in at the top of the line making our wait even longer! Could not believe how rude they were. Even though Philadelphia is a hub for them and the flight was fully booked they could not find an alternative aircraft. And lots seemed to be sitting around going nowhere. We took a flight to Boston. Very rude woman at the gate looked at my BA Silver card and yelled - You are not preferred customers! She did not even know who US Airways partner airlines are. We arrived in Boston on a plane with broken toilets. None working in Economy. There is always something broken on a US Airways plane. Our bags were sent to Bagnor. So we had to spend a night sleeping in our clothes and then drive out of our way to Bangor airport to collect them next day. I have never had a flight with this airline where the plane took off on time and everything on board worked. Many flights were cancelled. Even long distance ones from London. I will go out of my to never travel with this airline again.,us-airways,07/08/14,"The weather was clear on July 4 2014. In fact US Air flight next to us was leaving for Los Angeles without any delay. Our flight (#1836) was cancelled due to ""crew unavailable"" and not due to weather. The ""crew unavailable"" referred only to the pilot. The flight attendants for this flight were all there ready at the door waiting to board. Before the flight was cancelled the announcement stated that we were ""just waiting for the pilot"". US air claimed that this could be due to a domino effect of an inbound flight not arriving on time. I would agree with them that it would be difficult to find a whole flight crews but in this case we were only waiting for the pilot. This situation was not due to an unforeseen circumstance yet they blame the weather for their mismanagement. They should have a stand by pilot for this situation. I consider myself a seasoned traveler and this is not my first time encountering flight delay or cancellation. Other airlines had not only provided me with an overnight stay at a nearby hotel but also had a bus ready to shuttle all the passenger to the hotel and provided us with an overnight kit. You have a choice you don't have to put up with US air mismanagement and constant delay.",1united-airlines,13/07/14,On July 1 2014 my family and I were traveling to the Cayman Islands flight was cancelled 1 hr prior to our departure time due to bad weather in Houston. They tried to reschedule our flight for two days later we could not go two days later we had to return to work in a certain amount of time. Once we were on a flight that day the flight attendant reported to us that there was no bad weather and had no idea why our flight was cancelled. We were then sent to Houston airport where they got us on a flight to fly into Miami where our next flight could not leave until the next morning so we spent the night on the floor at the Miami airport. The experience to our destination was horrible flying United and their express flights. Once we were returning home on United they did not tell us we did not have to pay for our luggage again and let us pay again Once again the flight was unpleasant. Once we arrived into Houston our flight home was delayed again the experience with United Airlines was horrible and the flight attendants were very unfriendly. I will never fly United again.,1us-airways,07/08/14,"I flew from Chicago to Philadelphia to Tel Aviv and back the same way. Overall this was a great experience. Checking in was quick and punctual even with Israel's necessary added security. Flights left in a timely fashion. Flight attendants were nice enough. On the 12.5 hr flight back from Tel Aviv we received 2 meals that were surprisingly good plus they came around with free beverages 3 times plus made regular trash runs. Inflight entertainment system also allowed you to see your trip progress though you had to push a little hard to select things. If that's your only complaint it's a good entertainment system. The Airbus A330-200s were smooth and quiet as were the A320-200s. My only complaint was the difficulty sleeping/seat comfort but I'm 6'7"" so it was expected. It was the most comfortable flight I've been on. Overall it was a great experience and I'd gladly fly with US Airways again as long as the prices remain competitive. In everything that's actually consistent and important US Airways surpassed expectations.",10united-airlines,13/07/14,I flew United 148 Newark to Geneva economy July 8. After reading other reviews I was prepared to expect less but was pleasantly surprised. The stewards and stewardesses were prompt with service and very friendly. Seat-back inflight entertainment provided me with many options to kill the 7.5 hour flight. The meal was good for an airplane meal and they were generous with drinks making numerous coffee/soda/water runs. The flight wasn't full and I was able to actually sleep on an international flight which made me happy since I had no one sitting next to me. We left Newark on time and arrived in Geneva on time. They got me there safely and cheerfully. What else can I ask for?,10united-airlines,13/07/14,"Like many people I flew United because of the great service I used to receive when Continental was still around. After the merger United seems to actually try to become the worst airline in United States history! On my last 4 trips United was responsible for 6 flights. Out of the 6 5 had major issues. The first trip had two legs. The first flight was delayed 1.5 hrs because the pilots couldn't show up on time. That caused me to miss my connecting flight by 3 minutes. Because the connecting flight was missed they booked me on the next flight (after an hour wait in the Customer Service line at O'Hare). Well the next flight was delayed nearly 3 hours - 1.5 of which was on the tarmac! On the return trip I checked in to my LAX-ORD flight only to find out my seat had been canceled. After arguing with the ticket counter agent that I indeed paid to be on the flight they finally called their reservations department. They in turn told me that I cancelled the flight. After more arguing they finally conceded that my seat may have been ""accidentally canceled"" by the ORD customer service. Finally on my last connection from ORD-ATW I sat around for over 5 hours because the aircraft that was supposed to take the route was late coming in. Really? It's Chicago O'Hare airport United's biggest hub! They couldn't pull another ERJ-145 into service? I could have driven to ATW and back (probably should have) in the amount of time I waited for the delayed aircraft. Despite having been a loyal Continental customer for over a decade I will not be flying United again in my lifetime.",1us-airways,07/08/14,"I flew from Las Vegas to Salisbury (Maryland). It was supposed to be a quick weekend trip. All I had was a small carry on and personal bag. They ran out of over head room and I had to check my suitcase in. I figured I would get it back once I reached Philly for my layover. They actually checked it in. Did not bother to tell anyone this. To make matters worse my connecting flight was delayed. Overall flight going was bearable despite the inconveniences. Returning however a whole other story. I arrived at the tiny airport an hour before the security check point was open. After getting through security with the 30 other passengers we waited about 20 minutes extra. We all board in an efficient manner. About 1/2 of us had to check in our small pieces of luggage because the plane was too small for it to be true carry on. So we board and are ready to take off. The pilot arrived we waited 15 minutes before taking off. I have 64 minutes of a layover. We get near philly and have to circle around then land. After landing we sit on the tarmac for 5 minutes in 2 different spots. I have less than 15 minutes to get to my gate. We deplane and wait for the ground crew to unload the ""carry on"" luggage. They move with no purpose. Most of the fight has less than 20 minutes to catch their next flight. I get my bag. No fault to the airline but my connecting flight is out of a different gate and I have to take a shuttle there. This trip takes about 7 minutes. I see my plane at the gate. By the time I got to the gate the plane was pulling away. After all of this the next day my flight took off about 45 minutes behind schedule. I had a horrible experience all around nor did the airline seem to b remorseful for the 12 hour inconvenience.",united-airlines,13/07/14,The wife and I purchased a last minute Vegas package deal in June through Priceline. We got a non-stop round trip flight with United. We have flown with them before and never had any problems. Unfortunately there was a death in the family and we had to change our departure date. I was not sure if we were locked into our package itinerary and would have to buy new tickets to get home so I called United's Customer Service. I advised them of our situation and the need to go home. There staff told me not to worry and assured me they would get us back in time for the funeral. They arranged a non-stop flight for us to get home with no extra fees. There courteous and swift service was greatly appreciated.,10united-airlines,13/07/14,Flew from SLC to DFW with my two toddlers. Our first flight from SLC-Houston was delayed about 40 minutes which gave me 20 minutes to get on my flight in Houston to DFW. I gate checked my stroller so I could use it to get from one flight to the next. After our flight I waited for the stroller and it never came. A baggage worker approached me and told me that he couldn't bring my stroller up because it had a white tag when it needed the pink tag. I told him that I needed to get to a flight that was leaving in 20 minutes. He was nice and offered to get the stroller onto my next flight. I trusted he would and ran to our next flight dragging my two screaming kids with me. We barely made it before it took off. When we landed in DFW I again waited at the gate for my stroller. It never came. I again dragged my two toddlers across the airport to baggage claim. The stroller still wasn't there. I eventually found the stroller without anyone's help. I will not fly United again.,1us-airways,07/08/14,US0785 and US2888. 28th July 2014. Edinburgh to Philadelphia / Philadelphia to Cleveland. What a terrible airline. The staff are ignorant and unfriendly the aeroplanes are old and dated looking. I used this airline via 4 separate flights within 1 week and I will never do it again! Even the US Airways ground staff were ignorant and unhelpful. I missed my connecting flight due to standing at Customs (Philly) for 2 hrs and the plane was still at the gate when I finally arrived. However they then told us that the flight was oversold anyway! Then shoved onto standby for the next 2 flights only to be told that they were full and to come back the next morning. The staff were hopeless! I had to pay for my own hotel room and not even so much as a sorry!,united-airlines,08/07/14,Our flight from Anchorage was to depart around 8.35 or so but delayed 2 hours due to electrical issues. Repairs made and flight was smooth and safe. But this put many people into flux because of missed connections. Houston airport was a total mess with people milling around and scrambling for standby options. We had a package of frozen fish we did not care to lose. We would approach the podiums for standby only to be advised the flight was already overbooked. On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees. Some were very nice and helpful but many but totally burned out and fighting with each other. This is a nasty situation and I encourage another airline at the moment.,5united-airlines,08/07/14,On the way to our destination they wouldn't accommodate my family (5) since we missed our connecting flight due to a delay on their part. It took us over 24 hours to reach the east coast which normally takes 6 hours flying. On the way back they gave away my paid for ticket that I purchased 2 months in advanced to someone who bought it 2 hours before. They re-booked me on the same flight with my family and only to find out once I boarded it was double booked. They also misplaced our luggage and left it in Newark New Jersey when we live in California.,4us-airways,07/08/14,The plane bound from Athens Greece to Philadelphia Pennsylvania broke down and we waited in the plane for an hour and a half. In Philadelphia I went through customs like clock work. I dropped my baggage off for my connecting flight to Chicago and here is where the problems started. My baggage got on another flight and not with mine. At Chicago I rushed to get the baggage so I could catch the next coach to my final destination of South Bend IN regional airport where I was to pick up a rental car. This was not the case. Ground staff of US Airways gave me the run around for two hours plus. Finally consulting with the ground security I asked kindly if the staff could check their computer and locate my baggage. The ground staff told me my baggage would arrive after 9pm by which time I would have lost the last coach to Indiana. I told them to forward my baggage to my motel the next day. My baggage came after three days and a long struggle.,1us-airways,03/08/14,US Airways 502 and 1836 on July 21st 2014. Having read the reviews on this site I became quite nervous about flying with US Airways! What were they going to do to me? To my luggage? What lies would they make up? So happy to say I had a completely non-eventful perfectly normal flight with pleasant flight attendants punctual timing useful information and all my baggage arriving on time and in good condition. Better legroom than some airlines I've been on. Helpful friendly people all through. Twice we were served beverages - no food so that might be my only gripe but it's a small one really. I think it's important to write a review even when things go well to counteract all the bad ones on here. Flight from Mexico City to Las Vegas via Phoenix.,9us-airways,31/07/14,BWI to CLT. Gate agents and flight crew provided conflicting information to passengers causing unnecessary confusion on multiple accounts and required zone 5 boarding passengers to gate check carry-on bags containing electronics when ample overhead bin space was indeed available. As a frequent flyer I have watched as this carrier has gone way downhill since the unfortunate merger with American. I hope to be able to avoid them as much as possible in the future.,1united-airlines,06/07/14,United's poor handling of airline operations and poor customer service led to two cancelled flights and nine hour in the airport on June 30 (ending on July 1 at 3.30am) for my originally scheduled flight #518 from Chicago ORD to Portland OR (PDX). After arriving 3 hours late into ORD on a flight from Munich because of an unscheduled stop in Boston to change pilots I arrived to find flight #518 from ORD to PDX delayed because of a maintenance issue. After three delays two gate changes and three hours the flight was cancelled. I was reassigned to Flight #627 scheduled to depart at 8.25pm. If my original flight had left on time I would have missed the weather delay that started at about 7pm and lasted for an hour or so. The weather delay did mess things up and flights were diverted to wait for the weather to pass. Our incoming plane was diverted to Rockford IL for a ground stop and then never made it to Chicago. We had 7 official delays several noted only after the original delay deadline had passed and then the delay was only another 30 to 45 minutes so not much time to go get food etc. We had 3 gate changes during the process the last of which brought us back to the gate where our plane for Flight #518 was still sitting still with its mechanical problems. Our inbound aircraft never made it no alternative aircraft could be brought to the gate even though there was an alternate aircraft available and the flight crew timed out at just before 2am when they cancelled the flight. They offered a hotel voucher but the closest hotel was 20 miles away. After 26 hours travelling the last nine being at ORD I left for a hotel I had to pay for an hour away in downtown Chicago. Very poor customer service.,1us-airways,31/07/14,IAH to BWI - 7/26/14. I was forced to check-in my small carry-on bag at the gate. I am allowed to carry a personal item and a small carry-on bag and I had packed accordingly. I had my important financial documents and laptop in my carry-on. The agents at the gate were very rude and inflexible and I was forced to take out my laptop and the binder full of financial documents and carry them on the plane and they checked-in my almost empty suitcase! To make matters worse I got on the plane and discovered that the overhead bins all around my seat were empty. I have been flying for a long time and this has never happened with any other airline. I did not appreciate being forced into a situation with no options and being told by the agent at the gate to look for another flight if I did not check-in my bag. The staff need training in customer service. If my ticket states I am allowed to carry a small carry-on bag into the plane and there is room on the plane then there is no reason to be forced to check my bag. Incidentally this is the second time I had a bad experience with US Airways. A few years ago another rude gate agent yelled at me for carrying a bag for my husband who was on crutches! The agent insisted that my husband had to carry his own bag even though he is on crutches. Needless to say I will not be flying US Airways again.,1united-airlines,06/07/14,Worst travel experience ever. Travelling with two young kids not given seats together on flights from YVR to IAH and IAH to Tampa even after calling Customer Service before the flight. Flight to IAH was late resulting in missing connection to Tampa. Had to stay in IAH for 6 hours with two kids and Customer Service did not appear to care or want to help. UA has the worst customer service and do not listen to their customers.,1united-airlines,06/07/14,I flew UA Spokane WA to Denver CO and flight staff were late for work so slight delay. Plane was crowded but staff pleasant. Got to Denver landed at Gate B1 and had to run to Gate B95 because I had 5 mins to catch my next flight also UA. Finally got to my gate to find it was changed and there was a delay for half an hour. This turned into a two hour delay as they kept extending it. Plane was very crowded and tiny seats staff were friendly enough served cold coffee. I was lucky as everyone I sat with had a UA flying horror story. All in all it could have been worse. I thought staff being late was rather tacky. I think I will fly Delta next time.,3us-airways,31/07/14,July 4th 2014. Flight cancelled from PHX to FLL no reason given. We were there 3 hrs early after driving 2.5 hrs. Rescheduled to 1.30am PHX to Charlotte North Carolina. Plane left 1 hr late 1 flight steward for 1st class. I am disabled can't run for connecting flight from Gate A11 to B9 husband flags tram make flight to Miami with a minute to spare. Bags do not make flight. Get bags in FLL hotel at midnight.,3united-airlines,06/07/14,Our United flight DCA-ORD (direct) was cancelled and finally we arrived to Chicago 12 hours later flying via New York. Very bad information from staff. Only 4 days later another United flight from Chicago to Frankfurt was delayed more than 2 hours and we lose our flight connection to Barcelona. Entertainment and service on board was very poor. We've flown with many airlines from five continents and United is the worst in service. We cannot recommend this airline.,2us-airways,29/07/14,"My family and I flew from PHL to Rome Italy. Our 2 year old son has a severe peanut allergy. I called in advance to ask if I could board early to clean his seat and if they could make an announcement regarding the allergy. I do not expect anyone to change their eating habits we just wanted to make those immediately around us aware. I was told on the phone it is up to the individual crew the day of our flight. When we boarded the plane I asked a member of the crew. She said she would check. As I was seated a flight attendant came up to me and said in a condescending tone ""It is our policy that we do not make any exceptions for those with food allergies. We cannot guarantee anything and we do not make announcements. We do not serve peanuts but other people can eat what they want."" We just informed the people directly around us and they were more than understanding. The staff were just rude in general. My mother-in-law got up to get something that fell on the floor for my daughter. The flight attendant barked at her to move. She said ""Move we are coming through with the cart."" Where is common courtesy? When they came around with the beverage cart they merely said ""Drink""? At first we gave the airline the benefit of the doubt thinking it was only this crew. On our return to PHL the crew was worse. We didn't ask them to make an announcement as we knew the response would be the same. We did however inform the flight attendant of our son's allergy. During the flight I came out of the bathroom to notice that a woman was dipping her pretzels in peanut butter. I calmly asked the flight attendant if I could move away because of the peanut butter. She looked at me and said ""What do you want me to do""? I said ""I cannot stand here with him for long."" She scoffed and said facetiously to her partner "" We need to move because this kid has an allergy."" I should also note that the company said it does not serve peanuts or peanut products on the plane: however the pretzels handed to everyone were from ""King Nuts."" The package clearly stated that it may contain traces of peanuts and tree nuts. Clearly US Airways does not recognize the severity of the allergy.",united-airlines,06/07/14,UA 39 from OSL to EWR 23 June and UA 38 from EWR to OSL 29 June 2014. The plane was on route both directions (OSL-NYC return). The cabin staff made our flight very pleasant. Of course there is not much space in economy seat but it turned out to be manageable.,8united-airlines,06/07/14,We flew from Birmingham UK to Newark USA (Washington to Las Vegas San Francisco/Newark and then back to Birmingham middle of May and United were brilliant. Seats reserved as requested on all flights so no stress there. A bit more legroom would be good especially when passengers recline their seats usually not necessary. No delays all staff especially those on board very pleasant and most helpful on all flights. Food served was pretty good water offered throughout the various flights. All baggage looked after nothing lost or delayed. A good airline keep it up. [Unfortunately some passengers tend to disregard the comfort of passengers behind them backs of their seats reclined fully from the start and throughout the journey even though not sleeping but watching a movie or playing games].,10us-airways,27/07/14,June 21-22 2014 HNL-TPA by way of PHX. First Class. First leg fine nice crew comfy seat decent meal. Second leg - not so much! Almost 4 hour flight landing in TPA at 6.30 am - breakfast should have been served but all we got was a teeny bag of not very good pretzels. When questioned about this shabby treatment US customer relations (first time around) said that no meal should have been served. Upon a second communication they said sorry yes - breakfast should have been served. Their solution was to offer a small voucher (which expires in a year) toward a future US flight which is completely useless to me as my travel plans for the coming year are already in place. They feel this represents some kind of value and is acceptable as reparation for the shabby treatment. The seats were uncomfortable they had a built in pillow which prevents you from putting your head back. It is not removable. So if you book first class on US make sure you find out what you're paying for - you may not be getting much. They have lost this customer.,1united-airlines,06/07/14,Flight 63 July 4 2014. We had a full coach with no functioning bathrooms! I found out from one of the FA's that the flight came to Madrid from Washington with the forward bathroom already broken and the service crew didn't bother to fix it. Mid flight the second bathroom got irreparably jammed because of over use and lack of water. Of the last one soon followed. What sort of management runs a company like that. United will soon have the reputation that Aeroflot had back in the eighties. We will never travel with United again and that after twenty years of loyalty.,1united-airlines,06/07/14,I am a Premier Silver member on United. I am on the verge of switching airlines for future travel due to the horrible experience I'm having. I used miles to book a ticket from Sao Paulo to Chicago. They cancelled the flight (UAL 844) on July 1 (apparently weather in Chicago) again (UAL 844) on July 2 and automatically rebooked me on a flight on July 4 with a connection through Washington D.C. There has been zero communication from United except for an automatic rebooking email. Hundreds of travelers are now stranded at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Sao Paulo Brazil. I will be stranded in Sao Paulo for four extra days! I consistently attain Premier Silver status and always defend United when other customers complain of how bad an airline it is. Since I fly out of Chicago O'Hare I know I have other options in terms of airlines. I do not even know if I will make it out on July 4. The hotel we are at has provided no information to any of the customers in terms of what is the next step. As United increases capacity to try to build revenue they need to not forget about what matters the most: the customer. If this is not resolved to my satisfaction I will be taking my business to American Airlines (or elsewhere).,1us-airways,27/07/14,I purchased a flight with American Airline to fly from Miami to New Orleans on July 3-7. They changed my flight to US Air but didn't inform me until one week before flight. I paid for upgrade seats but it was not transferred over. Now what really bother me was my return trip home from New Orleans well I didn't get back until a day later. Both airlines seemed to simply want to place blame on each other when they should be working together on rescheduling flights when they cancel them. American whom I booked with originally were of absolutely no use to me once they changed me to a US Air flight. Though it took many back and forth trips between the two companies finally a supervisor with US Air provided me with some assistance in getting me booked on another flight to fly out a day later. It's ridiculous that it would take me 4 hours in the airport to get rescheduled when I checked in well in advance (4hours) after my flight was canceled. I should not have needed a supervisor to get my flight rescheduled all agents should be able to do it. I went through 5 agents between AA and US Air and none were helpful. When airlines join forces to become one company they should be operating as one not passing the buck and blame between each other.,1united-airlines,03/07/14,United Flight San Fran to Sydney due to depart at 10.20pm July 1st. Late away from the gates. Over 2 hours on the runway - a disruptive passenger means we have to return to the gate so that she can be removed by police. We are then told that we are not allowed to depart at all that evening and have to get off the plane. Went to customer service with all 350 other people. Queue to get a hotel voucher and new tickets for 25 hours later. Queue to get the shuttle. Finally in a hotel in the middle of nowhere at 3am. 25 hours of my life gone - disgraceful communication from United. Passenger was already behaving badly in the airport bar before departure.,1us-airways,27/07/14,"Flying out of Shannon Ireland we arrive at the airport to discover our flight to Philly has been cancelled. The flight was canceled the previous day. ""Mechanical issues"". At least we get a night in a hotel w/meals. The next day we get out of Ireland to Philly - board for next connection only to sit on tarmac. Pilot tells us there is bad weather in Charlotte. Once we take off pilot gets on intercom to ask flight crew to stay seated through the flight due to turbulence. In 1st class drinks and food being served throughout the flight no turbulence encountered. This is all suspicious to us as on our flight out of the U.S. we got delayed on the tarmac until the crew timed out thank goodness Delta helped us get us out! I think the canceled flight from Shannon was actually a case of USAir wanting to fly a fuller plane.",2us-airways,27/07/14,"I was taking two US Airways flights on my return trip from a cruise Miami to Charlotte (their hub) and then Charlotte to Dayton Ohio. I waited in Miami airport all afternoon for my evening flight and it wasn't until it was about boarding time that they updated the flight boards to show the plane was delayed. They started calling people up to try to get them on different flights but by that time it was too late for me to get on another good connecting flight. The gate agent couldn't find any other good connections except for the flight from Charlotte to Dayton that wouldn't leave again until the next morning. The Miami to Charlotte flight ended up being 1.5 hrs late due to mechanical issues. We quickly boarded as just about everyone had a connecting flight that night. Staff onboard were rude and terse with everybody. They could have at least given us some empathy and info on where to go inside their hub to get new connecting flights but they didn't. Once we finally landed and everybody got up to leave then they finally announced that all the connecting flights for the evening have already left. I got in line at their customer service desk and heard them repeating the same things like robots: ""no vouchers"" ""due to weather"" ""we can't help you."" Mind you we were told it was mechanical issues in Miami and now they were claiming it was the weather. I was lucky that I managed to get a hotel voucher after the lady next to me pressed the issue but I don't know if anyone else got one and made my way back to the airport in the morning. This whole ordeal taught me to never fly US Airways again and always pack enough stuff in your carry on to last a night in an airport if it ever gets delayed.",us-airways,27/07/14,Extremely dissatisfied with the lack of communication with US airways. Got to Charlotte for my flight to Nashville and the plane was delayed 30 minutes because we didn't have a pilot who could get here on time. The flight was delayed another 2 hours as the pilot who supposedly was supposed to be flying us the entire time was just now leaving Chicago to come and get us. Then the flight attendants left. We had no crew and pretty sure there was no pilot for this flight to begin with. Will never use this airline again.,us-airways,20/07/14,BOS to ONT with a tight Connection in PHX. Due to weather sat on the tarmac in Boston for an hour jeopardizing PHX connection. Flight crew announced that they know many passengers have connections in PHX so upon arrival please let these passengers out first. I ask the flight attendant if they have any specific info on the connector flights (no access to any information). We arrive at the gate the people get ready to run. Then they announce don't bother - all flights have left - go directly to the customer service area for instructions. I deplane check the board and see that my flight has also been delayed. I run and get to the gate just in time. I had upgraded to first class but they told me I lost my seat. They give me my new coach seat and I board. I was pleasantly surprised that my bag did make it on my plane.,4us-airways,17/07/14,I have never flown US Airways before and I never will again! Their customer service is well there is no customer service! We arrived to the airport after confirming that our flight was on time only to find that our flight was delayed 2 hours to Phoenix. It was supposed to be the first leg of our Anniversary trip to Puerto Vallarta Mexico. We finally got on the plane and of course our next flight out of Phoenix left without us. There were no planes to Puerto Vallarta that day. The agent gave us a number to call to get a hotel either for free or for a discount and neither were true. We spent the night in Phoenix when we should have been in Mexico. We upgraded to first class to make up for the disaster and made it to PV just fine. We thought that the return trip couldn't be bad but we pulled away from the terminal and sat on the runway for 30 minutes had to go back to the terminal and wait an additional 1.5 hrs on the plane before take off! The delay was blamed on communication / paperwork issues with the PV airport. No extra drinks. Meanwhile we had a connecting flight out of Phoenix and visions of the same thing happening all over again played in our heads. Luckily our connecting flight was delayed so as we reassess through immigration to customs to picking up our bags and running to the gate we made it home.,us-airways,17/07/14,I took USAir to Hawaii from St Louis and it was horrible. The planes are so small and I was so cramped. They didn't offer anything to eat on a 6 hour flight and when they did offer something to drink it was one time because they ran out of drinks. The staff was not any better they seemed to hate their jobs. Then the movie was the same going there and back and I could only see half the screen because the roof was in the way. The headphones didn't work well.,3us-airways,17/07/14,No entertainment on a 6 hour flight staff at PHL airport are rude and knowledgeable. The airplane looked like it was built in 1950 and the crew were so unhelpful and rude. we paid over $680pp for RT tickets to PHL from LAX. They told me they had no more food then I watched them serve food to a woman who asked 30 minutes later.,1us-airways,17/07/14,PHL-FLL in First booked with British Airways Avios miles. I had very low expectations for this flight but I was pleasantly surprised to find a friendly crew clean business class sized seats and priority treatment for my luggage upon our on-time arrival to FLL. Although no meal was offered FA's came around multiple times offering snacks and followed up with me throughout the flight on alcoholic drink refills. I'm not sure if this service is worth paying full price for as it does not come with lounge access and you have to pay for use of in-flight wifi which I think is inappropriate for a first-class experience. That being said the seats are much better that BA's Club Europe product where you are provided with the same seats as in economy but with the middle seat blocked off.,8us-airways,17/07/14,US Airways are inefficient and uncooperative. I left New Orleans at 9 am to insure that I would be in NYC in time for a Broadway show tonight. They canceled my connecting flight within thirty minutes of departure and they did not get me on a flight in time. They were not helpful in any way and their terminal was filthy.,1us-airways,17/07/14,FLL-PHL in economy. I flew down to FLL in first and had low expectations for economy but was once again pleasantly surprised. FA's well groomed and very polite clean cabin and restrooms throughout the flight and an on-time arrival despite numerous thunderstorms in our way. I hope this is the norm and not the exception and I hope that the merger with AA does not change things for the worse. All that being said it would have been nice to have some in-flight entertainment - none is provided on US Airways domestic.,8us-airways,13/07/14,6/24/14 on a round trip from Honolulu to Denver. I arrived at HNL airport before the recommended 2 hour time prior to take off. Upon my arrival I noticed that the plane was already at the gate. They loaded the first group of passengers and then the gate personnel said that there was a problem with the air conditioning so everyone had to deplane. This plane was at the gate for over 2 hours and no one noticed that the AC was out? We finally take off 1.5 hrs late. We arrived at Phoenix and I had to run to my next connection gate. I barely made my connection flight to Denver but my carry-on which I was told to check at the gate because there was no room on the plane did not make it. My return trip back to Honolulu was even worse. Again I got to the airport 2 hours prior to boarding. A plane was at the gate but the gate agent told me that it wasn't my flight. The gate agent assured me that this would be the gate for boarding. Half hour prior to boarding the gate agent tells everyone that we need to switch gates then we had to wait another half hour for another plane to taxi out of the gate. When my flight finally arrived at the gate it was discovered that one of the rear emergency masks was faulty. Again we have to wait. We are finally allowed to board on the plane a half hour after the scheduled boarding time to wait another two hours to take off. First the pilot says they have to refuel then we couldn't take off because of weather. This caused me to miss my connection flight to Honolulu from Phoenix. While I was waiting to take off I get an email from US Airways that due to the delay and me missing my connection flight I was being moved to another flight connecting from PHX to LAX and then to HNL but the flight wasn't until the next day and no mention of them paying for a place for me to stay. My wife was able to convince an agent to put me on an American Air flight that would get me back to Hawaii on that day. I will never fly US Airways again.,united-airlines,03/07/14,"I have been flying UAL for nearly 30 years now but I increasingly find them to be worse and worse. I have written to them twice now to protest their terrible baggage policies that encourage people to game the system and bring large heavy luggage to the gate so that they can get it on for free rather than paying for checking. This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger's backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured. Attendants told me they could not announce that passengers should be careful of other passengers when loading luggage because it would be a ""deviation from the script"" and get them in trouble. This is no longer an airline that I can say puts the client first.",1us-airways,08/07/14,My experience has been terrible and is yet to be over. My flight was cancelled due to weather which is not unreasonable. They (US Air customer service) set me up for a stand by flight the next day - I go to gate and even though I have a boarding pass they have no record of me so I am up to the bottom of the list and I did not get a seat - even though in discussing things with the other 3 stand by passengers I was in fact on stand by first. All three of them got a seat. Then they book me the next day to go to NY and take a Delta Connector. This time customer service does it wrong and I have no reservation on Delta and am now sitting in NY with no place to go. I am now 2 nights and 3 days into my delay. So they send me back to Philly from NY to get on an 8.40 flight that is oversold tonight. Who knows what will happen at 8.40!,united-airlines,03/07/14,My family and I flew United from Austin TX to Portland ME on June 30th. Or at least we tried to fly into Portland. We boarded our flight in Austin and arrived to Chicago with no problems. In Chicago we boarded our connecting flight but were told we were going to have to sit on the runway for a while because of the thunderstorms going on. About 30 minutes later we had to deplane for our safety. When we got off the plane we discovered numerous flights had been canceled due to weather. About 15 minutes later they got us back on the plane and told us we just had to fuel up and that they were going to get us to Portland that night. So then we waited out the weather for 6 hours and finally it was clear enough to take off at midnight. However one of the flight attendants timed out right when we were about to push back from the gate at midnight so they canceled it and told us to go wait in the customer service line to rebook. The line stretched over 10 gates and wasn't really helping any customers. Called customer service instead and was told there were no flights from Chicago to Portland until 3 days later and the best they could do for us was fly us to Hartford Connecticut - a 4 hour drive from Portland. Told our luggage would be sent to our destination Portland and would be waiting for us once we drove there. When we finally arrived in Portland at 6pm 24 hours after we were supposed to 3/4 bags hadn't even arrived. They have lost my family as customers.,2us-airways,06/07/14,"July 2 flight from Philadelphia to Detroit cancelled after it was boarded. We noticed it was half full. At first no reason given by the crew. Upon talking to the ticket agent the reason given was because of storms in the area. Funny thing my daughters flight same day same time to Washington DC heading straight into the east coast hurricane got off. We were only given a voucher for reduced hotel rate and told it was an ""act of God"". Will never fly US Airways again.",1united-airlines,03/07/14,"I switched from Southwest airlines 5-6 years ago. Logged around 180K miles since joining Continental/United. A while back I used most of my balance of miles to reward myself with a trip to Vegas for me and my wife. First Class there and coach back. Purchased at least a month in advance checked in the day before received tickets with our seat assignments while checking our bags. So far so good. At the gate they informed us that United overbooked First Class-still plenty of seats on plane-just overbooked First Class-not sure how you do that-since the odds of ""no shows"" happening with FC seats has to be rare. I understand overbooking the plane but not a section. We were told since we did not purchase the tickets with money we were the lucky losers. Someone gave up their seat which put my wife in first class and me in the back. Five years of loyalty resulted in a final reward of getting split up to start our vacation. The image of my wife crying at the gate will forever remind me of how United rewards their customers.",1us-airways,06/07/14,I've been flying for more than 24 years in and outside the United States. I have never flown US Airways before but did it because it's the only available flight for a last minute flight. My flight was 20 minute delayed from Portland our plane landed in Phoenix and had 20 mins to spare to get on my next flight to Milwaukee however I missed my connecting flight. The man next to me said he was there 15 minutes early and the door was already shut. US Airways knows when their plane touch down and no way they should shut the doors unless they oversold their tickets on a regular basis. I felt so bad for the staff that they have to go through all this chaos of passengers missing their connecting flights. This is absolutely the worst airline I've ever flown. They knew that they overbooked why would you close the door when you still have 15 minutes before the flight takes off. I feel bad for others who likes to fly cheap and they think they are getting a great deal.,us-airways,03/07/14,Something has happened to US Airways in the last couple of months that has affected the moral and attitude of staff. I make a three leg trip Manchester - Ohio - Florida - Manchester four times a year and have done for the last two or three years without issue until this last flight. 1) Baggage issues with the intermediate leg. US Airways computers do not register that the intermediate leg is part of a international journey and so flag up a checked baggage fee. Normally someone is on hand to over-rule the glitch and apply the correct code but this relies on the staff wanting to be helpful. I was treated outrageously by the so called supervisor in Cleveland last week and rather than argue the point any further i just paid and walked away so as not to cause delays to waiting passengers behind me. 2) The latest return leg to Manchester was the worst display of cabin crew attitude that I have ever experienced. Lying about a row of empty seats and saying they were empty for weight and balance issues when in fact they were subsequently used for the cabin crew to sleep on. Also to be refused a top up of wine with the meal (they were slow delivering the meal) but offering to sell me a $7 bottle instead was just pathetic. It was my intention to spend $200 or so on duty free gifts as I normally do but on this occasion - I decided not to.,2united-airlines,01/07/14,In the last month I and my family have flown United four times. Three of the four flights were unmitigated disasters causing terrible disruptions in our plans and incredible inconvenience. To make matters worse it seems as if United is totally focused on the passenger bearing all the downside to their poor execution. We got off a cancelled flight in Chicago ay 12.30 am and were greeted with nothing more than a toll free number to call for help. Not only the most pathetic customer service I've seen for an airline but the worst service I can recall for any business I've been associated with. I will fly United from now on only as a last resort.,1us-airways,03/07/14,My experience and that of numerous other passengers that I spoke with is that US Airways has an unacceptable rate of delays missed connecting flights and cancellations that is caused primarily by their failure to schedule appropriately. We had not mechanical issues or weather delays but our airplane left 25-30 minutes late from a small airport in Bangor Maine (i.e. not a lot of airport traffic either). I arrived at my connecting flight in Philadelphia to watch the doors close and the plane depart but absolutely no effort was made to have the plane wait an extra 5-10 minutes for the passengers that had just landed. In fact there wasn't even a US Airways representative at the gate to speak with. In addition if you miss a flight and have to stay overnight you should not expect any assistance from US Airways.,united-airlines,01/07/14,Flew UA1453 on June 29 2014 from Dulles to Seattle. Worst experience ever. Took 90 minutes to check bags. Flight left 3 hours late. Had to board twice. They had to reassign seats for four different families with little kids because they didn't get seated together when issued tickets. Had to unload because they had a flat tyre. Apparently they don't check things like that before loading planes. Watched Laurel and Hardy change the tyres. Missed my connecting flight in Seattle (of course).,1us-airways,01/07/14,My first flight was late. I ran across the airport to make my connection. They are supposed to close the gate ten minutes before and I made it with four minutes to spare. They had closed the door early and wouldn't let me through. There is nothing more frustrating than to watch people boarding the plane you are supposed to be on. The attendants were rude and no one wanted to help. There was a disabled lady who had also missed because she needed transportation help and they got her there late. No one would help her either which I thought was just wrong. The attendants couldn't have cared less. They wouldn't even acknowledge we were there. The other lady was stranded and couldn't even get anyone to call someone to come get her. I don't know maybe I was supposed to get mad and ugly but that has never been me and it shouldn't be necessary to get someone to show you courtesy.,3united-airlines,01/07/14,"Flight from New Orleans LA to Houston Texas delayed multiple times due to weather. Frequent gate changes plus delays required interaction with agents required to arrange connecting flights. 3 times waited in line for over an hour. One agent actually yelled at us about ""why didn't we all just call the reservations line?"" Which of course we were all trying to do but could not get through. I ended up spending the night at the Houston airport. I asked United personnel if I could get a blanket and pillow and was told they did not have any. However the next morning on another Untied concourse there were at least a dozen people on cots - with pillows and blankets! I also was unable to get anything to eat or drink as all of the businesses in the airport seemed to close at 10pm and we arrived at ~ 10.03. I am diabetic and have MS (had not eaten since 9am) and was unable to get any United personnel to help me out with this matter. I remain appalled at the lack of customer service and professionalism of United's staff.",1us-airways,01/07/14,"Flight after flight last night (26 June 14) late in the evening was being cancelled at Philadelphia all for ""mechanical reasons."" Are they having labor problems? US Airways counter staff unhelpful in getting me to RDU for important presentation Friday morning said there was no excess capacity and it could be up to a day before I got home. American Airlines Platinum desk was able to get me on an eatlier flight that had been delayed for so long for ""mechanical reasons"" that it was still in Philly. I got on and after another hour finally left. So my delay was cured by someone else's.",2us-airways,25/06/14,A most uncomfortable experience. Flew from Maui to Sky Harbor Phoenix. The crew cabin crew were inattentive and disinterested. For a five and a half hour flight thru the night they had one beverage run. Did not return after some 4 hours to offer even water. We traveled with two 13 year old granddaughters who were in a different part of the cabin. My wife attempted to alert a flight attendant that they were alone and to let us know if the needed anything and was bruskly brushed off. There was no announcement about the impending landing until the last moment. There was overall a very uncaring attitude which make me feel like a worthless commodity. I am an experienced traveler but this stands out as the worst flight I have experienced.,1united-airlines,01/07/14,June 25 2014 - flight delayed in Norfolk Virginia due to high winds at our destination. Not enough personnel to assist travelers at the counter. Computers were not operable. Attendant repeatedly assured us we were next in line but continued to help other people. After a 45 min wait another attendant arrived and made every effort to help but it was too late. Spent night at airport since local hotels were booked. Passengers were given a blanket and told to look for a place to sleep. Airport was extremely cold and loud music played all night. Witnessed the treatment from a United Supervisor towards a passenger at the Customer service counter - rude! Prior to this ordeal we attempted to change flight one day earlier but refused to pay the $200 - $300 per ticket. This was our second experience with United and were told that since they were purchased/merged with Continental the customer service has declined. Will try to avoid flying with them until this is corrected.,1us-airways,25/06/14,Flew from Manchester to Philadelphia - only direct flights there are. I think another time I'll go via Heathrow and travel BA where at least there will be some service. Cabin crew were slovenly and disinterested and spent most of the flight telling each other how tired they were and one chewed gum the entire journey. Food was disgusting and the entertainment consoles are a joke totally unresponsive and you nearly break a finger prodding at the screen to try and get it to do something. Dreadful.,1us-airways,23/06/14,"Flight 734 from Philadelphia to Manchester UK cancelled 40 mins before take-off due to ""maintenance"". Staff unhelpful one leaving customers to go home. Next days flights started with a two hour delay due to air-con problems. Inflight cabin crew surly and nearly threw food at us. No interaction with passengers. Cheap but not cheerful. Its the last time we will use US Airways. I'd rather pay a bit more to get a reliable and customer friendly service. In summary an awful experience.",1united-airlines,01/07/14,The trip from Little Rock to Moline was fairly uneventful except for a delay due to weather in Chicago. That is understandable. However the return trip from Moline to Little Rock was a complete disaster! Our flight from Moline to Chicago was delayed for crew time-out. Really? Our flight had been scheduled for over 2 months. Surely that is enough time to prepare for an available crew. Naturally even though we ran as fast as we could not easy for 60+ year old people we missed our connecting flight. Then we spent another 2 hours waiting in line to find another airline. Not allowed to mention lost luggage. Horrible experience.,1united-airlines,01/07/14,I flew San Francisco to Hong Kong and the old 747-400 didn't even have a good entertainment system. The audio outlets on the seats did not work the food was horrible! Alcoholic drinks are not free. On top of the $2000 USD fare that I am paying to fly economy I still have to pay $6 dollars for a beer. On top of that since I was coming from Bogota via Houston then to San Francisco when I arrived into Hong Kong my bag was not there! On my way back from Hong Kong to Newark and then to Bogota I happened to have the last row and the seats do not recline. On top of that I get to Bogota and my luggage was not there again.,1us-airways,23/06/14,After an 8 hour flight from Dublin we arrived in Charlotte just after noon we had an 8 hour layover in Charlotte until our final flight to Virginia I realized that then that there were seats available for an earlier flight to VA at 2.30 so I went to the customer service desk where no one was in line there were 3 US airways staff at the desk. The first of the 3 looked put off because I apparently interrupted her conversation with her co-workers. I asked her if I could the 2.30 flight and she informed me she could for a 75 dollar per person seat reservation. I gave in and paid and gave her our baggage tickets I asked her will our bags be there with us when we land? She said that by paying the 150$ our bags were guaranteed to be there when we land. We landed. No bags. So I went to the US Airways desk in Newport News where there were five other customers who had issues with bags we waited for over an hour while the front desk phone rang and rang and rang until finally someone came out. Only to be told that she didn't have the key to look in the lost baggage area she said she'd be right back (never came back). Finally someone came to help my bags never left Charlotte. I'll never fly US Airways again.,2us-airways,20/06/14,I had read horrible reviews about U.S Airways while planning my trip so I specifically went to American Airlines website paid $100 more for my tickets and booked my flight through American Airlines. I received all my email confirmations from American Airlines. When I arrived at the airport I went to American Airlines check in they tell me they don't have that flight. In very small print at the bottom of my confirmation it said U.S. Airways. I went over to the U.S. Airways check in counter to check my bag. I was flying with a firearm so they have to inspect it. My flight was set to leave at 7.45 am. While sitting at the gate waiting you could see they were working on our plane. Then came time to board and they told us it would be just a little while longer. They finally started boarding us at 8.00 am. At 9.00 we were still sitting on the runway waiting on mechanics at 9.30 they deboarded us from the plane and said it would be about 10.30 am before we departed. Sat at the gate area and at 11.30 they cancelled our flight. They gave everyone a card with a phone number to call to get on another flight. I called and got on an 8.45 pm flight that night. I sat at the airport for 16.5 hours waiting for the next flight to leave at 5.30 I got a phone call from U.S Airways saying the flight would be delayed until 9.30 pm. When I got to the gate it was pushed back to 9.50 pm. Finally after much hesitation I had to call and take myself off the flight and find my luggage. When I looked up that flight later it did not actually leave until 10.45 pm. When I went to go claim my luggage after about 30 minutes of not being able to locate it they discovered it was in Phoenix. It apparently made it on an earlier flight that it was not tagged for. I finally got it back at 8.30 pm the following evening.,united-airlines,01/07/14,June 27th 2014 - I usually avoid United because I have very rarely had a flight that wasn't delayed or cancelled outright with little to no notice. Today was no exception with a delay causing over a 90 minute delay. Nearly 25% of the other passengers on this flight were unable to get to connecting flights with this delay and were summarily told to pound salt when asked what United could/would do for them. Myself being only minorly inconvenienced could only hang my head in sympathy for passengers who would inevitably be left in Chicago O'Hare (also with it's share of issues) but when other passengers began comparing experiences on United they all agreed that this was relatively common regardless of destination. I cannot recommend United to anyone and suggest they actively avoid using this airline unless they absolutely don't need to get to their destination on time. Avoid using United Airlines unless you don't care about being on time or even arriving the same scheduled day. The fares are a poor bait and switch tactic and I would be surprised if the FAA does not step in soon.,1united-airlines,25/06/14,Flew IAH-DFW on June 11 as first leg to onward travel to Frankfurt on United Ticket but second leg operated on Lufthansa (business). Flight was delayed plane change and gate change. Had no access to United Club even with International Business Ticket in Houston. Reason was that my flights would have to be business all the way through final destination but E145 has no business. Barely made my connection in DFW. Reasons above are easy to fix but I guess not intended to. Why not make your customers happy. Work hard Fly right? Staff were nice and friendly and tried to make up for the delay and no access policy. Summary nice Staff but more and more 'unfriendly' policies.,3us-airways,16/06/14,Some friends and I booked flights from Nashville to St. Thomas. From there we were to take a cab to a ferry to Marina Cay. Lo and behold our flight was delayed due to maintenance. This caused us to miss the last ferry out resulting in a hotel stay in St. Thomas. As if that were not bad enough. one week later on our way back to the US we arrived at the St. Thomas airport three hours early for our flight. None of the kiosks worked to check in and there wasn't a single employee working. Luckily we had so much time. The passengers flying out on an earlier flight had experienced much worse panic when they were unable to check in to their flight that was leaving in less than an hour. Once all eight employees arrived at the same exact time we waited in a ridiculous long line of frustrated people. Happy to finally get to our gate we learned that our flight was delayed due to maintenance again!,1united-airlines,25/06/14,A very old 737-700 was used on this 5-hour flight from Washington D.C. To Vancouver. The first class seat although spacious is very drab. The whole cabin has a very utilitarian design with nothing that says flying with United is an exciting experience. I have to say though that elements of the experience have improved over the last few years. A cloth hot towel has been re-introduced and even though they ran our of food items in the first class cabin the breakfast selection was good. Besides a scrambled eggs option they had a healthy oat bran choice as well that I really enjoyed. Moreover they also came by during the flight with a fruit basket. Great to see healthy food options being provided. Reminder: don't sit in the last row of the cabin like I did as the seat doesn't fully recline back.,7us-airways,16/06/14,Airplane itself seemed newer than the planes I have been on in the past (I usually fly Delta). But after a 10 hour flight from Rome to Charlotte we arrive to find out flight to Tallahassee was cancelled. The customer service person was polite but kept getting distracted as she rebooked us on a Delta flight to get us home 4 hours later than originally planned. Our luggage made it the next day. I started researching and find out that cancelled flights are a frequent problem on US Airways. Don't fly them if you want to get where you are going on time!,3united-airlines,25/06/14,Flew PEK-ORD (flight 850) and ORD-MSP (flight 597) on Monday June 23. United often gets a bad reputation but overall I was very happy with my flights. Flight 850 left on time and arrived early in Chicago. The plane was clean the in-flight entertainment had a great selection of movies and TV shows and the crew were very friendly and helpful. The only problem I have with United's international flights is the lack of free beer and wine in Economy Class. Flight 597 to MSP boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes before we were given clearance to leave. Once we did finally take off the rest of the flight was fine. I'm a very happy United customer and would recommend this airline to anyone. While United's CEO is trying to cut costs and is devaluing the airline the flight crew and gate agents still work hard to give customers a great flying experience.,8united-airlines,25/06/14,Flew UA 319 Global First last night connecting from Austrian Airlines and was looking forward to experiencing UA's Global First on their three class 777 as I rarely ever fly UA. Horrible experience. Started with denying us access to the Global First Lounge as we were on Aeroplan miles even though their website says flying in Global First grants access to the lounge. They sent us three rail stops away to the Lufthansa Business Lounge so we could shower after the 10 hour+ flight from Vienna. The Gate Area was a mess with over 300 people crammed into a small area lining up like cattle in divided rows for 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 lanes - worse then Southwest. The plane came in late. We had to move to another Gate Area from C12 to D3 for another aircraft. The second Gate Area was larger. After a 1 hour and 38 minute delay we took off. Despite only 8 seats in Global First they don't get to board first. You must wait in Lane 1. Seems like an odd policy. The seats and cabin are very nice no complaints. The video/audio choices extensive except the screen is a little small compared to other carriers. For a transcon the drink/meal service stunk. The flight attendants were pleasant but UA offers no menus no champagne a tiny nut dish of peanuts and almonds limited food choices (chicken or pasta) all served at once on a plastic tray. The quality of food was poor. The sundae was very nice. Now I understand why United is having such a difficult time. They need to check out what other US carriers are doing.,2us-airways,10/06/14,US Airways now stoops to lying. Boarding my flight today I had to sit through the usual nonsense announcements that the flight is fully booked and overhead luggage storage is limited so customers should come up to the podium to check their bags. In the past I have ignored these pleas and I have not had a problem. I never check my baggage if I can help it because the best case is that you waste 30 to 45 minutes at your destination waiting for your bags to come down the carrousel. Worst case the airline loses your baggage or locks it up and leaves for the day because you make the mistake of going to the washroom before going to the carrousel. Today US Airways didn't achieve their quota of checked baggage so they decided to step it up a notch and report that one passenger has already come to the front of the airplane to check his baggage because the overhead storage is completely full so I dutifully went to the podium to check my bag. What do I find when I board the plane? Lots of available overhead storage. I am completely incensed at this behaviour and will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.,united-airlines,25/06/14,"Flew from Hong Kong to San Fran and around the US in late May. I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a lowâ€™ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since. Your people are your business.",1us-airways,08/06/14,We flew Houston-Charlotte-Lisbon (5/24/14). Flight 760 over wasn't too bad food was ok for coach. It was booked for us by Road Scholar as part of our travel package. I didn't have high expectations but it wasn't bad for being economy. The return US 761 (6/2/14) was the trip from hell starting with the oldest 757 I've ever flown. Late leaving Lisbon stupidest security personnel ever encountered. The front economy toilet had been repaired with putty glue you name it didn't work properly. Crew just plain didn't give a flip about passengers or service on board. Luckily both flights were about 50-60% full so you could stretch out. I will avoid this airline like the plague and any variation the merger with AA cooks up - even if I pay extra.,united-airlines,25/06/14,We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.,1united-airlines,23/06/14,In a recent long-haul flight (UA871) SFO-TPE business class again ran out of the Asian meal option. This occurred in 4 out of my 5 recent transpacific flights. The purser came and apologized. She said United loaded only four such meals into a business class that seats 44 passengers! With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration? It's pretty bad given that for the same fare one can fly in a much more spacious environment on competing airlines. I wish United would dismantle these terrible seats.,4us-airways,05/06/14,Manchester UK - Philadelphia - New York. Totally satisfied great food modern inflight entertainment crew was nice flight delayed by 90 mins - did not bother me. People at the desk in Philadelphia very helpful. Was worried about this trip after reading only negative reviews but I must say I was very pleased. I fly the US - EU route every month (always a different airline though). I would definitely recommend US Airways.,9united-airlines,23/06/14,"DEN to ORD on a new (or with a new interior) A-320 and was very disappointed. UA has removed the entertainment system on this new plane both audio and video so if you like listening to ""From the Cockpit"" you are out of luck. Not everyone is always traveling with a laptop so on long flights the absence of entertainment will be very noticeable. The top of the slimline seat in front of me felt like it was right in front of my face and the new skinny armrests were very short and uncomfortable. The A-320 used to be my favorite plane on UA but if this is a sign of things to come it won't be any longer.",4united-airlines,23/06/14,"My flight out from SFO was overbooked by 4 and there were some ""hold your breath"" moments until 4 people decided to give up their tickets and take an alternate flight. I had a connecting flight in Denver to Lincoln Nebraska. Fortunately I had a 3 hour layover in Denver which gave me plenty of time to walk from one end of the airport to the other for a connecting flight and believe me when I say it is a long haul. If anyone has a short time span to get to a connecting flight I suggest they arrange for a cart. Passenger space on United is cramped. I sat beside a big guy and had to lean well over into the aisle in order for both of us to be able to sit in the side by side seats. My return from Lincoln to SFO was a nightmare. I arrived in Lincoln got my boarding pass and when I looked at the pass and compared the time on it to the departure time listed on the board I noticed that departure was at least one hour later - which meant that I would miss my connecting flight in Denver. When I pointed this out to someone in the airport departure gate area they told me to get on the red phone to see if an alternate connection could be arranged. Once the plane finally arrived and I boarded there was still a good possibility that I would miss my revised connecting flight in Denver. I got on one of the cars that transport passengers from one gate to another arrived 15 minutes before the connecting flight was scheduled to depart and found that it also had arrived late and was just disembarking. This of course delayed the scheduled departure time of that flight. Finally to my relief I boarded the flight from Denver to SFO only to sit on tarmac for over an hour due to lightning thunder and rain. You pay for selecting seats you pay for luggage you pay for snacks and for the flight but you are packed into an exceptionally small seating space in which you cannot even fully put your tray down comfortably. Passengers should be treated better even if they fly economy.",3us-airways,05/06/14,Never ever use this airline. Took me two days to get from JFK to Oakland instead of the 5-6 hrs it takes normally. Worst flight experience ever.,us-airways,04/06/14,I was very unhappy with my trip - flights delayed both ways and of course the connecting flight couldn't wait. I made a mad dash across the Charlotte airport from Concourse B to E (or was it the other way round?) to try to catch it though there were less than 5 minutes; I guess I hoped it might be delayed just a little bit too. But no they don't wait. On the way back two days later the Charlotte flight was delayed twice then cancelled so I got a non-stop to Miami at 7 pm rather than my original 12.50 flight. More than 6 extra hours waiting in the airport with nothing offered to make up for it. Oh yes I got switched to American since they're now the same company but US airways personnel couldn't assign my seat and I had to wait until actual boarding to get a back row seat. I think I will avoid this airline in the future if at all possible! In-air personnel were very nice about fixing my drink the way I liked it so I'll rate them higher.,1united-airlines,23/06/14,We flew LGA-DEN-LAX in United First. Were able to use the United Clubs in both La Guardia and Denver as we were continuing on an international flight from LAX on a Star Alliance Carrier. Pleasant check-in agent checked our bags direct through to Brisbane which saved us having to collect luggage in Los Angeles. First leg on A319 with only 8 in the first cabin was fantastic. One of the best FAs we have ever encountered. Food was very good and drinks flowed freely. Only gripe on this sector was lack of in flight entertainment. The aircraft was equipped with Wi-Fi but you had to pay to use it even in the first class cabin. Not much positive to write about the second leg on B737-900. One food option offered. If you didn't want it too bad. Not even offered a snack from the buy on board menu. Once service was over the FAs sat in the galley and proceeded to talk extremely loudly for the rest of the flight. You could hear them even with headphones on. This aircraft had free TV options. Overall score is largely based on first leg of this trip.,8united-airlines,23/06/14,20 June 2014. Was booked on flight KOD72G Denver to Chicago for business. Like all my previous experiences flying on United not only does the flight board beyond the stated time we pull out of the gate 40 minutes late only to be told while sitting on the runway that we are going to be held 30 minutes in our position. It's bad enough that the seats are extremely small now we're delayed over 1 hour total which causes issues with our connections. These constant delays and poor service from the airline is unacceptable.,1us-airways,03/06/14,When I was traveling to Phoenix on 5/29/2014 I had purchased a ticket leaving Spokane at 9am in the morning and arriving at 11.30. However when I printed out my boarding pass it now showed that I was to arrive at the airport at 6am and arrive in Phoenix at 9.30am. I was now stuck at the airport for 5 hours! I was not notified of the change as had to scramble to find a new ride to the airport much earlier than I had expected! This is very inconvenient! There was no email or phone call to notify that this had changed. When I departed Phoenix on 6/1/2014 I again got my boarding pass and was told to proceed to gate B10. 10 minutes before my flight should have boarded myself and 5 other passengers were looking for someone at the gate for B10 no one was there! We flagged down another airport worker and were notified that our plane was now going out of gate A3! Again no notification email or update on the US Airways phone app to let us know that the gate had changed. As it was I and the other passengers had to run to make the flight departure at gate A3. I am physically able to do this. I know that an elderly passenger would not have been able to make it as it was quite a distance away in the terminal. This is not acceptable. Any changes and corrections in flight times and gates should be updated by US Airways on the website or an email/phone app should be notified. This should lay solely on US Airways to get this information out. As it stands this was my first and last flight with US Airways and I will go out of my way to NOT fly your airline again. I was not happy with these changes and the inconvenience it provided for me.,us-airways,03/06/14,"I just came home from a week in Ireland and flew US Air from Shannon to Philadelphia. After spending a week with friendly helpful smiling people in Ireland I encountered the least friendly rudest crew I have ever seen on any flight. The flight wasn't just Americans returning home but Irish people flying to America for maybe the first time. What a terrible impression they must have made! First of all they were a mess - they didn't even appear clean. No one said hello how are you etc. Food service (and the food) was terrible. Two of the women flight attendants were arguing in the aisle over the beverage cart about how to dispose of cans. I asked for a cup of tea with milk and sugar and got one milk. When I asked for another milk you would have thought I asked her for champagne. I swear I saw some of them roll their eyes at people. When we arrived we were welcomed to Philadelphia by ""your Philadelphia-based crew"" - what a bunch of miserable unhappy impolite people. They are all in the wrong profession. On the way off the aircraft no one said goodbye have a nice day or anything. It was my worst flight experience ever. US Airways needs to work on customer service. Another observation was at Philadelphia airport while sitting at the gate for my connecting flight.",united-airlines,23/06/14,Frequent traveler with United and other airlines. United has declining service reduced food reduced beverages at United Club frequent delays Service is mixed. Seems like constant crisis at the gates. Avoid them. Latest trip was DCA to ORD.

Numerous delays and cancellations both going to and returning from my business destination. Staff rude and unhelpful. Planes dirty.

Finally at 1.30 in the morning they tell us the flight is cancelled because they don't have a Pilot! They left hundreds of people to sleep on the floor of the Charlotte airport. Not even offered a bottle of cold water.,united-airlines,23/06/14,I recently completed 3 trips on United DEN-LGA and EWR-DEN with 5 out of 6 segments in First. Overall the product is decent for domestic first class. Crew on all 6 legs were generally very friendly and chatty with the passengers (all were DEN or SFO based). They worked the whole 4 hour flight and were constantly refilling glasses. Food was a little bland but was served well along with fresh baked cookies. Problem is inconsistency in on-board products with old CO aircraft having in seat TV and UA aircraft with old overhead monitors. Some aircraft's with WI-Fi and some without which makes it difficult to work. Of the 6 flights 3 were right on time with early arrivals and 3 were delayed 45 minutes mainly because of ATC issues in NYC area.,8united-airlines,20/06/14,"I travel all the time for business and booked on United for cost reasons I was flying last-minute from LGA to MSP. I was scheduled to depart at 6pm from NY change planes in Chicago with an hour layover time and land in Minneapolis by 9.30pm. Departing flight was listed ""on time"". 5.45 boarding still had not begun - asked the gate attendant when we would be boarding since I had a connector. He informed me that they were about to delay the flight indefinitely. After advice from customer service that my original flight is unlikely to take off in time for me to make any connection in Chicago I am rebooked on a flight scheduled to depart an hour later - 7pm. However this means I will miss my O'Hare connection so that is also rebooked to a 10pm CDT flight. 7pm flight boards on time. Around the time of boarding the originally-scheduled 6pm flight also starts the boarding process. Chaos at the 7pm flight's gate as multiple irate businessmen who had changed out of their 6pm first- class seats for a time-saving economy seat on the 7pm scramble to articulate their outrage and get rebooked on the now-departing earlier flight. At 7.10pm the 7pm flight is finally loaded - and completely full. It's sweltering hot and ripe with body odor and very very dimly lit. 7.20pm: still hot still smelly still dark. Flight attendants are trying their best to be accommodating. The plane finally acquires a couple of pilots 45 minutes after scheduled departure. At this point I am getting nervous that I may miss my re-booked connector as well in which case I will either have to overnight in Chicago or drive the 6.5 hours to St. Paul. The plane touches down in Chicago only a little bit late despite the delay in take-off. Stopped on the runway in the middle of taxi - stops for at least 20 minutes. Flight attendant makes an attempt to ask passengers to remain seated so those with tight connectors can deplane first. His plea is denied immediately by the scores of tired and angry people who flood the corridor before the plane has even reached the gate. Fighting through 35 rows of people I manage to deplane with 10 minutes to spare before boarding call for the connection. Arrive sweaty and out of breath at the gate just as my phone brings up a text from United: flight is delayed until 10.30 because the plane hasn't arrived. The gate attendant changes the sign to read 10.45 instead. Once 1035 hits she updates it once more - to 10.51. In short she assures there is no possible way I will arrive before midnight (CDT). I will never be taking United again.",1us-airways,02/06/14,Since February US Air has been an unmitigated disaster. Had 2 early morning flights back to back in Tampa cancelled on 2 brand new Airbus 320. Then a cancelled flight due to a bent fan blade in Ottawa where I then had to spend the night. Ground operations in Charlotte are a joke and even with 2 hr layovers I have had to scramble to make my connections. Then last night in Washington all is good until 30 min before departure then I get the email notice flight is cancelled. Call US Air. Cancellation due to another mechanical issue on a CRJ 200. I then chose to drive the 3 hours home. These US Air personnel are a joke. The passengers are held as hostages with one pack off lies told on top of another.

Weather was not the problem. United should have re-booked us when their mechanical failure and four hour delay was apparent in Houston. Ours was a 26 hour ordeal with many of those hours standing in line waiting for service and that was completely avoidable. What did they offer? A $7 food voucher.,1united-airlines,20/06/14,"SFO-CDG-SFO. Over the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to travel internationally on both United and several foreign carriers. United's First Class or Business First Class service and amenities are no better than those in economy on the foreign carriers. Outbound we didn't get drinks prior to take off as the flight attendants were spending way too much time chatting with the other passengers. The meals were satisfactory though I am getting a bit bored with the ice cream sundae. The inflight entertainment worked well though it would have been nice to have different choices on the return flight. The only thing United's front cabin had going for it was more comfortable seats than in the back of the plane however even that comes with a ""but"". On the 767 the pods next to the window have very limited room for your feet when in the flat position. The aisle seats do seem to have more room. I travel weekly for work so I will continue to fly United but if I were a leisure traveler without frequent flyer status I would choose another airline. (United treats it leisure passengers very poorly - they board last often have no bin space and are generally treated shabbily.) United barely lives up to its three star rating.",5us-airways,26/05/14,This has been the most stressful trip I have taken. Hearing my flight have been canceled 2 times waiting at the airport for 6 hours and having to wait in lines with 100+ people is the worst thing that has happened in all of my trips I've taken with an airline. I reached my mid-way point in Charlotte North Carolina rushing to my flight that was suppose to take off in 30 minutes. They then announce that the flight has been canceled and that we go visit the service desk. Almost about an hour wait. Once I got to talk to one of the service agents she was really rude and barely communicated with me. She then found me a flight 4 hours from then. The flight attendants then told us to walk to a different gate to a later time to fly to Nashville. I am never going to be looking at US Airlines to fly again.,us-airways,24/05/14,"Delays on all booked flights. Outward bound - Dublin to Philadelphia Philadelphia to Vegas. Vegas to LA. Baggage did not make the connection from Phil to Vegas. arrived some hours later. Cabin staff were unfriendly and quite rude. From Dublin We were sitting at the back of the plane and there was no selection of meal available and we were told ""thats what you get when you travel at the back"" . I opened my little tub of butter which had been heated to the extent that when I opened it it was in hot liquid and went all over my hand. I said to the stewardess who was passing by who could have brought me a napkin to wipe the liquid off my hands - but she sped by saying ""oh I know that happens"". Only that I had a tray of food on my lap she would have had more to deal with! We were told by cabin crew that all baggage was to be stored in the overhead lockers or underneath the seat in front. This obviously does not apply to cabin staff whose baggage was piled high on the back centre aisle seats of the plane it was not secured in any way. Their baggage was a danger to all the passengers in that area. Maybe the company should practice what they preach and put staff baggage in the hold. Cabin crew were ungroomed in appearance. Homeward bound to Dublin. Flight from Philadelphia to Orlando delayed resulting in us overnighting in Orlando  very grateful for the overnight accommodation provided at the Hyatt. Flew to Charlotte the next day for flight to Dublin. Boarding for Dublin at Charlotte was very confused and inefficiently exercised by Gate staff - resulting in delay in take-off. Entertainment delivery was of very poor quality on those flights that had the facility. General impression overall. Very Disappointing.",3united-airlines,20/06/14,Flew from Los Angeles to London. All alcoholic drinks are charged. This is a first for me on an international flight that isn't a budget airline. The drinks service took twice as long as normal due to the charging process. Staff were clearly embarrassed by the policy and apologized for it. Will never fly United again.,6united-airlines,20/06/14,I have flown this airline (on the way to Ukraine) twice in the past. This time I flew to Frankfurt Germany. Each time has been progressively worse. Every flight was delayed beginning with my flight out of Huntsville and on each connecting flight. One time they said it was some latch was broken or something to do with the luggage conveyor belt to load the suitcases into the airplane. Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it. The seats on the 747 were so jam packed together I always felt squashed into the neighboring passenger. Their computers were broken at the airport and so there was another half hour delay getting through customs was horrible enough on my return trip but dealing with United's mess was just reprehensible.,1us-airways,21/05/14,This flight was conducted like a zoo. Three women with their children on the flight requested to change their seats. Passengers and the flight attendant tried to comply with their request. Actually they farmed all their kids out and the 3 mothers sat together drinking wine for the whole flight. Their children did not fasten their seat belts until other passengers reminded them too. The plane had to move after attempting to attach the new jetway without success. Nobody instructed the passengers to sit down so people were going to the bathroom children were jumping on the seats and luggage was in the walkway while they moved the plane to a new jetway. The flight attendant was not looking out for anyone's safety. I could not wait to get off this plane!,2us-airways,21/05/14,"Terrible. I had two flights which connected in Philadelphia. The first was 5.5 hours long from San Francisco to Philadephia; no entertainment whatsoever no complimentary snacks and extremely uncomfortable seats. The second was from Philadelphia to Toronto; delayed 3 hours due to maintenance all of the food service had closed in that Terminal at 8pm. I had just come off the 5.5 hour flight and was starving. We finally boarded the flight attendant was very rude. I asked if there was any way I could have any nuts or something as I was so hungry he rudely said ""No this is a short flight I'm sure you will survive."" (There was no other food service offered). The flight was only about an hour: they continually shut off all the lights as if people were to sleep and they turn all the fluorescents on again - this happened 5 or 6 times within the hour. I will never fly US Airways again unless they step up their game it was a very unpleasant day.",2united-airlines,20/06/14,Sheer incompetence to deal with cancellations. First they do not communicate them. Secondly the staff are rude and never apologizes for the inconvenience caused. Thirdly they are unable to get you onto other flights in a timely manner. How is my experience? I haven't been able to start my trip yet. A 48 hour delay so far. Two trips to the airport. Two hours on the phone. And six hours waiting in line to get a new flight plus two more to get the luggage that had already been checked in. I am trying to go on a vacation of seven days that has already been reduced to five after having paid over $3000. I am a seasoned air traveler and have had many flights cancelled in my life. But I have never come across such incompetence and rudeness. Never again.,1us-airways,19/05/14,"Online reservations and ticketing was fine. Check in fine. Philadelphia terminal a filthy unsanitary mess. Carpet strewn with trash half eaten food and beverages dirty seats burned out light bulbs. Boarding process a shambles. I paid the asking price for my ticket and purchased it long in advance of my flight. I was seated mid cabin on an aisle. There were 5 boarding groups called. How I ended up in the last Group 5 is beyond me. So I ended up stumbling over a planeload of passengers to get to my seat. Inflight I had the audacity to request a second beverage after finishing my first. I had paid for an inflight meal that was loaded with salt and needed a drink. As the flight attendant was passing through the aisle I politely asked for another beverage ""whenever you get the chance I know you're busy"". The reply: ""It won't be any time soon. Water and coffee only"". The same attendant walked past 3 times empty-handed before I asked a second attendant for the beverage. I received no reply and was really certain that I hadn't been heard. A few minutes later the drink arrived which is good and bad. Good: I got my drink. Bad: There seems to be no feeling by the attendants that passenger requests need be acknowledged. I have tired and tried with US Airways. American Airlines hasn't helped them one bit. Perhaps to the contrary. Look elsewhere for your transportation needs if at all possible.",2us-airways,19/05/14,DUB-PHL-DTW-PHL-DUB on A330-200 & Embraer 175. The aircraft were clean and seemed relatively new. All flights ran early - with the exception on the last one which had a minor 20 minute delay. The US immigration pre-clearance in Dublin was very good. The food was not great but not bad either and the same goes for the inflight service. The wine was unpalatable. IFE on the A330 was great - lots of new films. No IFE on the short flight but this is not expected. All in all - good flights and as expected. Nothing to get excited by. US Airways is not a 4 or 5 star airline but does not seem to claim to be that either. They seem to be on a par with most other North American carriers. I would fly with them again but would prefer to fly BA or Virgin if I had the option.,7united-airlines,20/06/14,Travelled with United on 6 flights from 23/05/2014-08/06/2014 Heathrow to Las Vegas to Hawaii and back. On the 6 flights we were only fed two meals from Heathrow to Houston and Washington to Heathrow. We queried this with the customer services and were told in Washington that they do supply food on interior (domestic) flights shame we were not informed of this before we flew with them. We changed our flight from Newark New York when we arrived at Heathrow at the start of our holiday because they asked us if we would obviously New York was overbooked which resulted in us missing our connection to Las Vegas. They were unhelpful at Houston and put us on Standby. We thought the cabin crew were scruffy unhelpful and lazy. I asked for a small bottle of water to be told that they did not have enough so could not give me one. They did serve enough drinks on the flights so what were they doing. I will never fly with them again.,5united-airlines,20/06/14,We flew from IAD to BRU with United. (Boeing 777). Very nice cabin crew normal catering good flight. Flight was delayed but we got good information from the flight deck.,7us-airways,19/05/14,I flew US Airways from Honolulu to Phoenix and the service and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The staff in Honolulu was fantastic and went out of their way to quickly and efficiently get everyone through check in and onto the flight (there was a huge line at check in). They even checked bags at no cost to help speed along the process. Once on the flight things quickly deteriorated. People were packed in like sardines and we were asked to pay for sleeping packs. With little to no room to move it was a miserable 6 hrs. Once off the flight the customer service representative was incredibly rude when I asked to be placed on a stand by flight leaving sooner to my final destination. I was forcefully educated that just because U.S. Airways and American airways have merged you cannot schedule or a adjust American flights with U.S. Overall this experience was trying given how much I spent on flights. I recommend Southwest for future flights and warn others to keep clear of flying US Airways or American Airlines.,2us-airways,11/05/14,I cannot begin to tell you how consistently terrible this airline is. I was flying recently from Washington DC to Portland Maine. The pilot came over the loudspeaker and said we were going to set down in Philly. A light was going off that indicated that the door was not shut correctly. So we went into Philly where some of us made other arrangements others had to wait a day. A week later I was flying from Detroit back to Maine and had a 2 hour layover in Philly. I thought that this would be ample time to make my next flight but U.S. Airways missed the connection. When I went to the service counter they said it would be two days before I could get out of Philly. I went to another counter and they said it would be a day before I could get out but that I was on my own for hotel accommodations. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from US Airways.,1united-airlines,20/06/14,We took a business class flight from London Heathrow to Houston Bush round trip. On the flight to Houston the video screen at my seat my wife's seat and several other seats did not work at all. The flight crew tried to fix it but couldn't. They promised to have someone contact us for some credit. Never heard from them. On the return flight the seat would not recline the movies continuously skipped there was no music available and the food was awful. Flight crew tried to fix it. No luck. Flying BA from now on.,1united-airlines,20/06/14,Very poor quality service. Lack of in seat entertainment on 5 hour flights even in Business class is simply unacceptable in this day and age. I was also refused access to a lounge on an international business class seat because my son in a wheelchair was flying economy on a school trip. Basic customer service would have seen the airline allow us to enter the lounge.,5us-airways,11/05/14,I was travelling from Paris to Houston for business. As a last minute surprise my company offered to purchase a domestic ticket so that I could see my family in Pennsylvania which I gladly accepted. All in all I flew Paris- Charlotte Charlotte-Houston Houston-Dallas and Dallas-DC. I drove to Pennsylvania from DC. The day before my flight back to Paris I went online to check-in and noticed that I actually had to fly DC-Philly then Philly to Paris so I called US Airways to ask if I could simply check-in in Philly. They replied that this would be a $300 up-charge even though I was asking to eliminate a portion of my journey. I spoke with 3 customer service representatives and they all told me that since a direct flight was more expensive that I would need to pay more to fly less. It makes sense when booking a flight online that a direct journey would be more expensive than a non-direct one but at this point my seat was already reserved. I was told that this was 'impossible' and that if I didn't check-in in DC my whole flight would be cancelled. What I understood was that the customer service department is simply unwilling to help their guests. I will never fly with this company again.,5us-airways,10/05/14,This airline is the worst my husband and I have traveled before. He is on a business trip and since the beginning they are delaying and delaying the trips. All his flights had been delayed going in and out of Memphis. He couldn't get back today because his flight was so delayed that he lost the connection with another 12 persons. It took them 2 hours to schedule another flight for the next morning and instead of giving him his original flight to Harrisburg they sent him to Chicago to guess what delayed the flight again because they change planes for mechanical problems. They don't respect the schedules.,1united-airlines,20/06/14,Why is it that United is the only airline that cancelled a flight from Denver to Omaha due to weather but all the other airlines going to and from Denver only delayed? Of course because we are having poor weather they can blame it on the weather which means as a customer we cannot recoup anything from them and we have to then wait until a pm flight when we are scheduled on the first flight out of OMA. I wonder how many times this airplane has been cancelled in the last couple of weeks it sounds as if this airlines has an issue with mechanical problems and only wants to bandaid the problem. I am all for a company making money but not at the expense of the customers who are paying their bills!,1united-airlines,20/06/14,Flying EWR-NRT with Flight UA 79. Boeing 777. Punishing 14-hr flight in cramped seating condition. Everything about this plane is run down from seating to carpeting. Food is terrible and served in plastic tray covered with ripped aluminium foils. Breads are served out of bundles of plastic bags instead of bread baskets. What are we in jail? Ridiculous!,1us-airways,08/05/14,April 24th red eye from SAN-MSP via PHX. Little to complain about flight-wise were pretty close to being on time and no issues in-flight. Got the dreaded ZONE 5 for our boarding pass and my wife was nervous about having to gate check her carry-on (the last thing you want to do after a red eye flight is wait around at the airport for baggage) but there ended up being plenty of room.,8us-airways,07/05/14,Traveled several times over last 5 weeks with this airline. No major gripes with any flight. Most recent trip CLT to LaGuardia Flight 2064 May 1 and return Flight 1851 May 4. Delays first trip which could not be helped due to problems in NY. Captain very informative of what was happening. Friendly crew. Trip back no delays. Informative Captain and very friendly crew. Only gripe CLT check in staff need to up their game a lot. New York staff very helpful and friendly.,8united-airlines,18/06/14,IAH-PTY and reverse. Pleasant staff decent food plane rather small for business class no musical options in entertainment system.,6united-airlines,18/06/14,We flew from SFO to FRA and returned from OSL to SFO on UA. The service for these international flights was good the cabin staff helpful and professional and the flights on time. The seats in cheap economy were extremely cramped and offer little hope of rest. The flight over had a large contingent of passengers from the Indian subcontinent who did not take the hint to settle down and rest when the crew turned down the lights and yakked the night away oblivious to requests to quiet down. Not UA's fault but they could have been a bit more pro- active to settle these people back into their seats for the long flight.,4us-airways,05/05/14,Flying from London Heathrow to San Diego via Philadelphia. On check in was informed of slight delay but told to go through anyway. Once through security clearance boards showed 7 hours delay on flight. I went to Customer service desk to ask what would happen about connections or overnight accommodation at Philadelphia as it seemed likely that I'd miss any connections that day. Customer service agent told me they had no idea when the flight would actually leave but that of course they'd honour the connection as it wasn't my fault and that it would all be worked out once we were airborne. She could tell me nothing because she had no information at all. So I decided to make use of the otherwise wasted time working on my PC in the executive lounge. About 2 hours later the flight disappeared from the display boards. I went back to the customer service desk to find it closed! There was a sign giving a phone number to call - which I did the person on the other end told me she couldn't book me on to any alternative flights - somehow I was too late in the queue and all available seats had already been allocated and she expected me to be pleased with the fact that she'd booked me onto the following days flight 24 hours later. No offer of overnight accommodation or transport back home overnight. When I asked about my bags she told me to ask at the ticket desk the other side of security (ie landside rather than airside). So I exited the departures area back to the check-in area only to find the customer service desk closed with a sign up saying anyone affected by the flight cancellation should call the number I'd already been talking to. On checking in again the following day there was no hint of any apology for the disruption. I asked about getting an upgrade by way of compensation and was told that was not permissible - though I could ask at the ticket desk (though by that time I had already been allocated a seat). This was the first time I had tried US Airways and looks like being my last.,us-airways,01/05/14,I've flown twice in the last month with US Airways and I have to say never again. Their customer service is terrible. Every flight was late. No explanation. On my most recent flight from Washington to Portland Maine I missed a connection. My layover was 2 hours long so I thought there would be no problem. But after a delay following a delay following a delay I missed my connection. The first thing the US Airways representative told me and he was a manager was that I should fly Delta. A couple of weeks earlier I was flying from Washington to Portland and we had to set down in Philadelphia because the captain told us the door wasn't shut properly. Now I know there are a lot of jobs to do before flight can take off but I think shutting the door properly should be in the top two or three on the list. The mix of arrogance in this organization baffles me.,united-airlines,18/06/14,"TPE-SFO-TPE. Economy Plus. B-777 aircraft. United has become a very average airline. Economy""plus"" seats are really not much better than normal economy especially if you can get regular economy seats near exits or bulkheads. Food was mediocre. Flight attendants were considerably older than other airlines and seemed to be worn out as evidenced by their indifferent and even sarcastic attitudes. Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes. The one saving grace for this United flight was the price which was significantly lower than other TPE-SFO non stops. So I guess you get what you pay for. Recommended for price but if you can afford it any of the Asian airlines offer better service.",6united-airlines,16/06/14,"I recently flew in the first class section of a United Airlines 757 from Orlando to Dulles (about a 2 hour flight). The only things to like is that I arrived promptly on schedule and my seat was larger than a coach seat. Otherwise there is absolutely no reason to fly first class on United domestically. I asked for a blanket and was told after some time that ""the supervisor said we don't stock blankets on flights from Florida"". Then less than 1 minute later a different flight attendant brought a large clear plastic bag full of blankets onto the plane and put them into a closet in first class! I'd just left Disney World and the contrast of the Disney quality of service versus United's was stark. I began to wonder if the safety and evacuation training for United employees is better than their customer service training otherwise you better hope you never need them!",6us-airways,29/04/14,Connecting flight out of Charlotte supposed to take off at 10.11pm delayed until 11.30 due to no crew - get boarded only to have to defuel for over an hour. Then the mechanical problems started for another 2 hours so 3 hours sitting in the plane at the gate - only to get deboarded. It is now 3am no explanations no water no snacks. Get reboarded at 4.30am - sit for another hour - get deboarded yet again! They say they have until 10am to cancel the flight. If they don't cancel you will pay for any other flights. There aren't any flights until the day after tomorrow no hotels either. Airport/airplane for 10.5 hours past original flight time. Instead of being apologetic and nice they acted like they were doing us all a favor by letting us sit in our seats. Another US air flight was cancelled earlier in the evening due to mechanical issues as well - guess they were tired of dealing with us.,us-airways,28/04/14,CLT-HAM. We take this trip every 2 years. I will never fly US Airways again! My story is very similar to everyone else's. They cancelled my first flight delaying our arrival by 1 day. We couldn't leave from our original location told to drive 3 hrs to Charlotte. Then they overbooked our rescheduled flight. They seated my family (children) in all different areas of the plane. They had no vegetarian options for one of us therefore she was starving on a 8 hour flight. They made an error on our return flight. Lost our luggage. Directed us to the wrong gate in PHL. When we arrived at the correct gate the attendant would not let us on the plane and she refused to help rebook our flight. We had been traveling for more than 20 hrs.,united-airlines,16/06/14,"YYC-IAH-MUC in Y. As an Aeroplan Elite I got premier access check in and boarding which was greatly appreciated. I also like that United seems to be making an effort to control oversized carry-ons. As a result both flights even the full flight to Munich left with all bags in the cabin. Planes were comfortable and clean (A320 and 764) with adequate room for my 5'8"" self. Crews were generally fantastic a real surprise given United's reputation. I like United's boarding structure as it prevents a mad dash to board and worked very well making boarding easy and comfortable. Only gripe is food on 10 hour IAH-MUC flight- small dinner and then before landing a mini croissant and small fruit cup- This is what I usually get on YYZ-MUC but that is a 7 hour flight. I expected more on this longer route and can imagine that some larger passengers were quite hungry! Connection in IAH was also very easy no security screening required no bus or train either even though I had to change terminals. Very impressed!",8united-airlines,16/06/14,What a shame a wonderful Airline like Air New Zealand code shares with United Airlines. After a wonderful flight with Air New Zealand from Australia we then flew business with United within the United States. The 6 hour flight between New York and Los Angeles was a nightmare. From the small old plane to the noise from where the stewards were working( they couldn't help the noise as the work area is so small). Not to mention the very small unclean toilet. None of United earphones seem to work (I now know why most people on the flight had their own). The whole flight was a nightmare. I will never fly United again or recommend them.,1us-airways,27/04/14,12 April 2014 Departed LHR flight no 729. Flight was 1 hour late taking off due to aircraft not being ready for passenger seating cleaning and food availability. Inflight entertainment was average seating as expected for economy class food was satisfactory but as a vegetarian I do not find it acceptable that the airline had run out of vegetarian options. I then had to wait a while for a vegetarian option to arrive. Landing was smooth arriving an hour later than scheduled meant there was not enough time to complete customs and security checks. Upon arriving at customs we were greeted by a spiralling queue of extremely anxious passengers customs were unable to manage the large quantity of passengers this resulted in us waiting for more than 1 hour no provision made for late arriving passengers to be fast tracked through customs to allow us to board our connecting flight. We were reassured that the flight would not take off without us. We ran to the gate displayed on the departures board and when we arrived at our gate we were disappointed to find that the flight had taken off without us. We waited to speak to a customer service representative for over 2 hours. We asked to be put on the next available flight and got no response was booked onto 10am flight the next morning. I asked where we would stay for the next 12 hours staff member shrugged. We walked away from customer services feeling so disappointed. We spent the night in the airport. Decided to approach customer service again totally different attitude and approach. Given a freshen up bag put us on standby for the 6am flight to Orlando. We arrived at the gate patiently and we were lucky to be boarded on this flight. Finally arrived at our destination 12 hours later. Luckily our baggage was waiting in the bag claim office. I would never fly with this airline again.,us-airways,27/04/14,"My husband and I were on our first day of our honeymoon traveling to Cancun. We boarded the flight in Charlotte NC to leave at 1.20. We sat there on the plane in separate areas from 1.20 until 3.30 waiting for the numerous ""15"" minutes of repairs they had to do. After finally waiting over 2 hours they started taking the luggage off without informing the attendees the flight was going to be cancelled. We waited another 15 minutes or so and they announced the flight was cancelled. We waited about 40 minutes in a long line waiting to catch another flight which they couldn't get us out until the next day in the middle of the day and we had to go back through security. So not only are we paying for a day of our all inclusive resort that we will not be at but now have to pay for food and everything. This was supposed to be the best day going on my honeymoon but it has been a nightmare.",1united-airlines,16/06/14,"Our connection in San Francisco got cancelled due to aircraft maintenance. This was in the very early morning so there were no additional flights available for 5+ hours. After some research of the flight number that got cancelled this flight had been cancelled 2 additional times in the previous 3 weeks. That's one cancellation per week for this one aircraft. After we made it from San Francisco to LA for our re-route the LA flight was delayed an hour due to late aircraft arrival. Once we boarded we waited on the plane for 1 hour after everyone was boarded and settled in. Pilot originally said it was due to weather and admitted it was due to ""paper-work"" before takeoff. Unbelievable. We landed 8 hours after the original time we were told. United uses primarily outdated planes with no on-demand in-flight entertainment. When they do offer their on-demand entertainment like Live DirecTV it costs money. Long flights (7+) could offer good personal TVs but that is rare. Wifi is unheard of my flight months ago was promised wifi but once boarded they claimed the original plane had to be switched so no wifi. Customer service is atrocious also. We were offered $7 each for food at the airport we had to wait at but that's it. I know a friend who had two flights cancelled in the same night due to airline problems. As a MileagePlus cardholder much more is expected. When we tried to get upgraded on our re-routed flights the guy said ""Oh this is a mileage flight"". This is the worst American airline aside from Spirit Airlines. Fly JetBlue or Virgin America if possible.",1united-airlines,13/06/14,I'm satisfied with my first couple of flights with United May-June 2014. I flew transatlantic EWR-Zurich and LHR T2-EWR I tried outbound on a premium plus seat for 125$ add on pretty comfortable. I'm only disappointed because I did not receive my special meal as requested the air hostess asked me to confirm with United's customer service centre next time. Otherwise arrived on time clean comfortable although too cold cabin. Good entertainment. I'm giving United also a good satisfaction rate because of 100% mileage earned on my loyalty program of another Star Alliance member.,7us-airways,22/04/14,"Not only are US Airways employees rude they also are simply not willing to provide any sort of customer service and are not responsible for people missing their flights. I flew to San Juan from PHL and a return flight over PHL to NYC. My 4-year-old and I were seated 15 rows apart on a flight from PHL to San Juan and I had to wait in the aisle for 30 minutes until somebody was kind enough to let my daughter and I sit next to each other. On our flight back from San Juan to PHL the lady at the desk seated my daughter and I 5 rows apart on the connecting flight from PHL to LaGuardia. I did not realize this until 5 minutes later and went back to the same lady. Her answer - ""Oh just ask one of the passengers they'll switch seats with you."" The flight from San Juan to PHL was delayed because of ""bad weather conditions"". When we got to PHL an hour late our connecting flight to LA Guardia in NYC had already left. Another rude US Airways employee gave us tickets for a flight the next morning and as already mentioned above told us they would neither help find transportation nor a hotel. Because of their guidelines they would not release our luggage so now we are in NYC where we got at 4 am. US Airways have no customer service.",us-airways,21/04/14,We were on our way home from San Francisco to Salt Lake City and we had a one hour layover in Phoenix. When we got to San Francisco we had already got the call that our flight was delayed 35 minutes. We tried to get on another flight but none were available. When we were checking in it was very hard to get some help because for some reason the kiosk let myself check my bag but not my friend. It took a good 10 minutes to get any help and we just kept getting walked past. Got to the gate and the plane ended up being delayed for 50 minutes now. When we got to Phoenix we had 5 minutes to get to our next flight. Turns out they changed the gate last minute and instead of only having to go from gate A10 to A12 we had to go from about A20 to B2 in 5 minutes. My friend and I sprinted from our gate to get to the next one and we arrived with one minute before they close the doors (since they close them 10 minutes before departure) The door was closed and there wasn't a sole around. I went to the next gate and I explained our flight was delayed twice and there was a last minute gate change. Very rudely she told me she was aware and then went back to talking to her friend. The customer service agent was not helpful at all as well and was very rude. No one apologized and we had to stay in Phoenix that night because no more flights were going out until 7am then next morning. I will never fly with US Airways again.,1united-airlines,13/06/14,I was surprised at such a pleasant experience. We flew two US internal flights. The first was on time the second twenty mins late due to a minor technical fault. We were impressed with the monitors in the gate area showing available seating on the aircraft and probable departure time. We had no problem with carry on baggage. On the first flight people who had not checked in bigger bags were given labels and picked up their bags when they got off the plane. Plane was clean staff friendly coffee OK and the seat comfort was OK. No complaints - and I have to say I have suffered a lot worse.,7united-airlines,13/06/14,AMS-ORD 11 Jul. I had a most wonderful flight on United from Amsterdam to Chicago. The flight attendants were warm and made the experience one to remember. The flight departed and arrived on time. The new business class seats are great though I did not try the lie-flat option. I was in the pair next to the galley - fair warning the freezer compartment is next to the aisle seat and does make noise - need to wear your headphones. Food was great - had Thai chicken for main. However to repeat it was the flight attendants that made this flight one of the best I have experienced.,10us-airways,19/04/14,ORD-PHL-YQB (Quebec City). A320 to PHL - maybe only 45 people on the plane so boarding was quick and we departed the gate early. Flight Attendants were very personable and not what I usually get on US Airways. Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight. I know they don't offer inflight entertainment but so many people have their own Ipads and Ipods and such - its not that big of a deal. Keep up the good work.,8us-airways,17/04/14,US Airways is the worst. Their flights out of New Orleans are oversold so if you don't check in at least 30 minutes before your flight you will be bumped. I tried to get my boarding pass from the computer about 28 minutes before departure time and it could not be done. I spoke to the agent and they said that I had to rebook to another flight. I begged and they said no. They put me on a later flight and I go through security and my original flight was still at the gate for 20 minutes! They had already given away my seat and I couldn't board. Zero customer service. Horrible for business travel. I will go out of my way to avoid US Air.,united-airlines,13/06/14,This has been the worst travel experience I have had. My original flight was cancelled I was not informed of this until I arrived at the airport. This should be standard protocol to notify passengers that the flight is cancelled. On top of that the customer service is atrocious. As I was reasonably upset and asking customer service to find me another flight she tells me that the next flight to my destination is boarding now but you cannot get on it. They put me on a connecting flight to Chicago 4 hours later. 4 hours later all Chicago flights were delayed another 2 hours. Meanwhile flights are boarding all around me. I strongly advise you to stay as far away as possible from United.,1united-airlines,13/06/14,"Leaving Newark yesterday the gate agent announced that ""all overhead bin room was full"" as boarding group 4 (out of 5) was beginning to board. They forced gate check of all carry-on bags for all the remaining passengers. On boarding there were tons of open overhead bins with room remaining including one right at my seat! Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that ""sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point"". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead. United has adopted a new policy and attitude about baggage that is Draconian - they should be ashamed. I will not fly United even though they have the only non-stop flights to my most frequent destination.",1us-airways,16/04/14,I was on a trip with my 5 year old son from NY to AL. We arrived at the gate of our connecting flight in Charlotte NC just as they were closing the gate although we were there 10 min prior to takeoff. I explained that we were flying down for a funeral which we would miss if we were delayed. The gate attendant told me I was 30 seconds late and not getting on the flight. My return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and the connecting return flight sat on the runway for 45 minutes. It appears that exceptions to delay are only made when it is to benefit their company and not for their paying customers. I will never again fly US Airways!,us-airways,16/04/14,Flew to the Dominican Republic from Detroit 4/4 with a stop in Philadelphia. First flight 40 minutes late had to literally run with 2 kids through the airport to make our connection in Philly. Didn't realize there was no need to run because that flight was delayed also. Boarded 45 minutes late sat on the plane for 30 minutes at which time they made everyone get off the plane. Sat in the waiting are for another hour while they attended to 'broken seats'. Flew home on 4/10 - flight delayed in DR for 1.5 hours with no explanation. Only had a 2 hour lay over in Philly where we also had to go through immigration and customs. Again we managed to make our connection only because the flight from Philly to Detroit was late again. That's 4 flights - all delayed. Don't you think if you have 20-30 passengers who are on the verge of missing their connecting flights that they would have those people get off the plane first? They couldn't have cared one iota. I will never fly US Air again nor would I recommend it to anyone. I can't rate the Inflight Entertainment because there wasn't any. A 4 hours flight and no entertainment of wi-fi?,united-airlines,13/06/14,Quebec City to Newark on a regional jet. When I checked in at the airport I was told the flight was delayed 2.5 hours due to Newark traffic problems. There is no Star Alliance lounge at the airport. Listening to podcasts on my computer I heard a boarding call after only a one hour delay. After boarding the plane the captain said he was expected a smooth flight. The fasten seatbelt sign was never turned off during the smooth flight which makes one wonder if they ever turn off the fasten seatbelt sign on this flight. Customs and Immigration were done in Newark unlike other Canadian airports.,3united-airlines,12/06/14,TXL-EWR-LAX in Y. Had wanted to take the 757 flight from Berlin to Newark since the route was opened up by Continental. Since the merger between the two airlines is far from complete I knew the crew would all be Continental and knowing how poorly the new United is perceived not just by customers but staff too the old- fashioned Continental Airlines flight bag I hauled out of the back of my closet scored me a glass of champagne as I passed through the forward galley en route to my economy seat. Left on time catering was decent (one area the new United hasn't yet cut to the bone) although movie choices were limited to new releases so I read my book and did some work. Immigration at Newark was relatively painless due to the early scheduled arrival time of 1200 beating the afternoon rush. Short visit to the United Club which is comfortable although the snack options are awful. For the second leg to Los Angeles found myself back at the gate I'd arrived at. Some infrequent fliers consider narrowbody hardware unsuitable for long haul as it is â€œcrampedâ€ù or â€œclaustrophic take it from someone who flew on the same 757 all the way from Berlin to LA the size of the seat is the same as the biggest planes (except 10-abreast 777s where it is considerably narrower) and the smaller numbers at boarding baggage claim and immigration mean small is beautiful. The second leg to California was quite decent enjoyed a chicken-and-blue- cheese wrap for sale and the view of the North American continent unfolding beneath our wing. Arrival into LAX was on-time and baggage delivery was prompt. No complaints â€“ this time.,8us-airways,15/04/14,US Airways Express: They decided to cancel an express flight from Philadelphia to Newark due to a lack of people and have the next one 3 hours later. I have completely lost all confidence in US Express and recommend no one to fly this airline again. They also refuse to compensate travelers due to their incompetence.,1us-airways,15/04/14,Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to Honolulu Hawaii and returning from HNL to PHX. US 690 and US 693. March 24 2014 from PHX to HNL. April 1 2014 return to PHX from HNL. Having read the most recent reviews for March and April flights thought I would add mine. US Airways has been calling themselves American Airlines for many years. This time there was a 1.5 hr delay going to Hawaii due to mechanical problems. Every time I have flown with US Air there has been long delays flight cancellations you name it. Why did we fly again? They were the cheapest.,2united-airlines,12/06/14,I read the reviews of this airline and was terrified. However we flew San Antonio to Dulles and Dulles to Boston and we were impressed. OK so the leg room is not fantastic but its better than many. The plane was reasonably clean the staff friendly and the coffee drinkable. Furthermore the flight to Dulles was on time. The Boston one left about 20 mins late due to an error light re the toilet showing in the cockpit but again the plane was clean and the staff friendly and efficient. No complaints.,8united-airlines,12/06/14,My family and I flew United to Mexico for a wedding. We were scheduled to return to the United States on Monday 5/9/2014. Our scheduled flight was delayed 3.5 hours due to weather in Texas. This was understandable. The rest of this journey was not. In Mexico we were switched from our connecting flight due to the scheduled departure time. The flight we were switched to departed prior to our arrival at the Houston Airport. My family along with several others in our same situation then attempted to obtain another flight. The United personnel at the Houston Airport were very rude and not at all helpful. We spent over 16 hours in the airport with no blankets pillows or cots. I will never again fly United. The delays were one thing but the attitude of the employees was completely unacceptable.,1us-airways,13/04/14,I flew RT last week BDL-CLT-RSW. On-time flights courteous gate agents and flight attendants and helpful ticket counter people. I was surprised as the (for me) usual mediocre experience was actually much improved.,9us-airways,11/04/14,Flew US Air A330-300 from Rome (FCO) to Charlotte (CLT). Honestly I wasn't excited about having been assigned to this flight/carrier. Once on the aircraft there was a noticeable change from its US domestic counterpart there was personal AVOD at each seat head with ample choices for the long flight the seats had ample leg room and appeared wide and comfy. The flight crew were friendly and quick to please and even did a walk through picking up trash that had accumulated on the deck (rare for a US carrier). The international product that US Airways offers has left a positive impression and I won't be hesitant to fly this airline in the future. The A330-300 was spacious and smooth in flight.,10united-airlines,12/06/14,F class KOA-LAX. A warm crew was the bright spot in an extremely inferior product. Small tray with all courses at the same time followed by a cookie in a paper bag. For a 5 hour flight this is ridiculous. Hawaii routes are served with the oldest run down aircraft. Leg room is adequate but entertainment option is pathetic. For first class Hawaiian is the only way to go. United is just sad.,1united-airlines,10/06/14,UA1284 EWR-SFO 14 May 2014. No IFE or WiFi on a transcon? That's what I found when flying on brand new 737-900. I've flown UA's older -900s and they have DirecTV-okay you have to pay for it but it's still better than nothing. The flight itself was pleasant the new seats reasonably comfortable. One thing I've always liked about UA is that at least one flight attendant comes out every 30 minutes or so and has cups of water or the beverage cart coming around. But no entertainment? I could have flown Southwest they don't claim to have IFE on their flights.,6us-airways,09/04/14,Flew overnight from LAX to Philadelphia. Despite logging in on-line and assigning seats together a week or so beforehand and checking on the day of the flight my wife and I ended up at different ends of the cabin which wasn't really how we wanted to spend our honeymoon. The check-in staff were essentially useless fobbing us off onto the gate staff. At the gate they were friendly but it was too late to be able to sort anything out by that stage. Eventually we were able to swap seats with the person next to my wife after she took pity on us. The actual flight was rather miserable with no entertainment food and uncomfortable seats essentially like doing a long haul flight but on a budget European carrier. Certainly will avoid them in US Airways in the future.,4us-airways,08/04/14,"I have never experienced such rudeness as I did with the US Airways personnel at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. I had booked my redeye flight from PHX to EWR nearly 3 weeks in advance. I chose a window seat. After checking in to my flight at the airport I realized I was assigned a middle seat. Since I had arrived 4 hours before departure I was the first person at my gate. The gate agent was curt. It was almost time to board there was still no gate agent to be found. 80% of my fellow passengers myself included found out through word-of-mouth of a gate change. I grabbed my belongings and ran from A18 to A25 eager to restore my original seat assignment. However I had hardly introduced my situation before the new gate agent cut me off and said ""Sorry no room."" The customer service agent could not have been more indifferent and reluctant to do her job. I went back to my gate where my flight had been delayed more than 2 hours. There was yet another unannounced gate change. Finally it was time to board. Despite sitting in the 13th row I was in the last boarding group and thus was forced to gate-check my bag which now reassured that I would be late to work in the morning. This experience ruined the weekend.",1united-airlines,10/06/14,The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.,1united-airlines,08/06/14,Washington Dulles to San Diego Intl Airport. Flight UA1512. October 25th 2013. The worst experience I have had with ground staff - unhelpful difficult to reach. Flight OK but I would not recommend this airline to anyone and I certainly will not fly UA again.,us-airways,07/04/14,Probably the worst airline I have travelled on in 10 years. Service was bad. Connecting flights didn't connect and uncaring employees. They don't get that it is all about the customer.,2us-airways,06/04/14,Terrible service terrible equipment semi-friendly staff who can't help because of terrible organization. Baggage charges are ridiculous. Check-in procedures worse they have to have attendants at the self check-in. They claim to be the New American Airlines but when you go to check-in they send you to the Disaster that used to be USAir. Planes are out of date. Even the newer ones have very small overheads for carry ons but people take as much as possible on board. Then they cram as many possible on the plane. Flight from Hawaii has no service. Expensive food if you have to buy from them and not worth it. We had short connection and no chance to buy in airport. Only good thing I can say about round trip flight with 6 connections is we made it safely. Next time I fly Southwest.,united-airlines,08/06/14,LHR-IAH-CUN-IAH-LHR. Flew United Airlines they upgraded me to Economy Plus for free due to my disability. I enjoyed my flight. Staff really helpful. Food was alright.,8united-airlines,08/06/14,First flight was cancelled never got any notification that our flight was rescheduled for the following day. Got to the airport they representatives re re-routing the flights were not nice at all. I couldn't believe that there was no discount or free bag check offered. I will never fly united again worst customer service. We were suppose to be in Vegas by 3pm that day. We did not arrive until 3am the next day.,2us-airways,06/04/14,My wife and I live in NC near Wilmington. US Airways is one of the few airlines that fly out of ILM airport so we have flown with them numerous times. My wife flew to Ohio for a two week visit. The return flight as it was listed on the flight itinerary was to fly from Cleveland OH (CLE) to Charlotte NC (CLT) have about an hour lay over and then fly onto ILM. The flight was supposed to be into CLT on flight 1955 and out again on the same flight an hour later. This seemed odd since US Airways typically lands at one end of CLT and has you fly out of another gate all the way across the terminal. We questioned this flight into and out of the same gate when we purchased the tickets when she went to board her flight in ILM to go to CLE and again in CLE when boarding to return. All three times we were told that was accurate. The flight from CLE was delayed due to weather for 35 minutes and landed in CLT about 50 minutes late. People were scrambling to make connections as this was the last flight of the day (about 11 pm). My wife made a comment to one of the flight crew that she was lucky since she just had to stay on the same plane. The staff member told her that plane wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the night. US Airways had changed her flight plans while she was in the air. The flight she had to catch was only 8 gates away but it had already boarded and was pulling away by that time. She was stranded in CLT for the night. I ended up driving the 3.5 hours one way to pick her up to save her from having to sleep in the terminal. I would highly recommend that if you have any options other than US Airways for making flight plans you do it. Even if you have to pay a little extra for a ticket the peace of mind will be worth it.,us-airways,03/04/14,"The second leg of our outbound flight was cancelled. We were given the option of flying the next two booked flights standby or cancelling and applying for a refund. We chose to apply for a refund and the person at the customer service counter said we'd need to wait until our trip was completed. I received an email regarding our outbound flight that I needed to contact customer service because our reservations were ""out of sync."" I spent 25 minutes on hold getting that straightened out and the person told me I should go online and print out our boarding passes. I could only find my husband's flight. I called back and was told that was because I had new confirmation number which the prior person didn't give me. I went back online and found out we were no longer sitting together. I called back again and was told I could pay extra for a premium seat otherwise there was nothing they could do. She told me the gate agent would be â€œhappy to help.â€ù That conversation took an additional 30 minutes. When we got to the airport and I asked about sitting together and the employee was very rude saying she would ""try to get us together for this 20 minute flight."" I explained it was the second leg I was asking about. She got us closer but not together. She could have put us in a â€œpremiumâ€ùseat together but would not without us paying additional money. At no point during this entire encounter did any U.S. Airways employee apologize for these inconveniences or for the conflicting information I have been given.",united-airlines,08/06/14,This was my first and hopefully last time on a US airline. The short 45 minute flight from Dubai to Doha was an ordeal. Draconian security for this flight only terrible old plane unkempt rude flight staff a 2 hour delay with no apologies. Some Americans might rate United Airlines highly maybe because they are used to the generally low quality of most if not all airlines in the United States but for someone used to the superior services of Qatar Emirates Etihad etc this proved to be a really bad experience.,1united-airlines,05/06/14,ORD-DCA and BWI-ORD. Overall the experience was very good. All flights departed and arrived on time and all employees were friendly. The trip was through a tour so the price or value cannot be determined. Security on Monday at O'Hare was very crowded so be sure to allot enough time. Boarding was organized and most bags were checked at the gate because the overhead bins would have been to crowded. The seats on board were very comfortable and recline was decent. The plane was an A319 that has not been reconfigured with the slimline seating. Crew was very nice and efficient and Inwas given an entire can of apple juice. We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others. The flight arrived on time and bags were quick to come out of the carousel. United seems like they are beginning to overcome merger issues now.,8united-airlines,05/06/14,"April 26 FLL-CLE. My friend flew with miles and I flew for $400. Not bad considering that it was booked 3 weeks in advance and during a popular travel time. Check in crew and gate agents at FLL are outstanding. So friendly and willing to help out. The check in crew were smiling and friendly and helped out with checked bag issue. The gate agent was the best I've seen. She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL. We didn't hear the captain inform us about it or speak once during the flight. The flight was completely full. The flight was on a A320 with the new slimline seats. The legroom was adequate for my height of 5' 10"" however the seat was very hard and didn't recline very far. I purchased the wifi and for $5 was a great deal. No music or overhead screens on this plane. Connection through Cleveland was very easy and the airport was very easy to connect through. Flight from CLE to ORD was 60% full and had another great crew. They were very enthusiastic. The flight was operated by a 737-700 with very comfortable seats. Not one person on board purchased the over priced direct TV. Flight arrived on time bags quickly arrived at carousel. Overall United was decent. A bit overpriced but was on time with friendly service.",7us-airways,01/04/14,Travel was a nightmare on our return vacation from Jamaica. I have a daughter with Down Syndrome and needed seating together with my wife and daughters. let's just say they were less than helpful in getting us seating together. When I pointed out that it did not seem like they were sorry about not doing their job they threatened to remove me from the plane. What kind of an airline treats a family traveling on vacation like this. This was only the first leg of the trip when it came to the second leg and catching our connecting flight they could not find our tickets and we missed our connecting flight home.,us-airways,31/03/14,"I have flown over 20 times in my 23 years and never have I experienced any of the problems I had to deal with my first time flying with US Airways. After boarding our flight on time we proceeded to sit on the tarmac for nearly 2 hours. The pilot informed us that there were ""operational"" problems and they were making him turn the plane around to go back to the gate because our flight was cancelled. After the rush of everyone to customer service we proceeded to stand in line for 45 minutes. At that point one of the three agents they had behind the desk decided that would be the best time to grab her book and go on break. The agent who decided to actually do her job put us on a flight to Jacksonville (3 hours from our original destination - Tallahassee). Never once was there an apology or offer to provide meals or anything. I had checked my bag in so I made sure to reiterate to her I needed my bag re-directed. She assured me my bag had been re-directed. We proceeded to sit in the airport for another 4 hours. Our plane to JAX was late so the agent hurried all customers to the plane. Finally we got on the plane and landed in JAX at 10.15 pm. My bag was not there. After waiting in line until 11 pm to speak to an agent about I learned that my bag had never in fact been re-directed and this agent's ""best guess"" was that it was still in DC.",united-airlines,05/06/14,LHR-EWR and back. You do get what you pay for with this airline but they really should do something to improve on the overall quality of their planes and service. The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.,1united-airlines,05/06/14,Newark to London Heathrow 4 June. Found them ok in all areas. Plane very clean drinks brought around regularly. Seat comfortable with plenty of legroom.,10us-airways,30/03/14,Flight from Manchester UK US735 to PHL to BWI on 16th March 2014 by Envoy and First Class service was excellent outbound. Good meal and Envoy was excellent. Return flight from BWI on 28th March cancelled and taken by vehicle to PHL 1 hour 40 mins. Flight US 735 PHL to Manchester UK. Checked in at PHL no problem and the Club lounge very nice per check in at gate confirmed our seats in Envoy. Prior to boarding saw three employees of US Airways access the plane before boarding called. When boarding announced we joined the line to check-in however told that whilst my wife was checked into Envoy I had been bumped back to coach as the flight was full as a person who missed a flight on previous day was being placed into my seat! Re assigned a coach seat despite my request to remain in Envoy. As I asked more questions the reason for my downgrade (despite confirmed and paid for Envoy seat) changed over and over again. Basically I was not provided with the correct reason and was just treated with no respect. As I was pulled from the line much embarrassment to me as people assumed some issue with me as a passenger. My wife confirmed that the three US airline employees were in Envoy. Appalling service and ruined what was outbound a great service. If this is the way they treat passengers than not much hope for the new American brand.,1us-airways,26/03/14,"We flew to St. Maarten an hour late. On the return trip the plane was late to SXM which made it late for us to board. Then the ""push back"" machine did not work and we were stuck on the tarmac making us an hour delayed in leaving SXM. We arrive at Charlotte and had to wait on the tarmac for an hour because there was no gate for us to deplane. The pilot told us that US Airways was holding our connecting flight. We hitched a ride on the airport transport and arrived at our connecting gate barely on time. They closed the door and would not allow us to board. Our connecting plane was not held as the pilot said but left 10 minutes before its scheduled departure. US Air offered us a discount on a hotel since there was not another flight out until the next day. We protested and refused to leave their desk. Finally they gave us a voucher for a hotel. We finally went out on a packed plane and made it to our destination. I will look for any other airline in the future for our trips.",united-airlines,05/06/14,Horrible experience. I made the mistake of booking United for the short 40 minute trip from Doha to Dubai (United has a daily Washington DC-Doha-Dubai flight). Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai. The plane was a tired creaky old B-777. Flight attendants whose average age was nearly 60 were grumpy and rude. Only a stale bagel was served. Definitely one of the worst flight experiences I had ever to endure.,1united-airlines,05/06/14,BOS and MCI and again from BOS to YYT. Overall a below average - average airline. Gate staff and flight attendants can be surly but occasionally a helpful and attentive one can be found. I generally will not fly United unless they are significantly cheaper or have markedly better connections/flight times than everyone else.,5us-airways,26/03/14,FRA-PHL-FRA. Envoy. The new seat is excellent. Food was nicely presented and of good quality. Drinks and wine ok. Entertainment great. FA`S typical American style but they did their best. Both legs on time nothing to complain about. From my point of view a very good experience.,8us-airways,25/03/14,We flew JetBlue to San Juan Puerto Rico - no problems or delay. Coming home through Philadelphia to Richmond VA 3/22/2014 was a disaster for several reasons. U.S. Airlines from San Juan was an Airbus 330 and we waited for 50 minutes on the runway while every puddle jumper took off which made us within 15 minutes to get our 7.15pm flight to Richmond VA. We landed in concourse F and had to get to concourse A and get a transfer bus. No help from the airline ground staff to expedite or help us. They seem oblivious to our situation and offered no help. They were rude and non caring.,united-airlines,05/06/14,LAX to Quebec City Canada. May 22 and 28 2014: What a nightmare full of delays and lack of updated information so I a 77 year old grandmother had to run from one end of an airport to the other to catch a plane sat in airports for many wasted precious travel hours. The movies on board were horrible choices. I hope to never need to fly United again in my life. And I have done a LOT of traveling.,1united-airlines,04/06/14,We travelled to NY 28/5/14 with United Airlines and from the minute we went to check in desk we where treated with courtesy. The staff were both friendly and helpful. Once on the plane we again had the same experience. The food was ok and served hot. The choice of films etc was great and to have the chance to charge your devices was very handy. On our return we were due to fly with a different airline but we missed our flights. The other airline couldn't care less and said we would need to pay $1300 each to get home. We decided to go over to the United desk to see if they could offer any help. They went above and beyond to help us get on another flight with a different company for no charge.,10us-airways,24/03/14,We were flying from Jamaica to Nashville. We arrived at our connecting flight 20 prior to departure and the had given our seats away to standby customers and shut the door. We couldn't get another flight for 2 days.,us-airways,24/03/14,The express jets with no first class seats need to be taken out of service - these planes are entirely too small in poor shape and if anything ever happened there is no way to move to get out. US Air flight attendants (not all ) but many have the personality of a rock - they need education on customer satisfaction and customer service they need to understand that the service they provide is what matters most. And do you think they could offer a free bag of peanuts? Delta does! Get with the times US air - you are outdated.,5us-airways,24/03/14,"Had made reservation early January for flight to Phoenix on 2/26/14. Boarded on time but then proceeded to sit on tarmac for 2 hrs. Flight was then cancelled due to ""mechanical problems"". They gave us along with 175 other passengers a business card with an 800# to call. After trying for almost an hour I was finally connected and given a flight out the next day. No offer of hotel meals or anything else. I then went to customer service at airport who booked me to Philly (yes Philly). With a long layover and then to Phoenix. Arrived at 10:15pm rather than the 8:15am I was originally scheduled for. Customer services is absolutely horrible. Return flight 2 weeks later was also cancelled supposedly due to weather. No offer of help whatsoever. Will never fly US Air again.",1united-airlines,04/06/14,"May 21 Denver to Los Angeles: The A320 was having mechanical problems which delayed departure by over an hour. Meantime a violent thunderstorm/tornado warning further delayed departure until we were 2.5 hours late leaving. Needless to say our connection to Hilo HI was way gone before we arrived. We were bumped from one customer service desk to another. The line at Gate 71 never moved for an hour. Children were tired and screaming while the customer service reps mumbled useless statements waited for phone returns and after an hour declared we had no hotel or meal compensation because DIA coded the departure as late due to ""weather"". If the plane had been ready at departure time there would have been no delay. The rude and helpless reception at Los Angeles resulted in several of us sleeping in the airport all night missing a full day of reserved vacation time a change in destination from Hilo to Kona a change in car rental arrangements and a long drive around the island instead of 30 miles as originally planned. The scene at the customer service desk was hellish and I was prepared to see any one of the passengers leap across the counter at the inept and uncaring mumbling representatives. I will never travel on United again.",1united-airlines,04/06/14,June 3 EWR-SFO Economy on a new 737-900. We departed two hours late due to a storm and flight crew distributed water and was generally helpful and good humored. These planes offer standard economy seating not as comfortable as other planes United flies. Bathrooms are extremely tiny and cramped. As opposed to a wide variety of seatback entertainment on UA's 757s from JFK to California this new 737-900 offer no entertainment options at all a major disappointment on such a long flight. These planes may be perfect for a 1-2 hour trip but not for a transcontinental journey.,2us-airways,21/03/14,My entire trip was horrible. I am active duty military with both feet injured and surgery boots on. I asked for wheelchair assistance round trip. Starting in LAX the curbside check in guy was extremely rude he was on his phone and when asked for a wheelchair the man looked me up and down and asked what was wrong with me. I got through security and was wheeled to my gate the lady who wheeled me there assured me someone would push me to my airplane. When they started to board they forgot about me and had people climbing over me finally someone saw me and wheeled me half way and left me to talk to a group of passengers in front of me. Once they finished they came back and began pushing me to the airplane. Once I landed In Charlotte the flight attendant was extremely helpful getting me off the plane however once I got off the experience was even worse so many rude people asking can I walk because they need the wheelchair for people seeing I am in two medical boots. I informed them that I was unable to walk long distance so they took my wheelchair and told me to walk to the closest seat so they could take mine! This was a horrible experience and I will never travel with US Airways again.,us-airways,17/03/14,Firstly when will US Airways get new planes. We fly Business Class cross country with no music or entertainment of any kind. Really they can't play a little music. The seats are so old and pushed close together if the people in front recline back we can't stand up. If you're in the back row your seat doesn't recline back at all. Food is sometimes just not edible once we were sitting in the last row and were informed they had run out of food before they got to us. I asked if we could get a meal from the coach section they said no. They found some cheese and crackers for us. The crew tries to be accommodating but they don't have much to work with. All that aside it's the old planes that upset me just update the fleet please.,2us-airways,07/03/14,MAN-PHL. The new seat is excellent - so much better than the BA sardine tin. Food was nicely presented and of good quality. Drinks free-flowing though wine selection limited. Easy going flight attendants who worked hard and interacted well with passengers. A most enjoyable experience - much better than the BA equivalent in every way and cheaper.,10united-airlines,03/06/14,London LHR - Newark EWR. Boeing 757-200 quite old and it was visible everywhere as cabin looked shabby. Cabin crew ok but limited their service to distributing food collecting trays and that's it. Small portions paid alcoholic drinks torn inflight magazine. Nothing special there are much better options on this route.,5united-airlines,02/06/14,We flew UA893 SFO to ICN on B747 on 29th May 2014. Flight was delayed 2 times - captain rejected the first plane due to technical issue and the replaced plane returned to gate after found technical glitch while taxiing. Overall almost 5 hours delay. The captain tried his best to kept us updated on the delays. Instruction of allowing passengers to leave the plane during the delay was not clear resulted in passenger wandering around the bridge area. Cabin crew changed after the 2nd delay which turned out to be a plus point to us. Original crew serving the upper deck was grumpy the replacement crew (original crew gone probably due to extended hour) was fantastic provided one of the better quality service to a almost fully filled business class cabin. The plane was old and there was sign of dirt especially around the edges of the window frame. Seat itself was comfortable. It is weird to see UA cramping 2-4-2 seat in business class. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment was average. For the price paid UA has exceeded our expectation.,8us-airways,07/03/14,Vancouver to Phoenix Feb 27 return Mar 2. On time both ways pleasant service no problems. One cart service per leg. Frequent updates from the flight deck. No mess no fuss.,7us-airways,07/03/14,LGA to IAH with connection at Charlotte on March 1st. Both flights departed on-time and arrived early. Check-in boarding went very smooth and I managed to get exit seats on both flights. Cabin crew professional. Only negative point was that the cabin looked tired and not very clean. Hopefully their aircraft's will be refurbished as they merge with AA.,8united-airlines,29/05/14,ORD to LHR in a fully refurbished 767-300ER. Efficient and helpful check in. Nice lounge was very busy but had nice atmosphere and nice bar tenders. Boarding efficient. Very good seating notwithstanding 6 abreast and good cabin ambience. Some pairs of seats are backwards facing but not a big issue. Professional and helpful crew who were well organised attentive and efficient - a real surprise. Very good choice of wines and OK food but nice desert and very good cheese plate. Seat in sleeping position was good and nice large pillow. Big screen noise reduction earphones and OK programming with mostly American content. Many language options. Luggage return quick. Overall very impressed and would consider better than transatlantic AC and LH flights taken in previous 3 weeks.,10united-airlines,28/05/14,Six hour delay from San Antonio to Houston. I could have driven there and back. The flight crew and gate staff were so rude! No recompense whatsoever. Not even an apology to the over two hundred passengers. My first time to fly with United and my last.,1us-airways,06/03/14,"My husband and I travel to Belize and Mexico 2-3 times per year with relatively little issues. I have never in my entire 42 years had such a horrible experience as I had on 21st Feb with US Airways. Our flight departed Pittsburgh at 5.25 am with no issues and we were to switch planes in Philadelphia to pick up flight #815 to complete our trip to Cancun with a 10.49 am. arrival. There was heavy fog in Philadelphia so we circled the airport for some time before being diverted to Harrisburg. Sat on the tarmac in Harrisburg for several hours with no one telling anyone anything. Around 10 am they finally taxied us to the airport and let everyone deplane. After standing in line for more than an hour a staff member told us we needed to grab our bags and get on a bus as they were going to drive us 2 hrs to Harrisburg. Arrived at the very end of the drop off zone at the Philadelphia airport at 2 pm had no idea where we were or what we were supposed to do. We managed to beg a TSA agent who hustled us through security and we ran to the gate. Got to the gate just after it pushed off so we missed the flight. An hour later we found out that not only were we not put on the next flight we couldn't even get a flight until 10 am the next day. We asked if because we missed an entire day of vacation and were out the additional cost of a hotel as well as the cost of having to reschedule all of our transportation arrangements at our final destination if we could switch our return flights from Friday to Saturday and we were told ""Of course you just have to pay the change fees"". Any amount of basic common courtesy would have at least made some kind of difference in this entire situation.",1us-airways,05/03/14,March 2014: My flight from Washington DC to California had a lay over in Phoenix AZ. My 9.30 pm connecting flight got delayed then cancelled due to rain. However they didn't tell us this information until a long time after it already showed up online as flight being cancelled. The rude customer service staff at the airport were rescheduling probably 150+ flights told us that there were no hotels available or lounges. They did not give us any water food (restaurants were all closed) or blankets. We sat in the cold airport all night (over 11 hours). We were not allowed to get to our luggage unless we had medication we had to take. I fly a lot but this is my first and last time flying US Airways. I have never experienced such disorganization inept and rude customer service representatives and overall horrible service.,united-airlines,28/05/14,1st class UA 926 LHR-EWR in 3 cabin 767. Check in with Biz class pax long line. Indifferent contract staff were clueless regarding arrival facilities at EWR. Ditto for gate agents. Flight attendant told me to check with transfer desk at EWR after clearing customs. Transfer agent told me that there were no arrival facilities unless continuing on with UA. Huh at a UA hub for 1st class? I noticed that meal served in 1st was the same as in Biz albeit with better china. Altogether a thoroughly mediocre experience for a huge premium price. There are many better ways to cross the pond - especially those of us needing to freshen up for post arrival meetings.,3united-airlines,27/05/14,ORD-AMS on a clapped out Boeing 767 which showed its age. The worst experience on this flight were the cabin crew. The most unfriendly lazy rude and uninterested crew I have ever flown with. Shouting at passengers to close the overhead lockers refusing to close these themselves. This is one of their safety duties! The service was slow no peanuts/snacks with the drinks. Dinner was awful cold by the time I was served and totally inadequate for a 7 hr flight. Beer/wine are for sale only and when I asked for a soft drink they offered water only! A second request for a soft drink was rudely refused. Inflight entertainment was terrible small screens and all channels started without any announcement so by the time you wanted to watch anything films were already running for 30 mins. I am a Star alliance Gold member and have flown more than most people but this flight was by far the worst I have ever experienced. No more United for me!,1us-airways,05/03/14,PHX-JFK return connecting to AA international flight in JFK. Both US flights on time and exactly as expected. Both flights on time service (drink run) multiple times through each flight. Wish they would update the announcement to delete the star alliance portion as they will be exiting EOM. Also feel the onboard announcement for the credit card is tired and should be discontinued.,8us-airways,04/03/14,I recently booked a return flight from LAX to Charlotte. I paid top rate as it was an emergency. Nothing about this airlines wants you to use it again. On my return flight I paid extra to sit in an aisle seat in a designated area. I had hoped the extra $$'s would at least give more space but no such thing. At the last minute they added people from other delayed flights. They put a woman with an infant in the seat next to me and someone with an infant behind me. There were plenty of single last-minute passengers they could have put in these seats but no they put them where we all paid extra to sit. I was practically pushed out of my seat during the entire 5 hours by a fidgeting Mom and infant. Both infants cried non stop for 75% of the trip.,1united-airlines,27/05/14,I booked a 5 day weekend from Thursday to Tuesday. My flight was cancelled while I was on my way to the Airport. I had to pay for a taxi to and from the airport and return the next day at 4am for a 6am flight. My original flight was a 2 hour direct flight from Newark to Atlanta but the rescheduled flight had a layover in Chicago. I arrived in Atlanta at 12pm. I could have leave with that but I could not believe that my return flight was cancelled and this time without a notice. I only found out because I couldn't print my boarding pass. I was rescheduled on a flight to LaGuardia and because the agent did not completed the booking I missed the flight and had to be put on another flight 3 hours later. I got to the airport at 5.45pm and did not take off until 10.53pm for a 2 hour flight. I am still waiting for an explanation for cancelling both flights.,1united-airlines,27/05/14,Louisville - Houston - Denver - Reno. All flights on time. Plenty of drink runs on all flights. Snack boxes for purchase but I did not try any. All the staff were friendly except for a grumpy check-in clerk at Louisville. My check-in bag was 54.5 lbs so was asked to remove an item. I pulled out one slipper and that dropped the weight down to 54 lbs and that was acceptable according to the clerk. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno. Everything went like clockwork so no complaints and my luggage arrived safely minus the slipper I had to take out in Louisville.,9us-airways,04/03/14,LAX-PHX-PDX and return last week. All 4 flights departed and arrived relatively on-time all legs on A321 aircraft. Staff were friendly and attentive but not quite as polished as UA/DL. Star Gold gets you zone 1 boarding which is nice - but that will go away at the end of March as they leave Star Alliance and switch to oneWorld. IFE non-existent but fine for short hauls. They got me from point to point with no frills.,6us-airways,04/03/14,Booked our flight in August 2013 for Toronto to Philadelphia on Feb 15 2014 06.45. Checked our flight status the day before our flight. Everything is good but noticed 2 flights to Philly scheduled at same time. Again I checked flight status before going to bed the night before flight. Everything was good. Woke up early (2am) next morning to prepare to go to Toronto airport. Checked flight status one more time. Our flight is cancelled but other flight to is still a go. Got to airport 2.5 hours before flight time. US Airways kiosk would only printout a baggage receipt no boarding pass. Talked with US Airways rep who said the only flight to Philly was overbooked. Got stand-by boarding passes and waited at the gate for a miracle to happen. Five minutes before our flight was to board we received seats. We somehow managed to make it to our Philly connecting flight and on to our Puerto Rican cruise. If at all possible I will not fly US Airways again!,united-airlines,27/05/14,May 17th from Toronto to Cancun with a connection in Houston. The plane had a mechanical problem half way to Houston and had to land in Memphis. More than 100 people were asked to stay at Memphis airport and wait for another plane to come. We waited for 7 hours from 1.30 to 8.30. The airport staff first said that the plane would come at 7.30 and later announced that it would be one hour late. All stores in Memphis airport closed around 6.30 and we were all starving. United did at least bring some food for us in this situation. We missed our connecting flight and had to call our hotel and pick-up shuttle to explain the situation. We eventually arrived at Houston around 11pm. There were only 2 people at Houston to help the customers arrange hotels and airport shuttles and they worked extremely inefficiently since they didn't seem to know what to do. In the end it took them 3 hours to get everyone arranged. Up to this point I am totally disappointed with United Airline. I'd rather pay a little more to get a better service. This is my first time flying with United and shall be the last.,1united-airlines,26/05/14,"Long story short they kept finding reasons to delay and cancel my flights and those of the people around me. It was chaos and passengers all around were complaining of their own horror stories with United. I spent the night in a Chicago airport (admittedly a large part of my nightmare was O'Hare airport) and no one who worked there for United seemed to care that I needed a flight out because they were so overwhelmed with the number of flights that were canceled and people that needed to be rebooked. They didn't give me a hotel room because the problem was due to ""weather"" but that was simply not true. They told us on the plane that we boarded that we needed to go back to the airport because the crew had overworked their permitted number of hours and they had no other crew to replace them with. I told them I would literally take any flight that would get me out of that city and the flight I did get was canceled within a few hours of booking it. I went back to customer service and I felt like I was a bother to them for simply needing a way out of there to avoid sleeping on their floors again. It was like it was normal for them to have upset customers and the people like me who didn't give them a hard time were more likely to messed about.",1us-airways,04/03/14,I flew from Brussels (Belgium) to Fort Lauderdale and back on 16th Feb and 24th. I was supposed to take connecting flights via Philadelphia and Charlotte on both trips. I actually missed my first connection on my way to FLL due to the long security lines the customs control and the baggage re-checking in PHL. I arrived just a few minutes after my flight to CLT had closed and a very rude lady didn't want to let me board the plane even though it was still sitting at the gate. She directed me to the customer service desk in a rude manner. I still made it to FLL by boarding a direct flight in the evening thanks to the professional US Airways customer service lady that rebooked me straight away. I didn't have any problems with my connecting flights on my way back to Brussels. US Airways have poor cabin crew service very limited in-flight entertainment (operated by old Boeing 767s). I have read many reviews about this airline before flying with them and I was expecting to have some problems. I would not recommend this airline to someone traveling in the future.,2us-airways,25/02/14,Yesterday morning we began our return flight to central New York from a lovely vacation in Orlando. We boarded the first leg to Philadelphia without incident around 7.30 am. As we were preparing to land a crew member announced that Philadelphia was fogged in and not allowing any craft to land or take off. After 30 minutes it was announced that the plane was being diverted to Richmond for refuelling. An uneventful 45-minute flight and then it was announced that there was some trouble refuelling. Another hour on the tarmac and we took off for Philly. Upon landing we made our way to the regional terminal to continue our trip to Ithaca which was still posted as â€˜on time. The boarding was switched from gate to gate 3 times. Our departure time was changed twice and finally the flight cancelled. We stood in line at a US Airways gate and told to go to a service desk for help. We stood in line a long line for another 30 minutes at the service desk to be met by a staff member who told us that she could get us standby on a flight Monday (this was Friday at 3 pm.). The customer service representative offered nothing other than a 3 day wait. There were many things that could have been done to make the experience right. Ground transportation offer of a hotel a little compassion but what we got was nothing no help at all. We will not fly US Airways again.,united-airlines,26/05/14,IAH to YYC on Boeing 737-800. Smooth check-in. Organized boarding. Clean aircraft decent seat and legroom. Pro-active crew and multiple offerings of beverages. Bags on baggage belt by the time I arrived there.,9united-airlines,25/05/14,BOS-IAH. I was traveling with my family for holiday from BOS-LAX via IAH. My son is severely allergic to nuts and we always carry Epipen with us. We informed United customer service agent in advance about the allergy they made a note in system and advised us to inform the crew on board. When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement. After take off they did announce in so low volume that no one really could hear anything. More than 3 million people in the United States report being allergic to peanuts tree nuts or both. I would like to warn those people in advance about the United Nut Policy.,3us-airways,25/02/14,"This review is based on the first and only experience with US Airways. I usually fly 4-6 times per year and would not hold the airline responsible for weather related delays. Unfortunately the airline is not prepared to handle emergencies of any kind. I was supposed to fly February 14 to Costa Rica flight was cancelled as I was proceeding to board due to ""mechanical issues"" rescheduled to Sunday. I lost 3 days of vacation without reimbursement. Coming back on February 23rd my connecting flight from Costa Rica was delayed by 30 minutes. The airline refused to accommodate or even hold the connecting flight. I had to go through Customs recheck the bag and run to anther terminal all under 45 minutes. I arrived at the gate 10 minutes before scheduled departure time panting only to find that my seat was given up to someone else and was I rebooked to the following morning. The Customer Service at US Airways handed me a number for the hotel very nonchalant since it was the end of her shift and she was ready to head home. I on the other hand paid for the cab checked into a hotel at my own expense. Customer service is completely lacking.",us-airways,24/02/14,I travel a lot for work and always take Southwest. I live in AZ and usually have to fly to east coast / Midwest during bad weather and have never had an issue with delays or the staff and they give you snacks. This time I had to fly using US going to NY and the day of my flight leaving (2/21/14) the weather was warmer just a little rain and some fog. Every other flight was on time but US. A flight that was to leave at 4.30 and was now not leaving until 8. Horrible service.,us-airways,24/02/14,I recently flew on February 15th from Boston to Providenciales (Turks and Caicos). I found this airline to be good on time boarding staff were very good. They came around with beverage service and then tea and coffee about an hour before landing in Turks. Coming back to Boston yesterday was a disaster I know it's school vacation week but the service at Providenciales Airport was extremely slow almost causing us to miss our flight to Boston. The service onboard yesterday's flight to Boston was minimal. They only came around with beverage service once. No service for tea and coffee. It was though a quick flight and the pilot made up travel time in the air after our brief 1 hour delay leaving Turks and Caicos.,6united-airlines,25/05/14,EWR-PVG on a 777-200. Economy Plus exit window seat. Was able to get this seat without paying for it due to a bug in the online seat map (otherwise it would be an extra $192). Overall it was a satisfying flight given I only paid a little above 600 dollars for this non-stop flight which would usually be over 900. The food was standard but not very adequate. There were friendly flight attendants but some were very rude and indifferent. Entertainment was ok but the system was sluggish. The headset did not work but I was able to use my own earphones. Lavatories were not very well maintained and I didn't see any flight attendant clean it during the entire flight. However all these negative aspects were overpowered by the price and the free exit window seat. Would definitely fly them again.,6united-airlines,24/05/14,All week long flying with our three year old we have preboarded the planes. Well upon boarding a flight that need I say arrived two hours late with United we were told to get in the back of the line with her as they have voided the children board first policy as of this weekend. He was rude about telling us and made it embarrassing as if we were doing something so wrong we were doing what we are used to doing not to mention we didn't just try to be the very first we actually got in line up 2 just because we weren't in any hurry to board. After all we all leave at the same time right? After waiting almost 4 hours at the airport with a toddler because of a delayed flight that's not how to really brighten someone's day and treat them. Maybe if you want to change a policy like that again and be butts about it at the gate be sure everyone is aware of your new stupid rule!,5us-airways,24/02/14,I flew US Airways on a round-trip from Birmingham to Denver. Both flights were cancelled or delayed for several hours. When trying to change my flight they put me as a second priority and were incredibly rude to me. I will never use this airline again and I strongly advise everyone else not to use it.,us-airways,24/02/14,We flew from PHL to St. Thomas and back on US Air on Feb 15 and returned on Feb 20. We paid extra for what we thought was economy plus but there was no more leg room than in coach. Of course US Air has no inflight entertainment. There was not enough food for purchase on the way down. Flight attendants urged us to complain to US Air on the net about it. Flight attendants were great and very apologetic about the lack of food. On the return flight we were about 3 hours late due to a mechanical problem. I fly United Delta Virgin America Jet Blue and US Air a decent amount. No question that Virgin is by far the best followed by JetBlue. Of the remaining 3 Delta is better than the other two with US Air on the very bottom of the list.,2united-airlines,24/05/14,"After having a confirmed reservation to Buenos Aires in first class for three months before the flight for which I used miles - I'm a million mile plus flyer - I was bumped from first class and sent back to row 30 (on a 767) because United had oversold the flight and other passengers had paid more money for their tickets (not used miles). The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have. A deal should be a deal or the airline should warn people in advance that their accumulated miles which they tout as being very valuable are really not so valuable and can become worthless if the airline chooses. When I complained after the flight United's response was essentially ""too bad"".",1us-airways,20/02/14,BTV to PHL to CDG and return Airbus A330/200 on the long haul. Despite snowstorm at BTV departure was only 25 minute delayed remainder of flights on time departed CDG earlier than scheduled. Business class on the A330 Envoy seating. Clean cabin friendly professional crew. Envoy suites were excellent quiet and comfortable IFE worked great. Food service was excellent nice menu entrees were delivered almost too hot to eat. Ground crews at both ends were friendly and helpful our luggage beat us to the carousel both times. Boarding area at CDG is a little drab could use a little facelift.,10us-airways,20/02/14,Flew Manchester UK to Philadelphia and then on to Miami return - Economy. Very good experience on all 4 flights. All flights left on time and either arrived on time or early. US Airways use A330 wide body from Manchester to Philadelphia with 2-4-2 seating which is great for couples as you can easily get 2 seats together. US airways website lets you choose your seats as soon as you book for free unlike lots of the other major airlines (e.g. BA) which charge economy class to pre book seats. Plenty of leg room and space around seats. Great inflight entertainment on Manchester to Philadelphia leg with personal video screen and on demand movies TV and games. Lots of films to choose from. Food ok - usual airline offering. No better or worse than all the rest. Soft drinks tea and coffee are free throughout the flight. Free wine with meal but there is a charge after that plus there is a charge for other alcoholic drinks. Staff attentive and efficient. Flight from Philadelphia to Miami on A321 - lots of leg room but no IFE - only a couple of hours so no problem. No charge for soft drinks/tea/coffee but there is a charge for food or alcohol. All in all a good experience - would always use US airways from Manchester to the US rather than American BA United or Delta as IFE superior and they use wide body aircraft. Immigration/customs and change of planes in Philadelphia is easy and quick.,10united-airlines,24/05/14,This experience has been disgusting. I was flying from Newark NJ to London to grab a connecting flight to get to Dublin. The original flight was delayed 3 hours which wouldn't be so bad if someone would have properly advised us about the following connection. Due to the total lack of communication I proceeded to miss my connecting flight because United failed to give me the information I needed to make it on time. I will never fly with this airline again.,1united-airlines,24/05/14,"Flew out of SFO an hour and a half late. Got to Houston only to find out my flight to Huntsville had been cancelled. I go to the ""customer service"" desk to be put on another flight. The only one she says is available is the 4 o clock flight the next day but I can get on standby for the 10:30 am flight. I ask her if I'll get reimbursed for the hotel room I'll have to get. She says United doesn't reimburse for weather and then tells me I won't be able to find a hotel room because there is a conference in Houston and there are no hotel rooms available but I can sleep in the airport. She also complains to me that everyone is taking it out on them and it's not fair. I proceed to tell her it's also not fair that my flight was cancelled and that they won't reimburse me for a hotel room or food or taxi fare. When I went back through security I was told I was not able to re-enter the airport because my flight wasn't until the next day. I ended up finding a hotel room and thanks to my mom calling travelocity I got on the 1030am flight. I ended up cancelling my flight back to SFO on United and booked it with American.",2us-airways,20/02/14,"We were booked from LAX to CLT. Flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. We were rebooked out of a different airport. No transportation costs were provided or refunded. We had preferred seats on our first flight reserved and confirmed but then when rebooked we were assigned middle seats. Even though there were other seats available US Airways refused to give us other seats even with Star Gold. status. Inflight crew were yelling at passengers getting on board about the carry ons we were questioned from FA about our carry ons even though we only had 1 backpack each. One drink service on a 4 hours flight. Flight crew decided to chat loudly in the back galley on this red eye flight. I hope that American Airlines doesn't adopt the US Airways policy of ""useless"" air.",2us-airways,17/02/14,As an EP with American flew US Airways from TPA to PHL on 1/10/2014. The seats are terrible American offers free food and drinks to their Elite Passengers but US Airways does not. As an EP with American for 10 years this is one of the worst airline that American merged with. US /American CEO Doug Parker needs to take care of AA Elite Passengers or they will fly United or Delta.,1united-airlines,23/05/14,I really was disappointed. Leaving Milwaukee no flight crew. One and a half hours late leaving stand in line for two hours to get connecting flight changed airplane waiting for me to board. This was leaving Milwaukee for Houston. Coming home leave Florida great. Get to Chicago no crew finally board plane wrong crew and asked us to get off the plane. Wait for right crew to get there held up in Milwaukee. Get on plane 1.5 hours late taxi back to terminal plane over heating. Get this fixed so we have no air conditioning in plane sweat and over heat to go to Milwaukee. What is the problem. Don't think I ever want to fly United again if this is the normal procedure.,1united-airlines,23/05/14,"Seattle-San Francisco/San Francisco-Sydney-Perth. The departure staff were some of the rudest uncooperative staff we have had to deal with. Having stood in ""row 5"" to board and submitting our boarding passes we were told our hand luggage had to be put in the hold as the overhead lockers were full. This was very unsatisfactory as we were ticketed through to Perth. There was no checking of legal size of cabin bags. We saw many oversize bags go aboard including a musical instrument case at least 4 foot long. People putting their second piece in overheads instead of at their feet. If this was policed there would have been room for all legal sized bags. As we are aged 75 and 77 we had medicine required to be taken on the 27 hour journey. After removing medicine we allowed bags to be placed in hold. As the plane was about to leave gate we realized our passports were in our hand luggage. On approaching the head stewardess and the captain and explaining we would be unable to leave USA until passports were returned. Only through the captains orders our hand luggage was unloaded and brought up to the cabin. Full marks to the captain he placed one bag in the cockpit and the head stewardess rearranged some other bags for the second one. This delayed departure by 15 minutes due to the incompetent staff at boarding gate not listening to where we were going. San Francisco to Sydney was poor service poor food no drinks unless you purchased them. Qantas flight Sydney to Perth only a 4 hour flight and free drinks with meal and the offer of second one .",2united-airlines,21/05/14,"Rome to Newark (EWR) in Business First departing at 9:50 a.m. We were lucky that we could use the miles we had accrued with the United Mileage Plus card for this trip and were very happy with the flight. United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane. All in all a great flight.",9us-airways,17/02/14,"Flew from Providence to Charlotte. Going in I was very optimistic that everything was going to be fine and we would land in St. Kitts the same day. I was wrong. When we got to the gate we were kindly informed that our flight had been delayed 4 hours because the ""crew needed more rest."" They also informed us that we were going to miss our connecting flight to St Kitts from Charlotte and that we wouldn't be able to catch a flight until next Friday to St. Kitts as they have very limited booking. After switching to another airline entirely we got a flight to St. Kitts the next day and we were on our way. Once on the U.S. Airways flight to Charlotte the captain informed us that they ""knew the flight would be delayed the night before."" If U.S. Airways had informed us the night before instead of a half an hour before our flight was supposed to leave then we might've been able to get another flight to connect to the flight to St. Kitts. This has been by far the worst performance of customer experience I've ever seen.",united-airlines,21/05/14,Flew a 747-400 from Chicago to Hong Kong. The economy seats were horrible. They were extremely small. The seats were so bad I stood for over 5 hours during the flight.,2united-airlines,21/05/14,Flew YEG to Amsterdam through Houston return in business first. Flight crew on all flights were great very professional and hard working. The one complaint was the food Tasteless overcook and very little variety. Also cabin could be kept a little tidier. Other than that good flights.,7us-airways,17/02/14,Had a flight out of JFK during a snow storm. Our flight was canceled after waiting through 3 different mechanical issues and 11 hours. We boarded the same plane 2 separate times over 8 hours and were offered 1 glass of water. My trip home was delayed 24 hours with no hotel voucher given causing me to miss a day of work. US Airways offered $100 voucher for my troubles! I would have been ok with a weather delay considering the snow storm but mechanical? 3 on the same plane? Then continued mechanical delays on three other planes through connecting flights.,us-airways,13/02/14,Flew from Boise to Indianapolis via Phoenix. All flights left and arrived punctually. Attentive flight attendant. Good food service. Good selection of drinks. Cabin spacious with light colored furnishings - Airbus 320. Seat comfortable. Quick boarding and disembarkation. Regular announcements by pilot about weather on route. Overall very impressive.,9united-airlines,20/05/14,"IAH-SFO on A319 and SFO-IAH on B787. Comparing the 2 legs with 2 different aircraft is hard. I would look forward to more planes look like the Dreamliner in regards to age and cleanness. I have no complaints but just general concerns. Economy Plus is just the more legroom nothing more nothing less. It's the small things that can add up a pillow here and tiny bag of peanuts there and lets say a complementary cocktail on longer flights in Eco Plus to stand up to the ""Premium Eco Class"" and to be ""Eco Plus friendly. I miss the work hard-fly right slogan.",6united-airlines,19/05/14,Boeing 777 SYD-LAX LAX-SFO SFO-SYD. Service was professional Food surprisingly good. IFE very good. Boeing 777 legroom is good. I'm not crazy on these new economy seats on United when the seat recline the seat base moves forward. This is not good for the back and make sleeping less comfortable. Altogether very good experience plus receiving 100% miles even though the ticket was discounted.,8us-airways,10/02/14,"Flight from FLL to CLT. (2 times A320 and 737) Flight was on time crew friendly. Plane extremely uncomfortable. I am average male 5'10"" 150lb. No legroom seats narrow and short. I hope US Airways works on pax comfort in the future.",4us-airways,07/02/14,TPA-PHL-Rome over Christmas. Treated myself to 1st/Biz to Europe but took Economy back. Unpleasantly surprised by the rushed unfriendly service in first cabin to Europe. there weren't that many flight attendants (mostly men) and they were all in a hurry and don't seem to like their jobs much. The new lie-flat bed was great though small - bigger folks beware. Fook was OK. was glad I didn't bother to spring for biz class on way back. Economy is OK.,7united-airlines,18/05/14,Completely unreasonable and unwilling to help customers. Do not take United if you want any kind of decent customer service friendliness of staff or bearable trip. The woman behind the counter at check in seemed to feel a need to give me attitude for no apparent reason. Even at a small airport like in Ithaca NY United was unable to accommodate me.,1united-airlines,17/05/14,Had to fly United as it was the only one flying in at out at the times I needed. Flight from DEN-YXE was delayed twice on the way out. Then flying from YXE-DEN we sat in a small hot plane sweating for over an 1.5 hours after landing because Customs wasn't open for business yet and we weren't allowed off the plane. It is a daily flight so they should know when customs opens? Transfer from DEN-EUG had no gate until 2 hours prior which changed 2 times missed the flight because the last change was 20 minutes prior. Next flight out was 10 hours later. Unless you are person that likes sitting in Airports for days and enjoys wasting time and money this airline is an extreme last resort!,1us-airways,28/01/14,Was traveling from DC to Hartford on 1/24/14. Flight to DC was coming from Jacksonville FLA - no weather problems in either JAX/DC/CT. The DC departure to CT was over 2 hours late. To make matters worse the plane from DC to Hartford bumped anyone off sitting in rows 19 and beyond. Imagine waiting to board a plane and then due to your seat # - told you couldn't board but that there was another flight 6 hours later!,2us-airways,23/01/14,We used a travel agency to book our flight Fresno to Mexico City. Our seating was confirmed we paid extra for selecting our seats. At check-in we were told that we would be charged $25 for using a 27 inch suitcase instead of a 21 inch suitcase. Then they wanted to charge us another $95 for being 6 pounds over in weight. We had to run and buy a backpack for the items we took out. Then asked to see our passports and told our return flight was changed from the afternoon to early morning and we: my husband and 2 daughters were scattered all over the plane. I was told they could change the seating in Mexico on our return flight. In Mexico City on our return home to Fresno CA arrived at the airport asked about changing back our seating to the original seating arrangement everyone said they could not help me. They only changed my seating to sit next to my husband. When they rescheduled our flight our arrival time in Phoenix was at 11am and or boarding time to Fresno was at 11.20 am. and when I voiced this concern all I was told was that we had better run.,united-airlines,17/05/14,Would never fly with United Airlines again we boarded the plane back from Florida to Newark to fly on to the UK to be greeted by miserable crew. This continued the whole of the flight. Anything asked of them seemed too much trouble food was awful and was practically thrown at us. Seating was so uncomfortable cramped together but the worst part was as we were coming into land at Newark the pilot overshot the runway had to pull back up very fast and circle to try again it all happened so fast - it was so scary but not one of the crew checked on any of us passengers one lady got up to be sick in the toilet - all we had was a female cabin crew shouting for her to get out of the toilet and sit down. A child around 9 yrs of age was beside himself but still no one came to check on us. We got down safely the second time after being told they were moving to another runway. But even after the plane got down safely not one of the crew came to see if anyone needed any help. The passengers are supposed to come first but in this instance none of us were. Wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone and will never fly with them again.,1us-airways,21/01/14,Took my twin 6 year olds and 2 year old to Disney from Boston with a stop in Charlotte NC. We were delayed by a late plane that then had to be de-iced. An hour and 1/2 after our scheduled departure I asked a crew member for some milk for my baby's bottle. The elder of the 2 grouchy crew members said we don't have milk! The 2 year old screamed for most of the flight. We had a connecting flight in Charlotte due to leave 5 mins before our new arrival time. No information was given to anyone. We finally get to our new gate (B8 Charlotte about 7pm on 1/18/14). We were treated like misbehaved school children. They put us in 4 seats that were spread across the plane. I was met with a glare and an attitude. Onboard was not much better. Service and attitude poor across the board with this airline.,us-airways,21/01/14,We took US Airways flights earlier this month ORD-CLT-ILM round trip. Pretty happy with them. Short flightsâ€_but check-in was a pleasure (we got stuck overnight Chicago due to a late connecting flight and bad weather and US airways gave us a voucher for a very reduced rate at a local hotel and re-scheduled us for the next day - no charge. Check-in staff at ORD and ILM excellent particularly ORD where they spent a lot of time trying to find alternatives for us no luck - terrible weather and flights beyond full. Aircraft's have done some hard work but still pretty comfortable - leather seats enough legroom. Cabin crews were helpful and friendly - regardless of age.,9united-airlines,17/05/14,MKE-ORD-SFO and back. The first flight was delayed so we missed connection. Our connection was supposed to be a nice 777 but we missed it. Thankfully they said our flight was delayed because of maintenance problems so they gave a hotel and food vouchers. Slept at a nice hotel at ORD. Because of the low price for they tried to put us on a non direct fight for Washington and then to SFO. We finally got scheduled for a flight at 8:30. the airplane was okay. It was an old 757-200 with no entertainment systems or stuff. When we arrived at SFO it was midday and we still had time to explore the city.,2us-airways,16/01/14,"January 15 2014. Flew from Palm Springs to Portland with connection in Phoenix. Connection was ""legal"" with 28 minutes from first flight touchdown to door closure on connecting flight. Of course the flight in was in a separate terminal so the time to get from one gate to the other was a 30 minute ordeal. Needless to say of the 4 passengers that were to connect none made it. When I arrived at the connecting gate after running across the entire Phoenix airport I was greeted by a very non caring gate crew. They immediately asked me if I was connecting from Palm Springs and when I said yes the gate rep just said that the flight was closed and I have to take another flight. I asked if they knew we were coming in from Palm Springs and they knew the plane had landed and they knew we were all coming from about a mile away then why on earth would they not hold the door an extra ten minutes. This is their scheduling screw-up not mine. The lack of apology and talking to us as if the whole thing was somehow our fault just puts a bad taste in my mouth.",2united-airlines,16/05/14,San Diego to Moline via Chicago O'Hare. When we landed in Chicago I received a text message from United Airlines that our connecting flight was canceled. They rescheduled us for 14 hours later! We live 2 1/2 hours away so we rented a car and drove. Our reimbursement was 1/4 the cost didn't even cover the car rental. No other mode of transportation was offered neither was a compensation for food or hotel if we had chose to stay and wait the 14 hours. This apparently happens very often. No excuse but they don't have a problem stealing your money and not giving anything in return. This company should not be allowed to run their business this way. I will never book a flight with United Airlines again.,1us-airways,13/01/14,We sat on the tarmac for an hour got into the air only to be told there was a mechanical error. Flew in circles around the airport for 4.5 hours (longer than my actual flight) to burn off fuel were treated rudely by staff and no beverages were offered the entire time. Our rescheduled flight was for 7.30 am the next morning and when we arrived it said it was on time for 8.45am. When I asked they said that even though it was late it wasn't really their fault so even though it was over an hour late it was still considered on time. They then double booked my grandfathers seat and tried to move him out of first class. On our way back we sat in line for 3.5 hours to check in because the system had crashed and the flight was delayed 2 hours just so that they could check everyone in which meant I almost missed my connecting flight. I am currently waiting on my bags the next day. I am never flying US airways again.,us-airways,13/01/14,LHR to Philadelphia. Good catering. Very full flight. Pleasant cabin crew. Touchscreen was a bit unresponsive at times but all in all not bad for 8 hour economy flight. Unfortunately ended up with a middle seat.,8united-airlines,16/05/14,This was the worst travel experience I have had. I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC. Halfway through my first flight we were dropped down in Denver due to a closing at the ORD airport. They de-boarded re-boarded de-boarded re-boarded then de-boarded again. We were there for an excess of 4 hours standing in excessive lines awaiting information about connecting flights and possible re-bookings. It seemed like all the United agents were hiding! I was finally cleared to take off for Chicago and put on standby for 2 later flights to ROC. We were stalled on the runway at ORD and arrived at the gate very late. When I went to find my next flight it had been moved. No notification was sent to me but the agent ensured that it was boarding at another gate. I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent. When I finally got to the front of the line I was told it was due to weather and I would not be accommodated. I told the agent that it wasn't weather that it was an excessively delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flights. He then handed me a bag of toiletries and suggested I find a hotel on my own and ushered me aside. By the time I walked away from the line it was 12:00 am and every hotel I called was booked. I am now sitting awaiting my flight to ROC and it too has been moved from gate to gate without proper notification. I was told to watch the monitors until my flight takes off. I also just found out that my flight will be delayed again. I now understand why United is suffering; their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I don't recommend ever flying with this company. Rates are reasonable but it is most certainly not worth the hassle.,1united-airlines,16/05/14,Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together! I'm scoring high for what we received but unsure I'd travel with them again as could so easily have turned out badly & also couldn't recommend to friends in case they have the nerves I had in advance and at the airport caused by UA procedure FOR online checkin/not allocating seats/together.,8us-airways,10/01/14,We flew from Philadelphia to Dominican Republic round trip. Overall it was a good experience though the airline needs to do a lot to improve their inflight service.,6us-airways,08/01/14,I flew from Denver to Charlotte to get a connecting flight to Jacksonville NC. The Denver flight was delayed 1.5 hrs due to maintenance therefore I missed my connecting flight they rebooked me for another flight but I had to stay the night in Charlotte but gave me a hotel voucher for a booked hotel. The flight from Charlotte to Jacksonville was also delayed due to maintenance. Moral of the story US Airways has horrible planes that always need maintenance. Don't fly with them unless you want to be late or miss every connecting flight.,united-airlines,16/05/14,Reno-Denver-Chicago-Louisville. All flights on time. Late check-in at Reno (my fault) and the ground staff helped to rush me through and make the flight all with a positive attitude and was greeted upon boarding the plane. Each flight was about 85% full so not packed in. Leg room was just fine on the A320 B757 and EMB175. All attendants pleasant with just enough drink runs on each flight. All beverages were free including spirits. This was in economy! Arrived on time in Louisville more than happy with my day flying across country on three different flights. Plus my luggage made it. Maybe I am just lucky but United always seems to work out great for me. Used my air miles so this round trip only cost me $10.,9us-airways,03/01/14,I recently flew U.S. Airways from Denver to Boston MA. Although I had to change my flight from one day to the next and pay an extra fee for the change the flight was very comfortable. After I arrived in Boston I knew that my bags were MIA. I had recently flown from San Francisco to Denver and they sent my bags to Washington D.C. even though I never made that flight but since I was scheduled to be in Boston I had to travel knowing I didn't have my bags. I was very pleased with Susan at customer service in Boston. As I arrived she promptly assisted me in locating my bags. She was also extremely pleasant to me as a customer. Needless to say because of her my bags were returned and I will definitely be flying U.S. again!,10us-airways,03/01/14,This has to be the worst airline I have flown on and I do travel a lot. Our recent supposedly first class flight from PVR to YVR started late in PVR due to technical difficulties. A two hour 10 minute flight in first ranks a cardboard cup of coffee and a bag of potato chips! The second leg was delayed due to technical problems then when ready to leave a drunken passenger had to be removed on the insistence of a passenger (the attendant said he knew he was drunk but not how much) and then the plane developed a mechanical problem necessitating a plane change. 4 hours late and what did first class passengers get for their now 7 plus hour trip-yes you guessed it a bag of chips and a drink. They should be banned from Star Alliance Membership until a new experienced in customer service CEO is hired. Clearly this is the fault of the Executive not the cabin crew. By the way no inflight entertainment and the seat in front of me was broken.,2united-airlines,16/05/14,United airline is a terrible airline for overseas travels. I flew Chicago to Frankfort. Crew were rude and unhelpful. Somebody was seating in my seat and crew didn't support me when I asked her to go back to her seat. I reserved a seat at the time of booking and they sold me the same seat for extra $100! In a 12 hr flight there is no free alcoholic beverage no socks toothbrush or toothpaste. I strongly recommend never fly with united especially for overseas.,1us-airways,02/01/14,I flew in November 2013. Rarely have I experienced such stressed out miserable flight attendants. Their unhappiness changed the tenor of the entire trip. There were no unusual conditions with the trip. We had a packed flight but we weren't running late and passengers weren't making any special demands or causing problems. The attendants' facial expressions body language and polite curtness spoke of barely held in tension. In addition to that passengers were herded onto the plane managed like we were an inconvenience (again politely but still the feeling was there) and the plane itself was dirty. While US Airways is offering some good flight deals I don't feel inclined to fly an airline where the staff are clearly not happy with their jobs. Additionally US Airways needs to beef up their efforts to provide a great experience for their customers.,5us-airways,02/01/14,Multiple frustration with seating arrangements we (fiancÃ© and I) purchased our ticket a month in advance and were later told that we would be together. Found or seating arrangement a week before the flight and seated separately. No customer service would help. When boarding I was holding my tablet in hand my back pack and wheeled baggage. They got on my case about my tablet that I was only allowed a carry on and personal bag. Told I would need to put my tablet in the bag. Or check in one of my bags. They were dead serious that they wanted me to step aside and put my tablet in my carry on or else have to check-in my bag. Seats were cramped and I'm a slightly small framed individual.,2united-airlines,13/05/14,IAD-SFO and SFO-IAD Flew United non-stop in economy. Absolutely no complaints. The planes were clean on time and the flight attendants were very good - always working. We brought our own food on board so cannot comment on the food sold. On the SFO-IAD flight there was quite a bit of turbulence but the pilot handled it very well. All of the United employees we encountered in the air and on the ground were friendly helpful and seemed to be happy in their jobs.,9united-airlines,12/05/14,I wish I would have read the reviews for United before letting the travel agency book me on one of their flights. Twice we took off from Denver and both times we were re-routed back. The only information we got was a two second message from the pilot that we were going back. We were completely on our own to find out what we were supposed to do. None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question. After standing in the customer service line to re-book I was told no flights for two days. The customer service lady did seem to care and spent half an hour looking for alternatives. I heard all sorts of people complaining about this airline and our shuttle driver said she hears about them all the time.,1us-airways,02/01/14,Traveled from Long Beach to Phoenix and then onward to JFK Airport on red-eye flight. This flight left much to be desired as everything from the hard to soft product are abysmal. Domestic first seats are unbearably uncomfortable to sleep in with the angle recline only going down about 3-5 inches. As for the on board amenities free alcohol and few select chips just doesn't cut it though they do offer meals on non red-eye flights from what I've been told. It gets even better as the sad excuse of a blanket they provided for sleep was a thin fabric that can easily be mistaken for as a table cloth. Club access in Phoenix was granted with *G and much like the flight it left a lot to be desired as well - stale crackers unappealing soup and choices of free and paid drinks. Positive to flight was that staff service is fair and ground handling was par. As a star alliance traveler I really wished there was a better alternative to traveling domestic US.,6us-airways,31/12/13,I flew from Italy to Pittsburgh (via Philadelphia) on Nov 14 2013 with return on Dec 28 2013 via Philadelphia and Frankfurt. On my return flight to Frankfurt (A330 plane with IFE at seat) I felt very dizzy and was about to pass out halfway into the flight. The flight attendants in Economy promptly assisted me and checked on me every 10 minutes to see how I was feeling. Their attentiveness and concern were much appreciated especially as I was traveling alone. What's more the US Airways staff in every airport (Venice Philadelphia Pittsburgh and Frankfurt) were courteous and professional. I have absolutely no complaints with this airline and will fly with them again.,10united-airlines,12/05/14,Recently flew several long international flights with United from Chicago to Tokyo and back. For a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment no seatback TV and they not charge money for drinks. I would argue that United is well below the average. The flight attendants do the bare minimum and nothing more. I will not fly on United again.,3united-airlines,12/05/14,EWR-ZRH. Traveled with baby staff very inattentive and almost ignored our requests even as simple as asking for some water (to make baby food). When water was brought this was done with no empathy and not asking if there was something else they could do. Any question was first met by unfriendly looks. United's ground service at EWR was a catastrophe. There are electronic check-in counters about 20 with max. 3 staff to put the luggage onto the conveyor belt or to help if something can't be done through the user's interface the computer tells you to 'wait for staff to help you' we waited for more than 20 minutes.,1us-airways,31/12/13,We flew from Denver - Phoenix - Puerto Vallarta on 12/25/13. Denver to Phoenix was ok. In Phoenix the female gate attendant was very rude stating we must check our carry on bags. On board several open spaces in overheads. Puerto Vallarta-Phoenix flight was ok. Phoenix-Denver flight was the same rude female supervisor again had to check carryon bag. FA's are rude and act like they are along just for the ride. This is the first and last experience with this airline.,1us-airways,31/12/13,Flew on 12/24/13 from SYR to PHL to GSP - worst experience due to USAir's inability to publish a flight schedule with connections that could be met and PHL HUB employees not having enough knowledge of alternative airports and airlines. Additionally all personnel I spoke with at PHL or on the phone looking for assistance were very very rude.,united-airlines,12/05/14,We flew to Puerto Vallarta and back with a connection in Houston. Believe it or not flying United we actually had a fairly decent experience. Yes the seats in coach are tight and uncomfortable. But at least 2 of the 4 flights left on time. Both flights to PV were on time and landed a bit ahead of schedule. We weren't so lucky on our return flights. The flight out of PV was delayed about a half hour because our plane arrived late. The flight out of Houston was delayed about 90 minutes but wasn't United's fault. There were many storms in Texas that night especially in Austin where our plane was coming from. So again the delay was not the fault of United. When we finally did leave we hit a lot of turbulence but that was expected due to the weather. All in all United did OK. Other then a few of their complimentary drinks that's all we had on the plane. We refuse to pay for airline food. Not once on any flight did either my wife or myself use the bathroom. So to some it up even though I hate to fly this experience wasn't that bad.,6united-airlines,12/05/14,It seems to have become the norm for United Express to not announce any delays until everyone is checked in. Then the announcements come every half hour increasing the wait time. Our flight from Halifax to Newark was to depart at 1.10 pm and eventually left after 5pm. Our return flight was to leave at 8.38 pm and left after midnight. Never ever again.,1us-airways,29/12/13,I flew from Guadalajara to Phoenix then to San Jose (GDL-PHX-SJC). In Guadalajara boarding was on-time and take off also on-time. We arrived to PHX at the scheduled time but we only had 1 hour to catch the next flight to SJC we lost it because immigration queues were too congested. The staff of US Airways was perfect they re-booked the tickets and we had to wait 4 more hours in the airport. When we were finally onboard the next plane (both Airbus A320) we had to wait 40 more minutes. Arrive at SJC 1 hour delayed.,5us-airways,23/12/13,PHL-SJU-PHL. Although I generally have a negative image of this airline I must give credit where credit is due. Both flights were on newer A330's with very polite and attentive FA's and both flights departed and landed on time despite snowy conditions in Philadelphia . The one complaint I have is that the IFE was not turned as this is only provided on transatlantic flights - how much exactly does it cost US Airways to turn on a system they already have installed in the aircraft?,7united-airlines,11/05/14,My husband and I recently returned from a trip using United Airlines. We arrived at our international destination 12 hours later than the original arrival time. Since that was mainly due to weather I can't blame United. On the way home though we had a terrible experience. Our final flight from Houston to Fayetteville was supposed to board at 6.45pm but they kept delaying it around every half hour until finally at midnight they canceled the flight entirely. There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport. We had to book a flight to Tulsa where our family had to drive a long way to pick us up. This plane was also delayed for an hour for no apparent reason. Upon reaching Tulsa we discovered our luggage had been separated and my bag was sent to our original destination while my husband's stayed back in Houston airport. We had to drive to Fayetteville airport to pick up my bag. The next day we had to drive back to Fayetteville to pick up my husband's bag. Definitely the last time we will ever fly with United.,1us-airways,23/12/13,Flew Fresno - Phoenix - Orlando 3 day trip. Last month flew Fresno - Phoenix - Charlotte. Last trip was a nightmare because of delays - mechanical resulting in missed flights and a flight crew on the last leg that seemed to not be too concerned with the delay given it was late at night. Anyway booked again. This time first class. Good experience. First leg out operated by Sky West. Flight attendants - two of them talking loudly all the time. Were attentive to passenger needs. Hopefully will be more sensitive given that some of us had been up since 4 am to get ready for the flight. Rest of the trip was great. Bottom line flight crew is key to a positive experience. Will fly US Air again.,8us-airways,21/12/13,DFW to LGA via CLT. All flights went smoothly. I was a little nervous since we left Dallas 30 minutes late and had only 20 minutes for the connecting flight to LGA. However flight to LGA boarded passengers from the same terminal that we arrived from which was very convenient (arrival and departure gate was right next to each other) My luggage also made it despite short connection time in Charlotte. I kept tracking my bag by using their iPhone application as well as the flight status while in the air. Crew members were extremely polite and offered more than one round of soft drinks and coffee. My only criticism would be their boarding policy. I was group 2 on the first flight but group 5 on the final flight even though I was sitting in the front section of the cabin. I received Star Alliance partner miles within 5 days into my account.,8united-airlines,11/05/14,Flew to Chicago on Friday flight was delayed 6 hours. When it came time to return home I received an email that my flight was cancelled. I talked to a United rep she told me an identical flight was leaving at the same time as my cancelled flight so she would book me on that one. Turns out she misinformed me there was no such flight. I got to the airport found out she had booked me for a flight the following day so I had to rebook yet again. On my return flight the plane was delayed 2 hours. We all get on the plane and after taxi-ing for 45 minutes we received an announcement that we were going back to the gate. I had to spend the night in the airport. I will never fly United again.,1united-airlines,11/05/14,My husband booked our flight out of Gulfport MS to Las Vegas. The price was good but we were not allowed enough time between connecting flights. My husband is in a wheelchair and I appreciate the skycaps who managed to get us to the connecting flights although it almost killed me at 65 to have to get through the airport with our luggage. The biggest mishap was that when we arrived in Los Angeles from Las Vegas we were told there was no room for our carry on luggage so it was checked. My husband's bag went to Hawaii. After many days of talking to people on the phone who obviously have a problem understanding English we finally got his bag delivered. Flying United was very stressful for me and I would be very hesitant to fly United again. I think they need to do a better job of informing their customers of what to expect.,5us-airways,17/12/13,I feel that there is simply no excuse travel on a transcontinental flight and be served no meals except the horrible choice that you are given and have to buy. Airlines should be required to serve at least one meal without charge when you are flying all of the way across the USA! On the way back on the last leg of my journey back home to Newport News Virginia we were not even served water!,united-airlines,11/05/14,"Plane was supposed to take off at 1pm delayed to 3pm then finally to 7pm with no guarantee of no further delay. Now I am stuck in LAX waiting. All I got for the trouble caused by United Airline is a sorry from the representative and a $7 meal voucher - very good customer care indeed. Request to adjust seat told the plane is 100% full. Okay so I request to adjust seat in advance for my return flight now this is where it gets interesting: I was told by the desk representative that their ""system"" will not let her do so and was advised to use United Airline website to adjust seat myself the only problem is their website does not have the seat change option either. Overall I would not recommend anyone to take United Airline for their poor system setup and bad customer care.",1us-airways,17/12/13,I've been flying US Airways for nearly 3 months. Four flights per week for a total of 48. Nearly half of them have been delayed due to some sort of mechanical issue. These issues always take much longer than the expected amount of time to the point that I have missed 10 connections in that period. Two weeks ago I flew IAH to CLT to see my flight to SAV was delayed by 30 minutes then 1 hour then cancelled without explanation. Customer service offered a flight at 9 pm 12 hours later. In fact I'm currently on board a flight to CLT that cannot depart because the plane has had ice for an hour and a half. Rather than moving to have the plane de-iced at the north end of the airport they attempted to fix it with a heating truck then a second one. The crew has been unsympathetic throughout and I'm frankly tired of it. Unfortunately I'm not in charge of booking my business flights. But for those that have the option I would suggest avoiding US Airways if you intend to ever arrive on time.,1united-airlines,10/05/14,EWR-IND think United is canceling more flights than they are operating. If not canceled flights are most of the time significantly delayed. Ground staff are unfriendly and not willing to help. This is not an experience just on this flight it seems to be always like that. Comfort and service in the aircraft is lousy. Will try not to go with United in the future.,1united-airlines,10/05/14,Traveled CLE-SFO-NRT-MNL March 15th returned May 7th. Business class. Booked this reluctantly experience a year earlier was not so great on the SFO-NRT leg. In cabin service and food was terrible. This year was a world different. All flights on time or early food was good inflight service was very good the inflight entertainment worked great check in was very friendly and attentive. The final leg is serviced by ANA. Last year the difference between UA and ANA was dramatic. This year practically seamless. The only change this year was that we were on the upper deck this time. We were amazed at the transformation in a year's time. Younger attentive flight attendants friendly service and all worked as planned. Great transformation!,7us-airways,17/12/13,When I checked in I checked with the agent to make sure that the plane was not delayed and that I would not be running in to weather issues. She assured me that it would not be a problem because of my flight time. So I made no arrangements to rebook anything. That quickly turned out to be a lie. We started with a delayed flight out of DFW 1.5 hours delayed while we waited on the plane to be de-iced. We finally arrive with passengers that had connections to Richmond and Denver. Due to the delay our planed landed 5-10 minutes too late to make the connection. Both planes were still at the gates. But instead of holding the planes by 5-10 minutes which by the way would not have caused any disruption of service because all of the planes that had connections were the last flights of the day. Instead a conscious decision was made to deliberately force all of the passengers to miss their planes and have to incur hotel food and transportation expenses. I was one of the first passengers to be turned away. The gate agent was still at the gate the plane was still at the gate but she said they had shut the door and I was stuck for the night. I then got in line and was stuck on the next flight and sent on my way. The next day I get to the gate. It is a full flight and everyone in group 4 and 5 are told they can only have 1 bag or personal item. I checked with the agent and made sure that it was okay for me to have my laptop bag and my shopping bag. Then at the gate I was told that I could not take my laptop bag. Instead I had to take both of my laptops out check my laptop bag and then crush my designed hand bag and pastries by cramming them under the seat with my unprotected laptops. It seemed like every step of the way every agent of USAir intentionally tried to make this the worst possible trip possible.,us-airways,17/12/13,I purchased two round trip tickets on USAirways for travel from DC to Orlando FL for the Thanksgiving holiday. We were unable to use the ticket for flight from DC to Orlando and U SAirways canceled our return tickets from Orlando to DC. I found this out when I tried to check in online for the return flight. We had to rent a car and drive from Orlando to DC because our tickets had been canceled.,united-airlines,08/05/14,Do not pay the extra cost for the comfort seats. That is the biggest scam that this airline has going. I have paid for comfort seats on KLM and WestJet and they were so worth it. This airline - expensive and the only thing you get is slightly more leg room. The same uncomfortable seat in all other ways. This airline has to have the worst service of all airlines in the G20 (sorry have not flown others). Terrible seats extra cost for luggage what food is available is awful and expensive and now you have to pay for inflight entertainment. On a recent flight to Hawaii at least they had the courtesy of telling us not to bother because the inflight entertainment did not work over the ocean anyway. I love to read but 6 hours straight is quite a reading marathon. I will pay extra costs for a flight rather than fly United.,1united-airlines,08/05/14,As a seasoned traveler I am constantly reminded what a disgrace United Airlines is to the Star Alliance. I've just completed a Star Alliance Round The World Business First trip on Thai Lufthansa Air Canada Air New Zealand and unfortunately one sector on United. Despite being Gold Elite status and paying $US15000 each for the fare United refused me entry to their lounge in MCO at 0615h - when it was almost totally empty. They seated my wife and I in 3B and 5F for the six hour flight to SFO despite being booked on the one ticket and pre- allocated 1A and 1B four months earlier! Are the traveling American public so accepting of sub-standard?,1us-airways,16/12/13,Booked my flight AND free seat selection (8E) on 6/9 for my flight to PHL on the 15/11/13. At check in they gave me seat 24 which was the worst though 8E had been confirmed by US Air. They said that they have no obligation to provide the confirmed seat of my choice! Strongly complained to supervisor via phone and asked for aisle seat for my return flight on the 8/12/2013. He said plane was almost full and the best he could do was give me an aisle seat row again 24. Plane was 1/3 full practically empty and at PHL airport I was given row 12. Inflight service both ways far below average no comments on food. This airline in no way can compare with European airlines and this was my fourth disappointing experience with this company.,1us-airways,09/12/13,I flew from Honolulu to PHX and PHX back to Honolulu. I was very disappointed with this airline my first impression was horrible. Going to PHX from HNL the flight attendants on US airways were very rude and unprofessional. The aircraft that services HNL is always the 757. It was very squashed no wifi 3 by 3 seating configuration on the left and right side thus no room to move around. The interior of the plane was falling apart tray tables did not at all stay in the lock position. Lighting everything seemed out dated. Meal service was horrible you have to pay for meals where as on Hawaiian Airlines all meals are complimentary. Coming back from PHX to HNL flight attendant and customer service was very outstandingly rude. We were delayed 1 hour because we had to wait on a US air flight attendant who was late. This is unacceptable.,united-airlines,07/05/14,26 April 2014 Verona-Monaco. LH 434 26 April 2014 Monaco-Chicago. UA 8838 26 April 2014 Chicago-Madison. Superb Lufthansa service than you land in the USA and there is a long line at Passport control and no way to have an express service. I missed my connecting flight and what a surprise it was my fault and I had to pay for the hotel transport food etc.,4united-airlines,06/05/14,Nothing but delays right from the start. We flew Vancouver to Chicago then to Ireland. Everyone had to check in themselves and weren't given seat numbers until boarding so no sitting next to your family. Staff weren't friendly. Flight was an hour late departing. No organization at all at the airport. Would not use them again.,2us-airways,09/12/13,My son had a very expensive round-trip ticket for Thanksgiving break: Spokane to Los Angeles with transfers in Phoenix. We confirmed the flights online. We tried to check in at the airport on Dec 1 for the return flight at least 30 min early (6am). My son had only one carry-on and a backpack. Theoretically he could use the automatic kiosk to get his boarding pass and go directly through security. They had already sold his ticket. The woman behind the counter wasted our time. It took 10 more minutes to call the supervisor. They were rude and told us we should have been there 45 min early. They gave my son a standby ticket for flights when the Phoenix transfer was at 9pm with no chance of getting aboard. That would mean he would be sitting at the airport from 6am to 9pm! I had to pay a change of flight fee $225 plus $250 for the next day.,united-airlines,05/05/14,My father and I had a reservation to fly from Boston to Sacramento. We had a connecting flight in Denver. Our flight leaving Boston was delayed 50 minutes our flight arrived in Denver at the exact time our connecting flight from Denver was leaving. United Airlines didn't hold the next plane just a few minutes and so 13 people on our plane missed the connecting flight. The next flight for Sacramento left the next morning so we went to customer service to have them reserve a hotel for us but they claimed that the error was not made by their airline and wouldn't pay for our hotel. Now we have to sit in an airport terminal all night. United Airlines is not a good airline and I won't be flying with them anymore.,1united-airlines,04/05/14,Nightmare with United last week. I had a 1st class ticket Miami-Chicago on UA and Chicago-Zurich-Brussels on Swiss 3 flights on one ticket. Connecting time in Chicago 3 hours and 25 minutes. Checked-in in Miami for my UA flight and Y flight was delayed several times. Finally the plane landed. Ready for boarding and then technical failure was announced. Staff did not know if and when the plane would leave. I explained my situation and asked to be rebooked on another airline any airline in order to leave Miami since I was supposed to have a knee surgery upon my return in Brussels. UA staff refused and were not polite at all. Finally at 8pm announcement that our flight was cancelled. I had spent nearly 7 hours at that airport. I was granted a room at the Holiday Inn airport which was fine and then food vouchers at the same hotel. In total 21 USD for lunch/dinner/breakfast. One thing is for sure never again United. I was rebooked on the day after Miami/Newark/Brussels on the day after first class domestic business class long-haul. Ok but far from the Swiss service standards.,1us-airways,04/12/13,My two young kids and I flew US Airways over the thanksgiving holiday. All four of our flights were on time and the connections were all within the same terminal which was a plus. The staff were friendly on every flight as well. On our last flight the airplane didn't have enough seats due to a smaller airplane than expected so all the passengers in the last ten rows had to be put on different flights. It was obviously an inconvenience but they did a phenomenal job handling it. They immediately put us on another flight that was leaving at the exact same time got an airport cart to take us to our new terminal gave us each $200 vouchers and delivered our luggage to our home. They were so kind and apologetic what more can anyone ask for!,9us-airways,03/12/13,"On Columbus Day Weekend from MYR to LGA through CLT the first flight was scheduled to leave at 2.23 then from CLT to LGA at 4.30. When I got to the airport at Myrtle the lady at the counter told me my flight was not leaving until 4.50 because of a ""mechanical error."" I received no notification or email. She put me on a 10 pm flight to LGA without my consent. This is absolutely unacceptable for an airline. She refused to tell me that there were earlier flights available so I looked myself and found a flight on Delta which left 3 hours earlier. The staff at US Airways are so unsympathetic and simply do not care about the customers. I recommend flying any other airline unless US airways is your only option. The flight attendants refused to apologize for this too. Never again on this airline.",us-airways,03/12/13,Our flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix was canceled due to fog and our second leg was rescheduled for 12 hours later without ever getting in touch with me to have my permission for this move. I drove to Phoenix to catch my second flight and got there on time but was not able to get on that flight because they already gave away my tickets. Mind you economy class over $2.5k for 2 tickets and then you get pushed around whichever way! I wonder whether you just turned around and ripped someone off to sell my tickets and then reschedule me for an overnight trip! Not to mention that the rest of the service was not that hot either. The person on the phone was not so polite or helpful in addition. Really a huge disappointment US Airways!,united-airlines,04/05/14,Outward journey on 30/3/2014 on flight UA 941 and inbound journey on 25/4/2014 on flight UA 17. We had a double cancellation of flights to and from LHR-EWR. Flight to LHR was cancelled but the reason remained unclear and the flight from EWR was cancelled after we were told there was a technical problem with the aircraft. Luckily they gave us hotel accommodation and taxi fares along with also breakfast and dinner vouchers. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. It caused lots of stress.,2us-airways,29/11/13,I started flying with US Airways a few years ago when they offered competitive business class (envoy) fares from Ireland and received a Dividend Miles Gold Card from them two years ago. On 9th November 2013 I flew first class on an internal flight from Tampa to Charlotte. I had to pay $50 to spend one hour in the US Airways Club in Tampa airport a lounge that does not offer a shower facility. The fact that I was flying first class and holding a US Airways Dividend Miles gold card was irrelevant to the staff at the reception desk there. I will never fly with US Airways again.,3us-airways,29/11/13,We flew with one-stop from Boston to Phoenix and then Phoenix to Maui Hawaii. Each leg of the trip was about 6 hours so we splurged for 1st Class assuming it would be more comfortable and have full amenities one would expect at $1300 per seat (one way). Pulled out my headphones but found nowhere on the seat to plug into? Was told there were no music TV movies or other entertainment options. Wi-Fi was offered at a price but it still would not allow for any streaming services so what's the point? Staff were polite and matter of fact. Meal was mediocre even for airline food. No complaint with the beverage service they realize it's the best way to medicate you. We eventually had 3 each and fell asleep. We had about 40 minutes between flights and they didn't announce the gates for connecting flights at the end of the flight as many airlines do for their passenger's convenience. On the ground in Phoenix we learned that the gate for our second flight to Maui was clear on the other side of the airport so we hurried with our carry-ons to the far end some 30 gates away. As soon as we got there they announced a gate change that flight which required us to rush right back across the entire airport again to the gate area where we had started at!! Everyone already at the gate bolted for the far end of the airport along with us. Insane. Even Jet Blue economy is a better flight experience. We will never use this airline again.,3united-airlines,03/05/14,FRA-SFO on 747-400 this might have been a 9 or 10 star review except for the very late (over 30 minutes) delivery of bags at SFO with priority bags not apparently given any priority - service onboard was impeccable - staff were attentive and professional and did everything they could to make the long flight as comfortable as possible - UA really does need to start handing out pyjamas in F and could also make the bed softer as well as making the blankets thicker and wider if they really want passengers to get some good sleep. Food was OK nothing special - the mushroom soup in a very small cup was the best course while the beef was tough.,6united-airlines,03/05/14,I really don't know how to express my dissatisfaction with United. I buy business class and get dumped into economy. No explanation nothing. Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience. United advertising is good unfortunately they only talk the talk. United has yet to learn how to walk the talk. United just frustrates me to no end.,1us-airways,27/11/13,"Nov 21 MOB-CLT-ORD. CR7 from Mobile to Charlotte. Flight boarded on time and left 15 minutes early. Flight attendant was nice and let everyone sleep as it was a 6am flight. Landed on time and long walk from Concourse E to B for connecting flight. A321 to ORD - boarded and flight attendant at the door had her back to the door so wasn't greeting anyone. Then the next FA as you walked into the coach cabin was on here cell phone and either ignored the passengers coming in or waved them a ""hello"". Totally unprofessional and rude. Flight was packed but left on time. Smooth flight and comfortable seats - limited service from FA's. Really will be interesting to see what happens with the merger with AA.",6us-airways,27/11/13,I experienced delays inbound and outbound. In cabin satisfaction is dependent on the crew. Flight back to SFO captain reported 2 tyres needed to be changed. Should be done in 15 mins comes back with 20 min extensions for total delay of 60-90 mins. No inflight beverage service. Never experienced this on other flights. Good for the crew they got to sit out. Delayed arrival because of mechanical issue. Flown many times. I would describe myself as a non complainer on flights so far as I have accepted the decline in service in general.,3united-airlines,01/05/14,Horrible service rude flight attendants check in process rude. The woman told us it was not her job to do the check-in for us when we had questions and the machine would not print or accept my credit card. We were left to our own devices and were just rudely told to hurry up as we were not the only customers there. Since we booked with Lufthansa and paid regular prices and not with a cheap aircraft carrier this behaviour was outrageous! After we finally got our prints (just flight confirmations not boarding cards) we were told we would get the boarding passes at the gate. After asking a couple of times we got our boarding passes just to be told during boarding our daughter could not be seated with us because we were sitting in an emergency exit and she had to sit 7 rows behind us. The cabin attendants were not very helpful and finally we got a nice couple to swap places with us.,2united-airlines,01/05/14,April 27 2014 OKC to YYZ my connecting flight was in EWR. When I arrived at Newark I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. The reason for cancellation - bad weather in Toronto. I asked the staff member to find me a different flight the best he could come up with was a flight for the next day! I explained that this was unacceptable. I then asked if I did accept the flight for the next day would I be given a hotel room for the night his response was no because if the flight is cancelled due to weather then the airline is not at fault and does not have to provide a room. To put the cherry on top he would not look for other flights except for the one for the next day. His suggestion was that I researched possible routes home and come speak to him later when I found another flight that was more acceptable to me. I was at a loss. I managed to acquire a flight home that same afternoon to Toronto on Air Canada. What I want to know is how is the weather in Toronto can be a problem for United airlines but not a problem for every other airline in North America. I fly several times a year I will never fly with United Airlines again.,1us-airways,27/11/13,Manchester UK to Fort Lauderdale via Philadelphia. Trans Atlantic in Envoy A332. Great seats and meal was excellent. The service is not to BA or Virgin standards but was never the less very good. Lounge stop over at Philadelphia was very good and economy trip to FLL on an airbus A321 nice flight with good seats. Return FLL to PHL on an Embraer 195 first time on this plane and very good experience 2 plus 2 seating in economy. Club Lounge at PHL was an excellent oasis although not a patch on BA or Virgin lounges. A332 in Envoy for trip back to UK was great again although staff on this flight not as good and the food served was lukewarm and attention to detail was lacking bread offered after you had eaten the main course! Breakfast omelette and sausage was good. Overall a great Enoy experience once again I do hope that Envoy brand is retained when the AA/ US merger is complete otherwise I will miss the US Airways experience as I can honestly say I have never had a bad flight with them and I have had quite a few.,9us-airways,27/11/13,LGA-CLT-SDF-CLT-LGA with the CLT-SDF segments operated by express carriers. I was worried about the short transit times and the vast CLT RJ complex but it more or less worked out. Departure from SDF-CLT was on a day with miserable weather but US made it out and I made the connection with maybe 1-2 minutes to spare. The LGA terminal is really a pleasure to use with short lines and a nice amount of space near the gates. Staff service was good throughout. Only problem is the lack of BOB even on the mainline flights - just offering nuts and chips is not enough during lunch time and with short connections there's not really any other choice!,6united-airlines,01/05/14,"I flew from BTV-EWR-DFW a few months ago and it was by far the worst experience. Outbound flight to EWR was delayed 1 hour 15 minutes. The connection in EWR was missed by about 3 minutes. The customer service agent was useless and also put the blame on myself for missing the connection. I waited about 5.5 hours in what has to have been the dingiest terminal in the US (Newark's C2 concourse) for the next flight to DFW which of course was delayed. Once boarded we sat at the gate for an additional 40 minutes without any communication from the crew. The pilot then informed us that ""it appears the people refuelling this thing put more in the right wing than they did in the left"". We waited yet another 20 minutes for him to come back and say ""to add insult to injury it appears that the APU is broken and it wouldn't be a good idea to fly without it."" An hour has passed since we boarded and we finally pushed back. The inflight service was sub-par and only one beverage service was offered during the 3.5 hour flight. Overall an appalling experience on an airline that used to be enjoyable. Also if you're not flying international or a hub to hub expect a regional jet or prop plane.",1us-airways,25/11/13,Flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia with a connection to Florida. Flights were on time the planes (A330 and A321) were clean modern and the staff on board and on ground were welcoming. The food on board was actually really good! The on-board entertainment was very good other than the touch screen wasn't very responsive but no big deal! Having read reviews I was quite apprehensive about travelling with US Airways and honestly I couldn't fault them. Pleasant flight lots of stewardesses offering drinks food etc. Would gladly use them again.,10us-airways,25/11/13,I was in 1C on a US Airways A321. The flight was a little over 5 hours which was too long to be sitting in this seat. The seat was worn out and reclined about as much as coach. And seat 1d was completely broken. The meal was average and the service was poor. I would never pay for these seats and would only sit in them if I got a preferred upgrade.,6united-airlines,01/05/14,We flew out to San Francisco on Delta on April 27 2014 - a great flight even though we had a longer trip because of storms. The flight waited on us constantly during the long flight. On May 1 2014 we flew home on United 1278. The two stewards and one stewardess were terrible! Went up and down twice during our flight back to Atlanta. I was in a window seat and hey never spoke to me! The pilot did a good job - but did not speak loud enough.,4us-airways,18/11/13,Having logged hundreds of thousands of miles world-wide I would rank my recent experience with U.S. Airways be in the top two of my worst travel experiences. Oakland - Phoenix - New York - Phoenix - Oakland. Eastbound Oakland and westbound New York flights were both late departing (the latter by more than one hour). Nearly missed my eastbound Phoenix connection and actually did miss my westbound connecting Phoenix flight due to late departure from NYC. My Westbound flight took nearly 11 hours from NYC to Oakland. I could have flown to Europe in that amount of time (less actually). Promised meal eastbound was not provided after all. Dinner consisted of a bag of pretzels. Bad news overall.,1united-airlines,01/05/14,MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it. In one generation United has gone from industry standard to mediocre to absolute lowest common denominator.,2us-airways,18/11/13,MIA-PHLin business class: the seats were nice and spacious however didn't seem particularly clean. The service was OK but nothing special almost surly. PHL-VCE in business class: we had to wait to be airborne before the inflight entertainment was switched the headphones and the TV screens installed in the individual cradles. Once that was done the selection was rather limited. The service was OK the attendants did what they had to do but there was no enthusiasm in what they were doing overall above all considering that the plane was half empty in both classes. The food was actually tasty and well presented. The seats a bit temperamental to begin with and then not too comfortable: they didn't flat out completely so not too conducive to sleeping. The lounge in PHL was nice but the food selection there was extremely limited surely if compared to other StarAlliance lounges around the world.,7us-airways,18/11/13,I flew from Newport News Virginia to L.A. with a connecting flight in Charlotte. The plane left Newport News about half an hour late and so it looked like I would miss my connecting flight. But I ran all the way from gate E to B9. I arrived at the gate to see that the plane was still taxied and attached to that little bridge walkway to board the plane. It looked like I made it but when I tried to give my boarding pass to the lady she very coldly told me I was too late. I tried to plead my case in a calm and rational way but was told that the next flight was in an hour. It was actually in 2 hours and when I called her out on it she just smirked.,3united-airlines,30/04/14,Do not take United flight from Honolulu to Guam. The plane and configuration used is for domestic flights plus there is no inflight entertainment. I fly business first all the time with United. This flight was nearly 8 hours and it was like flying with a 3rd world airline. Food was terrible. An unbelievable experience for an airline that generally does very well.,1united-airlines,30/04/14,Business class AMS-ORD-YVR. Check in went very smooth departure with 15 minutes delay due to air traffic control. I was seated in a window seat which was ok but if you want to get out of it you have to bother your neighbor. Flight attendants were quite old no youngsters like on flights with KLM. Food selection and service were good. Also the inflight entertainment was sufficient. With a small delay we landed at ORD. The flight to YVR was not special in business. Snack was below average and seat is medium. Overall satisfying and would do it again for the price.,7us-airways,15/11/13,Been flying US Airways for a couple years now and have had nothing but the best of experiences. I base my review by comparing it to my experiences with other airlines - they are in my opinion the most organized airline. My goal when flying is to get from point A to point B and be somewhat on time. With US Airways my flights have always been as scheduled. Seats are a bit more spacious than with other airlines too. I could not care less if the staff had a smile on their faces or not. Maybe they are like us and are having a bad day every now and again.,10us-airways,06/11/13,Flew from San Francisco to Jacksonville FL. Flight crew acted like they hated their job never smiled once poor leg room and no onboard amenities except a glass of water or coke. At least Delta gives you a cookie. Pay extra for JetBlue they have by far superior service.,1united-airlines,29/04/14,Flew TLV-EWR-SFO and back flights were on time boarding was smooth crew were pleasant and friendly. Food standard airplane but served hot. Experience from flying with other airlines we came equipped with movies books on our tablets.,6united-airlines,28/04/14,Flight from Fort Lauderdale to St Johns with connecting flight in Newark. Left Fort Lauderdale late ran to connecting flight with less than 15 mins to spare flight ended up 4 hours delayed but was never updated online or any departure board. Connecting flight Eventually cancelled because of fog in Newfoundland all though other family members arrived home on Air Canada and Westjet without the fog being an issue. They did give us a toiletry bag to take back to hotel we paid for. No apology but was put on a 6 am flight following morning. Terrible service and flights with no entertainment or compensation.,1us-airways,05/11/13,LHR-CLT-CMH-PHL-LHR. Transatlantic legs in Envoy Suites domestic in First. Was really very pleasantly surprised with the whole trip. The Envoy suites are very comfortable fully flat and private (particularly if you get the individual window seats) and are in fact very similar to AAs new business class flat beds on their new B777-300s or Qatars B787. However the US Airways seats are clearly a more budget version with smaller TV screens etc (but just as comfy for sleeping). Reasonable selection of films and the food was not bad at all. Excellent value- Booked less than a week before departure and this was the same price (slightly less in fact) as a full price Premium Economy fair on BA so absolutely no competition and would choose again without hesitation.,8us-airways,05/11/13,"October 29th Boston to Charlotte flight 657. Do you have any idea how rude the ""customer service"" representatives are in Charlotte? I have had two separate experiences with them in the past couple of months and I am just dumbfounded by it. We approached the Customer service desk where 3 employees were virtually filing their nails. They didn't say hello they didn't smile. They weren't helpful. It was almost like they were aggravated to have to deal with us.",6united-airlines,28/04/14,My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.,1united-airlines,28/04/14,"LHR-EWR: sat on tarmac at LHR for 3 hours before being informed the flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue. United tried to re-book us on a flight 24 hours later and only after considerable effort did they find us seats on a (half empty) BA departure. EWR-HR: Flight was overbooked so without asking us we were ""upgraded"" to Ec. Plus. The net result of which was I lost my aisle seat for a middle. I would have preferred to stay in Ec but was not consulted before being moved. The check-in staff at both LHR and EWR are easily the rudest I have ever come across. Also United don't have on-demand entertainment (someone please tell them its 2014 not 2004) and the seats are uncomfortable and narrow. Unless there is a massive price premium please take my advice and fly with a different airline.",1us-airways,05/11/13,I have been flying for over 50 years and I can honestly say that my recent round trip flight on US Airways from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv was the worst airline experience I have ever had. The first leg of this trip was from Los Angeles to Philadelphia when I got on the plane I looked around to plug in my earphones to hear some music but the stewardess informed me that this flight did not have any way to either listen to music or watch a video. In addition all food had to be purchased. The second leg of the trip was a 12 hour flight from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv. The TV screen on the back of the seat in front of me did not work and when I told the steward he attempted to fix it but he was unsuccessful consequently I sat in a cramped seat for over 12 hours with no music or video. When they served breakfast there were two choices: eggs or blintzes - I asked for eggs but I was told that they were out of eggs and when I asked the steward to check the other aisle to see if there were any eggs left he became angry. Unfortunately the blintzes were covered with a sickeningly sweet jam which made them inedible. I will never fly US Airways again.,1us-airways,01/11/13,Flew BNA-CLT-PVD. Overall I had good flights and didn't really experience any problems myself but the airplanes themselves are old and you can tell in the interior. Gogo wireless was a nice touch but it wasn't always reliable and was also a bit pricey - $17 for a day pass? The fact that they overbook bothers me. I saw families get bumped in CLT and didn't think that was a good business practice; only giving folks a $300 voucher for it isn't really helping their case though I suppose it's better than no voucher.,6united-airlines,27/04/14,I recently booked a flight to Denver from Kansas City trip cost was $376 avoiding other airports I wanted a one way flight to and fro. Price went to $925. Then while boarding the flight we have a prop plane. The seats were so narrow and of course no air-conditioning. The flight took an exceptionally long time back and forth from Kansas to Denver. I don't understand the United Airline Magazine says how their improving the flight for the customer. I think its time the execs take a flight cause your badly mistaken.,1united-airlines,27/04/14,March flights. We were a party of 6 and it was the first time flying United. We flew from Toronto connecting in Chicago and ending up in New Orleans. First they were an hour late taking off. The pilot said they were contracting out the baggage handling so they were slowly putting one bag at a time on the conveyor. As a result we missed the connection in Chicago. Then 3 (or 4 - I lost count) gate changes and delays. The we boarded then de-boarded. They didn't want to assign seats for 3 of our party even though I had bought and paid for the flights 11 months before they over-book and weren't sure 3 of us would make the flight. Finally arrived in New Orleans 6 hours later than scheduled. Of course we weren't seated together. Return flight - one of our party didn't get a seat at all. Had to take a later flight and all that entails.,1us-airways,25/10/13,We will never fly US Airways again after this experience. The first three legs of our journey were OK - average service but on-time arrivals but the last leg was a nightmare. Our flight was cancelled after a 4-hour delay and while cancellations happen to all airlines the way US Airways handled this one was appalling. Gate agents could not operate their own ticketing system to rebook passengers baggage was delivered two hours late and to a carousel in a different terminal and US Airways employees had no idea what was going on and were generally indifferent to passenger needs. We were traveling with an infant yet were given a hotel 15 minutes away when there was another hotel connected to the airport that other families received. Overall just a complete disaster in terms of customer service.,2us-airways,22/10/13,We flew GLA-PHL on time with good service then the PHL-MCO connection was delayed due to a crew member being late 30-45mins delay. After a wonderful holiday in Orlando checked in at 11.30 in good time for our 3.05 flight to PHL then went through security and to the gate departure screens said our flight would be delayed to 4.20 so it would not arrive in PHL until 18.20. Told we would miss our connection to GLA leaving at 18.40pm. They told us that the problem was another crew related issue! They rebooked us on plane departing PHL at 21.55 and arriving LHR at 10.00 the next morning then book us on a British Airways flight to GLA leaving at 12.10 arriving at 13.55 we would have originally been in GLA at 7.00 am but did not arrive till 14.00pm. When questioned US Airways said that there compensation policy is to just rebook passengers ASAP on the next flight available. The plane going from MCO-PHL an A330 did not have any inflight entertainment on this route despite having seat back TV's. That happened to be the same plane taking us to LHR but on that journey there was in-flight entertainment. So would not use US again unless desperate and would not recommend. Otherwise BA gave superb service on their flight and would defiantly recommend.,5united-airlines,27/04/14,Just returned from USA. SYD-SFO-LV-NY-SFO-SYD. Overall very good experience - travelling with 3 others inc 2 Children. Upgraded both international legs to economy Plus - makes a world of difference. Staff on Board were very welcoming (not OTT but very professional). Only gripe was that after a late Arrival NY-SFO it was announced that for those connecting to Sydney Australia that plane was being held (there were about 10 of us) and that we needed to proceed to International Gate 102. We all arrived there as quick as possible only to be told the plane was not going to wait and never was. The delay ex NY was not a UA issue - ground staff at Newark. Anyway - proceeded back to Customer Service desk where a fantastic attendant was very helpful provided us with a comp at the Crown Plaza near Airport and gave us some comfort packs. With 777 aircraft replacing 747 ex Sydney United will get my business again (at the right price).,7united-airlines,25/04/14,"After a 20 min delay during the first part of our trip we arrived in Charlotte only to be told we had to race across the entirety of the airport in less that 15 mins (which would have been feasible if we had the full 35+ mins). We managed to reach the gate 6 mins prior to the 'last' boarding call but they had ""closed the doors for an early departure"" and refused to allow my wife and I onto the plane. They then directed us to go all the way back across the Airport to get lower quality and separate seats on a much later flight. They attempted no form of compensation or even an apology and acted as if it were our fault and that they were doing us a favor by 'allowing' us to get the terrible seats. The worst of it though is their claim to be both Military and Handicap friendly but they fail in both.",1us-airways,22/10/13,PHL-PBI was the last leg on my first-class round trip to and from PSP. I had boarded USAir in Palm Springs that morning and flew to Phoenix. So far so good. Then I flew Phoenix to Philadelphia. That's where it all fell apart. I was stranded at Philadelphia airport by US Airways when their last flight of the day departed early leaving 3 connecting passengers abandoned. Dealing with the brick wall that is the US Airways customer service staff my treatment was shameful disrespectful and costly. USAir refused to rebook me because my reservation had been made via United Airlines. United told me that since my reservation was a First Class Mileage Award the first compatible seat they could rebook me on was next Monday (5 days hence)! Consequently I had to put myself up at the Sheraton in Philadelphia for the night and pay $508 to buy a one-way ticket from PHL-PBI. Adding insult to expensive injury the flight I was supposed to take was first-class non-stop. This one-way rip-off ticket was in coach and had a layover in Charlotte. On just this website alone and going back only about 8 weeks I have encountered reviews of no less than a dozen passengers who have been stranded or treated miserably in Philadelphia by USAir. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is my belief that when an airline accepts your ticket to get from point A to point B that it assumes its share of responsibility for getting their passengers to their destination. I had already flown 2 out of the 3 legs of my flight that day. Departing early and stranding three connecting passengers is unconscionable.,us-airways,22/10/13,Flew from PHL to DEN round trip Oct. 17 returning Oct. 20. Upgraded on the flight to Denver and coach returning to Philadelphia. Both flights were on time and just as importantly the cabin crew were professional and overall did a good job. On the flight to PHL there was a medical emergency and the crew kept the passengers informed - as much as they could - regarding what was going on. Overall good experience. People complain there's no IFE on US. Bring a book or your tablet to watch a movie.,6united-airlines,24/04/14,Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down. Probably the least service-centred flight I ever experienced. United Airlines is an airline that I will use in the future only when I can't afford the alternatives.,3united-airlines,23/04/14,Flew from Okinawa Japan with final destination at D.C. Dulles (IAD) with stops at Narita (NRT)-Tokyo and Chicago O'Hare-ORD. Flight from Okinawa to Tokyo is always through ANA since United contracts them out to and from Tokyo to Okinawa. I then flew a 747 Economy Plus from NRT to ORD. Waste of money to upgrade to Economy Plus. A little more leg room and width but that is it. Food and drink service was the same (not much) so can't recommend this. No personal entertainment (was all on the big screen). Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money. Seats felt tight and cramped and I noticed absolutely no under the seat room for bags or stretching out? Onboard departure was chaotic as people couldn't store their luggage in overhead bins.,2us-airways,22/10/13,My 92-year-old father flew from Denver to Asheville NC and when we got to Denver there was a guy at the ticket counter who helped my dad with his ticket luggage and wheelchair. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. The lady who came with the wheelchair was a nice and patient as she could be with him. He reported later that all personnel with US Airways were very attentive and helpful in getting him through the airport. They may have been bad in the past but this time they were the best airline I've seen.,10us-airways,20/10/13,Flew GLA-PHL-MCO and return. Excellent in every way Seats and legroom were good food was the usual economy food but does me fine check-in was quick and simple staff pleasant and flights on time what more can I ask for. Only down side was the video screens I was in window seat and couldn't see it properly but didn't bother me that much really. Would fly with them again no problem.,10united-airlines,23/04/14,"Flight on April 22 2014 was delayed and then cancelled. After sitting and being told the takeoff was being delayed 3x they finally cancelled the flight. Announcing casually that it was cancelled and everyone needed to go to Customer Service. No warning. No ""We are really sorry."" No approaching the customer to help us out.",2us-airways,20/10/13,LHR-CLT-TPA-CLT-LHR. All flights left on time flights on the international leg is an A330-300 which is a good aircraft 2-4-2 seat configuration large seat back screens for showing a good selection of movies. TV shows games etc seating was ok with good legroom on all the flights. My only complaint is the food both ways the offering was chicken with rice or pasta surely they can come up with more choice than this also a muffin for breakfast is not much to offer. One other gripe I have but this is not exclusively US airways but all American carriers why are passengers allowed to take such large baggage in the cabin some suitcases were bigger than mine that went in the hold. Generally I was pleased with the service I got on all flights and would use US airways again for future travel.,9us-airways,20/10/13,"BCN to JAX rtn via PHL. Philadelphia Airport seems to come in for a lot of stick on this forum but you can only speak as you find and my wife and I found it a very pleasant improvement to the likes of JFK MIA and LAX as regards transfers. More space and less like a cattle market. Paid to go in the US Club which was very pleasant and well worth twenty odd dollars. Only waited 5 mins to clear immigration which is far less than anywhere else we've encountered in the States. As for US Airways well we've now been on all of the ""big four"" in the last couple of years (first time with US) and to be honest I really cannot see any difference in any of them. In all four in economy space is getting tighter and tighter and food/drink on offer is getting less and less and poorer and poorer quality. But if people want low fares then there's the rub I guess. At least US run modern planes (A-330 200's) on this route with Emb 175 on the domestic sector far better than poky CRJ's etc. The Airbus is far better than the triple sevens or the ancient 747s or 767s used by some and at least if you are travelling as a couple you just get two seats and don't have to share. AVOD in all seats which is better than many. Overall still miles behind people like Air New Zealand but they are only of any use if you want somewhere out West. In short as long as you don't expect luxury from any of these American giants you won't be disappointed. I'm getting to regard them as a bigger Ryanair ie just a cost effective way of getting from A to B.",6united-airlines,23/04/14,I've had an awful experience both times I've flown with United. The first time all my flights were over booked and delayed. (Two flights there and back due to connections.) They gave us very little information about why and were extremely pushy when finally getting us to board the plane. We spent a long time sitting in the plane after being boarded with no explanation before we finally took off. They offered compensation to take a later flight but I had already been delayed for 2+ hours! On the more recent flight the flight was overbooked and I was unable to get on. There were no other flights out of YYC to SEA and I ended up having to cancel my trip. They have not been helpful when I tried to contact them. They told me they were transferring me to International Customer Service but I was just disconnected! I would not recommend United. Avoid them if you can!,1united-airlines,22/04/14,I can honestly say this was the worst trip I have had in 20 years. Seat allocation is by far the worst especially if you are travelling with children. Chances of getting seats together are slim. My 11 year old wasn't even allocated a seat regardless how many times we tried online prior to flying and we booked last June. After a lot of stress got a seat but not together. They over book all flights and offer people compensation if they take another flight. Or offer you an upgrade to get all seats together as they tried with us for an extraÂ£Â£80 each. As someone said to us on the flight was that they are only after money. As regards to check in at Heathrow. What a mess. All electronic to get boarding passes. It was like a bun fight. United make a big thing about there new systems and app but have forgotten the most important thing. The customer. Luggage. Make sure each bag is under weight. As they don't take into account overall weight. Tried to charge us Â£150 for 1 bag over by 2 lbs. We transferred it to a lighter bag. As I said before only interested in the money. They could learn a thing or too from EasyJet as regards to seating. The food was good is the only positive experience. I would never use again.,2us-airways,20/10/13,Horrible customer service. Slow staff and tight connections don't mix. Not accommodating or apologetic whatsoever for missed flights in a tight connection they allow but shouldn't if the whole process of getting from one flight to another will take so long. Closed the flight early with no announcement that I could hear as I was rushing to the gate. They knew I wasn't on board and my bag was or wasn't. Probably had plenty of standby passengers to take my place. Waste of time. Fly a real airlines and don't bother with these dinosaurs.,1us-airways,18/10/13,So many bad points that I'm not sure they will all fit! 1) Do not pay for 'preferred' access. I forget exactly what the name is but I paid$ 31 for this in order to board the airplane 'early' but was told by the attendant that it didn't mean anything just go by the zone number. 2) The food ran out and I was told I could pre-order but when I tried to do this for my return flight I couldn't as the website only listed the food but there wasn't a way to actually order and pay for it. 3) This has already been said but the seats are extremely uncomfortable. I purchased seats by the window so I could lean against them to sleep as I had to travel from the UK to AZ. In total I paid an additional $267 for these seats but I shouldn't have bothered as the space between the seat and the window was so far that I couldn't lean against it at all. 4) The return plane 'broke down' and so we had to wait approximately 4 extra hours this was at night and the airline graciously gave us a $10 voucher for a meal while we waited but the voucher was only good for shops in the airport but it was so expensive all I was able to buy was a bottle of water and a bag of chips. 4) Because of the plane braking down I was going to miss the coach (bus) in London that would take me home and I had already paid for it. I will never travel on US Airways again.,1united-airlines,22/04/14,I am sitting in First EWR-LHR so can't complain too much but I'm shocked at how a global first customer is treated. First I had to argue with the gate agent at the entrance to the global first/global services lobby who said I was not allowed in. I pointed out that I was flying global first 3 times and then demanded that we ask the people inside who said I was of course welcome. After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services. I know now why I usually just take Lufthansa and connect through Germany for their grace and ease. It is amply clear that we million miler 1k fliers just aren't worth much at united. Why bother being loyal.,5united-airlines,22/04/14,My flight out of Austin to San Francisco was delayed over an hour which caused me to miss my next flight. That flight was the last one out of SF for the night. The 3 people at the counter in Austin told me bluntly that there would be no compensation for the fact that I was going to stay the night sleeping in the terminal in SF. When I arrived in SF I went to the counter in Terminal 1 looking to get my boarding pass for the next day. I was handed hotel and food vouchers. I use United because they're the only carrier out of my smallish town (Chico CA) and before getting that voucher I had promised myself never to use United and to drive the almost 2 hours to Sacramento to use another carrier.,10us-airways,18/10/13,"Flight from OAK-PHX-PIT. Wasn't supposed to change planes in PHX but they changed that. Took my boarding pass in OAK and refused to reprint one in Phoenix told me that's too bad for you and ""not my problem"". Fortunately I printed two and the gate attendant snarked at me saying ""well aren't you just smarter than the rest of us!"" Continued on to PIT and requested a Kosher meal since I'm lactose intolerant. What do they bring me? Ham and cheese!",us-airways,16/10/13,PHL-MCO 15 October 2013 on 757. Very tired plane could do with an update but the airline have got new planes on order so it maybe replaced. Service ok. Nothing special but did what was required. Cabin crew very pleasant. Happy to recommend. Only downfall no IFE.,7us-airways,16/10/13,MAN-PHL 15 October 2013 on an A330 great plane. IFE good with good selection of programs and movies etc cabin crew very attentive and very pleasant. Would be happy to recommend. Meals very good we had a vegetarian and kids in the party and all where catered for very well.,8united-airlines,21/04/14,My first trip to Asia IAD-SFO-ICN (Seoul Incheon) and back. A319 from IAD to SFO was small first class seats were old and not great. FA's were good food was OK Flew global first on a 747 to Seoul. Toilets stopped working half way through the flight and we landed in Osaka for repairs. Delayed my trip by two hours but the crew handled it well. Return flights was upstairs in business first seat was narrow but not bad IFE was good food was also good. SFO to IAD on a 757-200 that had to be 25 years old with CRT IFE from 1990. FA's were excellent but the plane needs to be retired. Overall a good trip and I truly think once United modernizes its fleet it needs to decide if it wants to compete with the foreign carriers. If so maybe a few less seats in business class get away from 2-4-2 configuration and perhaps better first class seating in the domestic fleet.,8united-airlines,21/04/14,I fly with United because it is one the few alternatives to fly directly to Bogota. They do not respect the seat assignments. On 2 occasions they changed without explanation even though I had paid for economy plus set they sent me to the back I had to really fight to get one in economy plus. On a 5 hour international flight they give you nothing just a drink. No entertainment.,2us-airways,15/10/13,Flew from Halifax to Philadelphia to Dublin return. Regional jet from YHZ. On-time with the normal drink service. An older 767 from Philadelphia to Dublin in Envoy. Good service wonderful meals- likely the best airline I have flown for the quantity of food - you are not left hungry. Choice of 4 meals and a hot breakfast choice too. On time and overall good. Return to Philadelphia on the same aircraft in Envoy. Really great service and food was outstanding. Philadelphia to Halifax on a new Embraer and very comfortable. Overall this airline does a great job in my experience (this was my second trip to Dublin this year with them). And a very nice touch with the menus being in English and Gaelic.,9us-airways,13/10/13,Very inconvenient. They have a smart phone app that you can do everything on except print a boarding pass. When you arrive at the airport you have to either go to the regular or wait in the self serve kiosk line both of which are very long. We checked in on the app had to wait in line to get a boarding pass so we could check our bags. Bag fees are $25 each. If you want a choice of seats that is $45 per person. If you want expedited boarding that is another $25 per person. Our flight was about 2 1/2 hours long. We were not offered snacks to purchase. We got one tiny cup of water/soda half filled with ice and then another cup of coffee or water for that entire time. Bring water or a beverage and food with you. The seats are very uncomfortable for a person who is short is stature they do not fit the neck properly and you cannot recline far enough to be comfortable.,united-airlines,19/04/14,"I flew First Class on UA14 HNL-EWR. The plane was clean and the entertainment system was excellent. The food however was inedible. What they called ""chicken cacciatore"" was really a piece of cardboard. I have had better food in Coach on other airlines. Service on the flight was de minimus. The flight crew seemed only interested in finishing the pitiful dinner service as quickly as possible. Nobody flies for the food but United sets the bar for the worst food and catering in the industry. I thought Delta had poor food (which they do) but by comparison they look pretty good.",3united-airlines,16/04/14,As a long time Continental customer and I really am trying to like United but they sure make it difficult. This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.,5us-airways,09/10/13,The pilot claimed to have have miscalculated his fuel needs of Flight US3280 leaving San Antonio to Charlotte and so about 10 minutes outside of Charlotte needed to make an emergency stop at Spartanburg to get fuel. After approximately 30 minutes on the ground we were told we had fuel and would be taking off shortly ten minutes later the pilot announced that he had again miscalculated our fuel need so we needed to wait for another fuel truck to give us even more fuel. After about a total delay of an hour we finally got back in the air and arrived in Charlotte at which time all the passengers who had missed connecting flights were sent to various hotels to await morning flights. I left Charlotte the next morning at 9.30 for Minneapolis my final destination still outraged by the seeming unconcern for the needless danger that this pilot and crew had for the safety and convenience of the passengers.,us-airways,09/10/13,A friend and I recently traveled from Louisville to Philadelphia to Barcelona. The initial flight (9/26/13) was fine. On the return trip from Barcelona to Louisville (10/6/13) the situation was very difficult. We were late leaving Barcelona so there was necessarily a rush through Customs and Security. We already had our boarding passes confirmed from the day before. When we arrived on time at the Philadelphia gate to go on to Charlotte our seats had been given away. What raises questions for us is that when we deplaned in Philadelphia an agent handed us a possible change of flights. Was that because our seats were already given away or because we had to go through Customs etc. and it was unlikely that we would make it?,6united-airlines,16/04/14,LAX-NRT-LAX (en-route to BKK) BizFirst on UA's new 787. Service both directions was really top notch. The crew were professional and attentive and on both legs the International Service Co-ordinator came to personally thank each passenger for their business and for choosing United (I thought that added a very nice touch). Meals were actually quite good and the wine parings worked well. Opted for the Japanese meal on the return and found it pleasantly delicious (including the array of sushi appetizers). The best thing about the trip was the aircraft. Arrived refreshed and didn't feel like I'd spent 12 hours in an airplane upon landing. Would recommend flying the a/c wherever possible. Overall high marks for this flight.,9united-airlines,16/04/14,Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5). On a full plane it means that the overhead bins will be full when you embark and you will be deny boarding with your carry-ons. They will be checked at the gate of the aircraft. It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them. Their service is light years ahead of United. And when you pay a premium for a Virgin seat you have real perks coming with it. Not bait and deceit.,1us-airways,07/10/13,Philadelphia to Tel Aviv in economy on A 330-200. This is the 3rd time I used US Air's direct flight for my home town Philadelphia to Tel Aviv The plane was new and the seats had adequate leg room. I prefer the 2x4x2 seating configuration on the A 330 over the 2x5x2 or 3x3x3 configuration of the B777. The on demand entertainment system had a good list of programing. The food was not very good but that is to be expected and they ran out of one of the breakfast options on the return flight. The best part of the flight though were the flight attendants. They were very friendly and professional.,7us-airways,07/10/13,Flight from CLT to Dublin on a 20 year plus 757-200 in economy. Just like sitting on a bus and the service was poor. On return trip upgraded to Envoy class and other then larger seats the service and food offerings were not one would expect for the additional cost. Maybe the CEO of this airline needs to take some anonymous trips so he can experience the poor customer service this airline provides. No doubt the CLT to DUB is a money maker for them as the service is poor the aircraft old the seats uncomfortable and the flight attendants non accommodating.,1united-airlines,16/04/14,Most excruciating flight I have endured was the 757 UA flight from Newark to Oslo on 5 April. The seats in economy were sadistically cramped. The aisle was so narrow that the crew could not move their carts without repeatedly banging and bumping into passenger seats. United's utter contempt for its customers and its crews is all too evident in its creation of such a tortuous experience. United has finally jumped the shark in the cheap cheesy penny-pinching department. I can choose to fly another airline and believe me I will.,1united-airlines,15/04/14,"This was our worst experience. United Airlines had already been the airline with the most customer complaints and proved to be true when we took a trip to Florida. On the way back our flight for 3pm had been delayed for 5pm and then was cancelled due to ""maintenance issues."" We took another flight for 8pm and again was delayed to 9.30pm. We asked the lady at the counter and she said that the cabin crew wasn't prepared for travel so they delayed the flight. They are disorganized and I will never be flying United again.",1us-airways,07/10/13,JFK-CLT-RDU return in early October 2013. US Air isn't officially a budget carrier but the vibe certainly was budget. Basic amenities no IFE limited cash menu. Service was OK but not very efficient.,5us-airways,07/10/13,My husband and I were on US Air flight from Phoenix to Boston. The agent at the gate closed the door 7 minutes before the official departure time. We were already at the gate as he was closing it and he refused to let us on. The reason we were delayed were long lines at check-in the computer system not being able to find our legitimate reservation another long line to speak with a live agent followed by a long line at security. The worst element of this experience was the smugness of the agent when he refused to let us on the plane. I'm a frequent business traveler I fly every week (and have been doing it for the past 10 years).,united-airlines,15/04/14,United Express: I flew from ORD to ASE in March and although they have us over a barrel as they are the only airline with non- stops the flight wasn't bad. We had to cram into a little regional jet definitely much smaller than United's traditional mainline aircraft but it was a relatively new plane. The seats did seem smaller but the service was jut about the same as its big brother. The fare was on the high side though.,10united-airlines,15/04/14,"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam. The economy plus seating is better than normal economy though although I'm not sure it compares favorably with other airlines' economy.",5us-airways,03/10/13,My husband and I have just returned from a trip to the States flying from Manchester UK to San Francisco via Philadelphia then back from Seattle to Manchester. We arrived on time with baggage as one expects but the cabin service experience was poor particularly on the return transatlantic leg. The A330 has an outdated interior and insufficient lavatories. The seat back entertainment was difficult to use and the meals very small. The banana muffin and nothing else for breakfast was a joke. The crew were embarrassed to serve it. Only water juice and tea were available and no coffee. We have travelled to the Far East several times in recent years and the service provided by Emirates and especially Singapore Airlines was far superior.,6us-airways,03/10/13,"I stopped flying this airline years ago for all the reasons cited in this forum. However I was convinced by my travel agent to reconsider and booked a round trip flight from PHL to DUB. Delays and mechanical issues are par for the course with this airline and they didn't ""disappoint."" Take off from PHL was delayed three hours. But what has convinced me to never fly with them again is the treatment by the flight crew during both the delay and the flight. I have never experienced a more miserable and inattentive crew in all of my years of flying. What justification does this company have for treating customers in this way? What an awful experience. I will not fly with them again ever.",united-airlines,14/04/14,HNL to BKK. Aborted take off in HNL. Plane back to ramp sit inside plane for 5 hours. Problem could not be fixed mechanical. Flight cancelled. Told to disembark get out luggage at Arrivals and go to Departure area to rebook. This on a 747 with 350 plus people on it - all pulling their luggage about 1/2 mile to Departure area. Line up at departure area United to re-book - wait 7 hours to get to counter. Only 2 staff members to rebook the entire airplane. I was put on Delta the next day to NRT. Gave me $10 voucher for meals and over night free stay in Waikiki hotel. Cheapest meal at hotel was $18. Next AM Delta took off on time got me to TKO then transfer to United back to BKK. Never again with United!,1united-airlines,14/04/14,I flew from DCA-EWR on Monday April 14. It was a mess United cancelled all of its flight out of DC without any reason. The weather was perfect my flight was suppose to be at 11.30am they cancelled it then I was put on the 4.30pm which was delayed and finally at 6.30pm they decided to cancel. They don't think of their passengers they don't respect their time this airline is really the worst airline I've ever flown. Would not recommend.,1us-airways,03/10/13,My husband and I went to Aruba for our honeymoon a few weeks ago. We will never fly with them again! The middle of July comes around and we receive a phone call from US Airways saying they cancelled the flight we booked so we needed to choose a different flight. The only two options available were to either leave and come back the same dates but the travel time was 2 days worth each way or to leave a day early and get a hotel to be able to make it on the next flight leaving the following morning. The second option was our only reasonable choice out of the two. By leaving a day early this meant that my husband and I were going to have to miss an additional day's worth of work. We asked the agent if we could be compensated with a free hotel stay or for our bags and her answer was no. When we get to the baggage check in counter they tell us that we still need to pay for our bags. We stood there arguing with them that we already paid for our bags online. 30 minutes later this was finally straightened out. On our way back from Aruba we ran into the same issue with baggage fees (which we ended up having to pay for twice). We fly into Philadelphia to find out that our flight to Chicago has been delayed 5 hours which puts us getting into Chicago at around 2.00 am. We still had a flight to get on out of Chicago at 8.00 am. They apologize and said it was a staffing issue and that there were no other flights leaving the airport except that one. This was our first and last time with this airline!,us-airways,24/09/13,I was flying from NYC to Dublin Ireland today with a stopover in Philadelphia. There were no problems with my flight from NYC to Philly however that's where the luck ran out. There was an issue with downsizing the aircraft at Philly and so numerous passengers were left stranded I had been told I may have to wait for another flight tomorrow - which thankfully was not the case in the end. Having finally made it onto the flight and taking off an hour later than expected it didn't take much time to realise it was going to be a long journey home. The aircraft itself was tiny two lanes of 3 seats each which I have never encountered on an international flight before. It was cramped the food was awful and the attendants were difficult to deal with disgruntled and overall not welcoming in the slightest. I'm afraid US Airways won't be getting business from me again.,united-airlines,14/04/14,London Heathrow-Chicago O'Hare UA0929. Chicago Oâ€™Hare Intl-Denver UA1014 29th May 2013. Denver-Rapid City UA4914. Rapid City-Chicago Oâ€™Hare UA4414. Chicago Oâ€™Hare-London Heathrow UK. UA0938 23rd June 2013. I cannot understand United are not upping their care for its customers. We flew with United on our last holiday and quite honestly never again. We have flown to many places around the world and United without any doubt are the worst airline I have used. The cabin crew are lazy and somewhat rude doing as little as they can. They could not even ask for the window blinds to be raised when coming in to land at London Heathrow. They did a standard talk when we were on the plane (with a special welcome to our premium and military customers). So quite obviously the economy passengers do not matter remembering of course that it is economy passengers that are the bulk of their customers.,1united-airlines,13/04/14,We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.,1us-airways,24/09/13,Traveled from Honolulu-Phoenix and Phoenix-New York (JFK) which were both 5 plus hour flights. Economy seating on the first flight was cramped and uncomfortable and inflight crew were unfriendly. Felt more like an overnight bus service. Service on second flight was significantly better but aircraft didn't have any inflight entertainment - not even drop down screens. Chose US Airways due to the cost advantage but next time will spend extra in order to have a much better inflight experience and feel better at my final destination.,3us-airways,19/09/13,Flight was on time. Flew first class which was a mistake. Other than a little more leg room no real discernible difference than coach. Food was bad service was nowhere close to first class or business class. They had two meal selections but when they got to me there was only one. Mind you there were only 12 people in first class. There is absolutely no inflight entertainment. Very odd for a modern carrier. Flight attendant told me they got rid of inflight players because of the cost and weight. Seriously if that is why they got rid of it then they are apparently the only ones. If they are cutting costs that much I'd rather fly another airline who cares about the passenger experience. If flying coach probably ok if you get a really good deal. If business or first class definitely not worth it.,1united-airlines,11/04/14,"I recently was on a United flight from DFW to ORD with my two small children (3 years and 10 months). After takeoff it became necessary for me to change my daughter's diaper. I pressed the flight attendant button and told the man that I needed to utilize the restroom with my daughter but since the lavatory was so small it was impossible to bring my 3 year old son with me. I asked if he could keep an eye on him just to ensure he stayed seated. I was told very tersely that this was not his job and he couldn't possibly do such a thing. I tried contacting United and got the following response ""The flight attendants are not required to assist with these type of activities it is strictly up to the flight attendants."" If you offer no assistance for people traveling alone with multiple children perhaps you should make your customers aware of your flight attendants utter uselessness before they board a plane assuming they will be treated as valued customers.",1united-airlines,11/04/14,"SFO-LAX and LAX-LHR - in the recent past this airline has made my no-fly list for being unreliable to the point of fitting the description of ""not fit for purpose"" so I was reluctant to use them on this routing but had no choice as it was part of a Star Alliance mileage redemption. In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly. Couldn't ask for more so they're off my no-fly list and fingers crossed for a few more flights like this. All we need now is to get rid of the ghastly 90s photoshop globe with the wonky perspective and bring back the Saul Bass tulip.",9us-airways,15/09/13,Flew Philadelphia - Zurich in economy. Plane was a 767 exactly 26 years old. Quite run-down inside no in-flight entertainment. I sat in a 'window seat' yet there was no window. Apparently this is a quirk several of the front rows in the old 767s. Food was poor and very little. Guests are offered only a single glass of wine at no charge and this comes out of a paper bottle. Breakfast consisted of a nothing but a small banana muffin. Cabin crew never came around with water or snacks in between meals. In-flight entertainment was non existent. No magazines offered except for the US Airways magazine. Their airport Club lounges are little better than their actual flights. No food offered beyond chips and a few olives. Alcohol is strictly limited. I will try to avoid this airline at all costs particularly as the 767s are scheduled to be in service for another 4 years. Few airlines in the world (apart from the African ones) fly such old aircraft.,2us-airways,12/09/13,Flew Manchester to San Francisco via PHL. Plenty of leg room  seats comfortable food average (but I've had a lot worse). Slight delay at PHL due to thunderstorms. Very disappointed that PHL to SFO (5.5 hours) wasn't deemed worthy of inflight entertainment. This leg of the journey was made worse by the ridiculous attitude of so many UIS fliers who take so much baggage on the plane and then moan because there is no where to store it all. Never met so many rude and selfish people in a long time. Return leg was better lovely crews on both legs less whinging  penny pinching US flyers made it a nicer experience. Would use again.,7us-airways,11/09/13,Flying between Gulfport MS to New York City. Twice we were delayed due to maintenance. Flight attendants were not pleasant - they were absolutely rude to some foreign passengers. We were first class but had the worst service ever encountered on any airline! Now we are sitting in Charlotte with another delay due to maintenance. I have yet to hear anyone apologize or even care. I will not fly this airline if I can avoid it!,2united-airlines,10/04/14,First time when we used united airlines international connecting flight in San Francisco we notice their system are very disorganised in their terminal no one to help and most staff are not helpful. On another experience coming back from LAX going back to Sydney the staff at check were the same - all unhelpful. All they did was stand and talk among themselves.,1united-airlines,08/04/14,United Airlines was a disaster to travel through and not worth the amount of stress they cause all of their passengers. I was on a 7 hour flight and they had all movies and shows on repeat. The staff were very unhelpful. My flight ended up getting cancelled and I got re-routed to a much longer flight pattern. There were others I could have taken but United were SO unhelpful that I didn't find out until after the flight. The people there have no idea what they're doing. I was a day late for an important meeting. I received nothing in return for the inconvenience.,2us-airways,04/09/13,Booked to leave FLL to BOS for travel assignment with a connection in Charlotte. At the gate I was told I would need to check my bag because the flight was very full. After boarding it was discovered that there was a malfunction. Whilst waiting we were told there was another malfunction and there would be a 90 minute delay. We were let off the plane and then re-boarded. Put on another flight this time connecting through PHL. Another delay but we did get to PHL and left FLL prior to the reported time of departure. Got to PHL to find out that there was another delay a gate change and the flight we were set to take was no longer even on the departure board. Told to check the monitors for flight changes. Ended up sitting in PHL for another 90 minutes and the gate was filthy. Upon getting to PHL at approximately 1.45am we were told that our bags never left PHL. It is now 2.58 and our bags just arrived. I have traveled extensively domestically and this is by far the worst airline I have flown.,us-airways,04/09/13,We flew from Amsterdam to Los Angeles with a switch of planes in Philadelphia on 23/8-/2013. Flying back on 6/9/2013 and I must say we are not looking forward to our flight back. We are used to Delta and United and thought lets try US Airways this time around. The flight is quite long 8 hours and 4.45 hours. The seats were ok we had enough room as long as the person in front of us did not change his seat setting to lay down. The main thing is the plane we were in flew from Amsterdam to Philly with no personal entertainment it had overhead screens with poor quality video which you could hardly see from the window seat. I think for such long flights personal entertainment is a must have we were really disappointed and did not expect this especially not since we were used to all of that with Delta and United. So we arrived in Philly and the transfer to the new plane went well. We got on our new plane an A321 from Philly to LA. Flight time 4.45 minutes. Guess what no personal entertainment onboard not even an overhead screen. The crew were nice the food moderate but I will never fly with them again.,3us-airways,01/09/13,Manchester to Philadelphia and return August 2013. I can only assume that the negative comments on this forum come from a very small minority who have had a bad experience with US Airways or serial complainers as I can offer nothing but praise for my own family's recent flights with this airline. Our main consideration was how the seats would be for nearly eight hours and I have to say that they were very comfortable with a substantial amount of leg-room. The food on the way out was excellent not quite so good on the way back but still OK. The personal entertainment on offer was very impressive and the cabin staff polite and friendly. Flights were on time both ways. From my own experience I would certainly recommend this airline for transatlantic flights.,10united-airlines,07/04/14,SAN-IAH-AMS LHR-LAX-SAN in economy plus.

After the fifth time they changed out gate assignment and again the flight was delayed twice. After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids. The customer service lady gave us some vouchers for the food stores in the airport but the stores would not accept these vouchers.

Apparently had still been selling the flight at PHL even though massively over booked. In flight entertainment from the ninety's. Will never use them again. We were flying budget but still can't believe the poor level of service for a budget airline.,us-airways,19/08/13,It seems like some things never change since I ended up spending the night in the Philly airport last night. Came in from Punta Cana on a US Airways flight which was delayed getting to Punta Cana. Our flight ended up leaving over an hour late from Punta Cana even though we were told it would only be a half hour delayed. Once arrived in Philly we ran to the gate from security and ended up missing the flight to Tampa. The plane was still at the gate but we were told it was too late. We went to customer service where they did nothing but give me a boarding pass for a flight at 8am the next morning. They claimed it wasn't the airlines fault we missed our connection since our original US Airways flight was delayed. Had to sleep in the Philly airport. US Airways you disappointed me yet again.,united-airlines,06/04/14,United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.,1united-airlines,02/04/14,Very disappointed with my experience with United on Feb 2014. Had a first flight that was oversold we couldn't get on the plane. Had to be re-routed and got 3 flights instead of 2 originally scheduled to arrive at 9 pm instead of 4.30 pm to destination. We found out prior to our last flight that we had not been properly booked into the flight had to be changed to another flight again after an hour of waiting at the understaffed customer service desk. At destination now trying to confirm our seats for the return flight. It's been cancelled! We've tried to call customer service after a 20 minutes wait we're told that we need to be transferred to international flight dept. Another 20 minute wait. Another transfer. We ended up waiting 2hours. Very poor service.,1us-airways,19/08/13,Out of the big US carriers this one is my favourite. Will miss it as it becomes American and thus a One World partner. The plane on the Atlanta - Hartford (via Charlotte) route was a relatively new A320. I find their first class to have the most legroom out of all the US carriers. The meal was decent and the service at least pleasant. Their wifi system also worked very well.,7us-airways,18/08/13,My girlfriend and I flew from YHZ-PHL-BDA in First Class last month. All flight attendants were friendly and provided the best service with the limited product that they could. All flights were on time and there were no baggage issues. No meal on any flight and zero in flight entertainment on any flight. Drinks were served in plastic cups in First Class. The seats were fine but US Airways needs to be put out of their misery. I hope that the merger with American goes ahead and the service on the merged airline is stepped up because right now the domestic/ North American product on US Airways is two-star not three. It is a pastime in Canada to complain about the service on Air Canada. I would encourage everyone who complains about Air Canada to fly with US Airways they will realize how lucky we are to have Air Canada.,2united-airlines,02/04/14,I recently flew First Class on United # 15 from Newark to Honolulu. This is a 10+ hour non stop flight. The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland. My advice to people traveling on United is to bring your own food even in First Class!,5united-airlines,01/04/14,Flew SFO to PEK on 29th March in First and we had an exceptional crew. I'm not normally one to post positive reviews about United but they deserve this one. We found all flight attendants to be friendly eager to assist and they tried their best to meet all requests. The food was tasty and served at the appropriate temperature. It's still not exactly an elegant service but it's good.,9us-airways,14/08/13,"We flew Boston-Philly-Zurich and back. All flights were on time. All personnel both in the airports an on the flights were competent and pleasant. The food considering it was ""airplane food"" was decent. The seats were a little cramped but typical for economy class. In general we had a very positive experience.",8us-airways,14/08/13,1788 CLT to ORD. This is definitely the worst airline. Every flight is delayed. Never taken off on time in the last 3 years. Add to that the rude staff at the counter who usually don't have any information. They keep blaming everything on 'inbound aircraft.' And this is at the hub Charlotte where they have plenty of aircraft's to redeploy.,1united-airlines,01/04/14,"I was a loyal and frequent Continental flyer for a number of years. All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on ""the"" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt. Too unreliable.",1united-airlines,01/04/14,Second time in 25 days connection return flight layover +3 hours plus delayed takeoff by 3 hours out of O'Hare. This time there wasn't even any weather issues. Also both trips had cancellations and overbooking. Why bother paying for poor service when I can actually drive home faster.,1us-airways,13/08/13,London Heathrow travel outbound through Charlotte NC return through Philadelphia. Both ways a fairly new Airbus A330-300 with great entertainment system and average seating for transatlantic economy class. Our issues with US Airways is not with their international service it is with their horrific domestic service and the worst customer service experience imaginable. We live less than 2 hours from the Philadelphia airport and spent twice as much time as we did on the plane from London Heathrow to our home. They're cancelled all flights to our local airport and after 13 hours in an airport less than 2 hours from our home we had to rent a car (at our own expense) to drive home because US Airways cannot complete a transaction. This has happened now 3 times. Avoid Philadelphia completely and be warned that US Airways customer service will treat you horribly.,us-airways,13/08/13,The plane was old all toilets except one in first class stopped working 2 hours before we landed on a transatlantic flight from Philadelphia to Athens Greece. The food was not edible the flight attendants were rude! The entertainment system was ancient and the movie stopped 3/4 of the way and could not continue. My nephew traveled a few days earlier and had similar complaints. My worst transatlantic flight in the 50+ years I've been going back and forth!,1united-airlines,31/03/14,I just returned from a flight from Chicago (ORD) to Tampa (TPA) for spring break. I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs. I was unable to get any help from management customer service.,1united-airlines,31/03/14,I flew from Heathrow to Charleston (SC) via Washington Dulles for vacation in late March. I flew UA123 which was a B757-200. This was an old plane but it had great AVOD and leg space and the staff were friendly. The flight was also early and very empty which is always a plus. The connections were typical subsidiary small airline service; nothing special nothing bad and on time. On my return from Washington our B777-2000 was delayed due to a fuel problem however the entertainment system was left on so we could finish our film. After a 45min delay the plane left and made up the time coming back across the Atlantic. This plane was half-empty and had been recently refurbished with a great AVOD system and spacious seating. Cabin crew were very helpful. I would definitely recommend United on the Heathrow - Washington route.,7us-airways,12/08/13,GVA-FRA-CLT-BOS on 1 August. I am tall 196 cm. Surprisingly the flight FRA CLT was comfortable the seat pitch was ok I didn't put my legs on the aisle. Flight on time. The second flight was delayed 1 hour due to weather conditions which was totally understandable. Return was SFO-PHL-ZRH here I was lucky to have on the both flights the bulkhead seats which have a lot of space. The food was average but this is not an important factor for me. Generally I had a very good experience with US Airways!,9us-airways,11/08/13,SEA-CLT-HHH return. Not a single flight was on time. Crews were indifferent at best and otherwise berating their employer to passengers. Their primary interest was in getting credit card applications. Seats were extremely tight in first noticeably less pitch than narrowbody flights on United or American. No entertainment no power outlets. The food was tragic on the outbound edible on the return but served without linens and with a paper napkin. No milk for coffee on domestic flights. Although I had a revenue first class ticket for $1700 US Airways still wanted me to pay extra for better seats on each flight(!) The Charlotte hub was a mess signs were broken moving sidewalks inoperable and my gates changed on the spur of the moment in each direction. Bags took close to 45 minutes to be unloaded in Seattle about 20 minutes in Hilton Head.,1united-airlines,31/03/14,London Heathrow to Newark to connect to Fort Lauderdale Florida. My trip to Newark was uneventful. It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight. As I am writing this my baggage has still not been delivered.,3united-airlines,31/03/14,Narita Tokyo to Singapore Changi on March 28th. IFE did not work (and even if it did I would be stuck with according to what was in in-flight mag an old and poor quality selection) food awful and had to pay for wine on a transcontinental flight (a first for me). Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones. Even the announcements were the worst I have come across. Purser who did not seem to be able to speak English and a captain who had obviously not been sent on any course about speaking to the public (lacklustre disjointed and very rare). Won't be booking anything with UA again.,3us-airways,11/08/13,We had flown with SAS to Amsterdam and US Airways should take us to Philadelphia and then Seattle. On our returning trip back we started at LA with stops in Philadelphia and Frankfurt. On our trip to Seattle our flight from Philadelphia to Seattle was cancelled due to mechanical issues so we had to wait a couple of hours and take a connecting flight through San Francisco. My baggage had somehow been lost in Philadelphia - so did not receive it until the day after I arrived. The same thing happened on my way back I was obligated to hand over my hand baggage when boarding. I have flown many different companies through the years but this is the worst experience. The inflight service was okay - but bagage handling was apparently non existent.,us-airways,08/08/13,Been in Charlotte NC for 8 hours of delays been put on different flights only to be turned away with plane still sitting there by there rude gate employees with no manners and no customer service.,united-airlines,31/03/14,Feb 2 from Newark to Punta Cana flight UA 1520 returned Feb 9 flight UA 1518. Traveled from Newark on March 21 flight UA 423 to Fort Myers. Returned on March 24 flight 1587. What a disappointment! It started at check-in at Newark airport they expect you to do everything and if you ask for help they make it seem they are doing you a huge favor. The seats are super tight have to pay for luggage food TV I'm surprised they don't charge to let you use the bathrooms! They make you feel like you are getting on a bus.,1united-airlines,28/03/14,LAX-SFO-SEA-LAX in United First. Outbound legs to Seattle were great. Service was warm and personalized even if only snack basket and drinks were offered on these short runs. Where United really shined was on the return flight. Original SEA-LAX flight was canceled due to mechanical on inbound aircraft. I received a text message with this update and before I could even get to the agent UA had me rebooked on another carrier getting in just 30 minutes after my original UA routing. When I got up to the agent she had my ticket ready and waiting for me. I fly United almost every week and seldom have cancellations or major delays. Regardless the way they handled this one was flawless and I couldn't have asked for better service all-around.,10us-airways,05/08/13,"US Airways itself was not too bad. The problem was the smaller airlines they contract to. Boston to DC (Reagan) - not too bad was on time at least. DC to Chicago - delayed but no idea why. Sat in Chicago for 2 hours boarded deplaned boarded again - they ""couldn't find the pilot"". Finally got to Des Moines. Two days later Des Moines to Charlotte - delayed no idea why. While waiting for my carry-on to be retrieved from ""valet checking"" so I could make my connection to Philadelphia the gate attendant was quite rude when I asked the status of my connection. Ran through the airport to make the connection then sat on the plane for 30 minutes. Was also told that I would need to check my carry-on because there was ""no room"" in the overhead compartment. When I boarded most of the overhead compartments were open - several were empty most were less than half full. Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it. Philadelphia to Boston was slightly delayed because of a check engine light that came on after we were all boarded. They did manage to get maintenance in fairly quickly and apparently got the problem resolved - but this was US Air not a smaller airline. I'm going back to Southwest and Jet Blue - cheaper more reliable more customer oriented and they keep better track of their pilots.",3us-airways,01/08/13,FRA-PHL-SFO. Total mess - 2 of 4 FRA-originating flights delayed due to weather apparently. My FRA-PHL flight delayed 2 hours missing the PHL-SFO connection. About 100 people in line to the ticket desk in FRA because the FRA-CLT flight was delayed 7 hours. Called US Airways and was rebooked within 5 minutes. Excellent customer service. US Airways flights depart from by far the worst part of FRA airport (and one of the worst areas of any airport anywhere). No food no shops nothing - gate was changed unannounced then everyone was asked to leave the gate area to be re-checked. As I said complete mess by both airport and airline staff. In the end flight arrived PHL 2 hours late as expected. PHL-SFO flight also delayed without reason or apology by 2 hours meaning arrival to SFO at a cringeworthy 1.30am. Bag thankfully redirected and I have to admit service by flight attendants great throughout and good iFE on the FRA-PHL flight.,4united-airlines,28/03/14,"4 Sectors with United YVR-ORD ORD-BOS BOS IAH IAH-YVR. Very poor customer service on the ground and in the air. Greeted at the aircraft door by the usual icy scowl. A ""good morning"" from me totally ignored on all sectors. Officious cabin crew. A request for two drinks met by a terse response of ""We do more than one drink service this is United!"" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don't believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days. I can tolerate the ancillary charges the cramped seating the lack of food I understand that's what most of the budget conscience travelers demand these days. But simple manners courtesy and mutual respect cost nothing to provide and sadly they seem to be the most difficult qualities to find in any US airline.",1united-airlines,28/03/14,If there is any alternative to flying United take it. The staff do their best but everything about the interface is far from traveler-friendly. First of all the food - and this is in first class - can only be somebody's idea of comedy. Murky chalky flavors and strange un-natural textures characterized every dish I was given. Also on one recent Newark - Los Angeles flight there was were no screens in the plane - no movies no TV. No wireless available and no plugs.,2us-airways,01/08/13,Flew PHL-CDG and CDG-CLT in Economy. US Air was the low cost carrier for this route and it showed. Food was fundamentally inedible but I was grateful to have brought my own. Crews were mostly friendly and helpful. Flight seemed to be a non-stop sales pitch to buy duty free upgraded snacks etc. I thought several times that this unnecessarily disturbed what could have been a serene flight. Had the new Airbus planes both ways. Someone had broken off the tip of their headphones in the receptacle and the poor FA could not remove it even after returning with tweezers. Thus I could not use the AVOD for the entire eight hour flight. US Air got me there mostly on time but this was not a very enjoyable or peaceful experience.,5us-airways,01/08/13,Have mixed feelings about the airline. I think they have decent flight service. I took the Dublin - PHL route and was surprised by the cheerful service aboard. Food was good and there was free wine (United needs to learn about this). My domestic connection got delayed and the personnel were not very helpful with the situation (I tried to get in an earlier flight and they did not help with it). I ended up flying that segment with Jet Blue and complain later. The customer service representative received the feedback and took actions about it. I would still recommend them particularly for international flights.,8united-airlines,27/03/14,Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.,1united-airlines,27/03/14,The worst experience I have encountered when flying. Total disregard to their customers and employees. The poor people at the gate were just beat up to no end and it was not their fault. Flew out of Aspen Colorado which only has 6 gates and 2-3 planes to manage and they could not even accomplish this simple management. United changed my flight without even giving me the courtesy of an e-mail or phone call to check to see if this arrangement was ok. It wasn't even a change in a flight on the same day but they changed the day I was flying out changed from one layover to two layovers changed the total flight time and did not even offer an apology for this inconvenience. In the future the only way I will ever fly United again is if there was no other airline going to this location. A horrible experience.,1united-airlines,27/03/14,I am on a flight to LAX from SFO already delayed by 45 mins waiting for flight crew to arrive. This had already given me a pretty good idea of customer service the flight's staff has to offer but that got solidified when I asked for 2 cups of water from one flight attendant and she told me - 'why don't you finish one first?'. She eventually got me another cup.,2us-airways,01/08/13,CLT-FRA-CLT. I love flying US Airways direct (hate PHL). Good service - the newer A330's are a great improvement. Good service and value.,7us-airways,31/07/13,Kona-ABQ via Phoenix in first class. US Airways first class is worse than some coach seats I have been in. The seat in front of me was rubbing against my legs (I would expect this in coach but in first?). One drink run before take off and not another one for 4 hours. The meal was edible but very small and disappointing. On the second flight the crew was nicer but than again they are not US airways because the flight was operated by skywest. I had a 3 hour layover in Phoenix and even though I had paid for first class I was only allowed into the lounge if I gave them more money.,3united-airlines,26/03/14,First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.,3united-airlines,25/03/14,UA 861 from Washington to Rio de Janeiro scheduled to depart at 9.30pm. The flight was delayed first and then after making me wait for 5 hours the flight was finally cancelled due to mechanical problems at 3am. I got re- booked on the flight for the next day at the same time was given a night at hotel and $14 voucher for the meal for the whole day. The next day I found out that my connection to Sao Paulo to Rio no longer existed so was booked on a later flight with a regional airline. Basically what should've taken me 14 hours took me 48 hours. Furthermore my luggage arrived 2 days afterwards after several phone calls and different answers from United agents. The food served on the plane was inedible. Worst air travel experience. The seat was so crammed for a 9+ hour flight I had to buy premium economy on my way back so that my knees won't hurt.,1united-airlines,24/03/14,Absolutely the worst flight. Both trips were delayed for aircraft mechanical issues. 3 hrs on the way there 4 hrs on the way back. I've never really liked United but we still fly because we were avid Continental flyers for years. I will make it a personal goal to avoid United as an airline for any future flights I have. The price was ridiculous and the service and crew were mediocre at best. I thought United had newer aircraft fleet. Then why are two flights delayed because of mechanical issues? I would never recommend flying United.,1us-airways,30/07/13,"SFO-PHL-FRA trying US Airways for the first time after being rebooked ""from"" them onto other airlines due to delays. Surprised with how decent they are. Both flights had roomy (though not very comfortable) seats excellent service on-board and arrived on time/early. Acceptable food on the PHL-FRA and even free wine - not that it's any good. IFE system is excellent on the A330s. Would fly again.",8us-airways,24/07/13,Very frustrating experience with US Air when flying to Glasgow last week. Our traveling parties were meeting in PHL to connect to the same transatlantic flight. Both flights delayed due to weather but they go in to PHL at around the same time. Our flight then sat out on the tarmac for 1.5 hrs because they didn't have a gate for us. While we were stuck out there the captain kept saying all flights out were grounded so we would make our connections but that wasn't true as mine left leaving me stranded. Next flight waited for passengers to come in from a delayed flight. Why couldn't they do that for me? I finally made it to Glasgow the next day via London but missed the first day of vacation. On the way back our flight was delayed 2 hours due to maintenance and the next one was as well. On top of all this the staff were rude pushy and the flight attendants were surly the meals were gross and the TV sound did not work throughout so that was 7 hours with nothing to watch. They also kept running out of drinks and food by the time they reached our seats. If I can help it I will never fly US Air again!,united-airlines,24/03/14,Milwaukee to Los Angeles March 16 2014 returned March 19 2014. Flight 5165. Flight 1273 missed this flight due to the above one being late next flight UA729. Return flight 1498 delayed and missed connecting flight 5438 rebooked to flight UA5425. Late flights and rude service. My flight leaving was late and missed connecting flight. On the return home my flight leaving and connecting flights were late. Flight attendant stands in aisle talking while we try to get off plane to make connecting flights. Captain had asked everyone to be seated unless you have a connecting flight.,1united-airlines,24/03/14,"I booked a return trip to Las Vegas via Dublin. On the return trip the seat in front of me was an emergency exit. The seat itself appeared to be broken when the passenger in this seat put the seat in the rest position the seat reclined back so far that the space left to me was extremely confined. When I asked the cabin crew if I was obliged to have this person sitting ""on top"" of me she stated he was allowed to put his seat back. As a result I sat for 6 hours approx with no reasonable space in front of me. I got no food as there was no room to let down my food tray.",1us-airways,24/07/13,Left LAX on Saturday to take my daughter to Providence. Flight delayed and we missed out connecting flight to providence was stranded in Philadelphia. They did not offer any help and just gave us new tickets to come back to airport next day. Sunday morning went to airport realizing that they had booked my 16 daughter on a different flight to DC! Ended up renting a car and driving. Went back to airport on Monday 7/22 to catch my flight to LAX. Flight from Providence was late again and I missed my connection again. Was re-routed to Phoenix and stayed on the plane for 3 hours for bad weather and missed the connection from Phoenix to LA. Stranded in Phoenix again and finally made it to Orange county airport on Tuesday.,us-airways,21/07/13,"Choice Seats aren't choice at all. We flew a 6pm to midnight flight from Philadelphia to Glasgow on 17 July 2013. We paid $99.00 each for ""Choice"" seats 24A and 24B. These were considered choice seats by the airline because they are Emergency Exit seats with the extra leg room. Unfortunately they are directly behind the lavatories. The cabin lights were dimmed we took out our blankets and pillows closed our eyes and someone opened the lavatory door flooding our seating area with glaring florescent light. Our plans for catching a nap were ruined.",3united-airlines,22/03/14,Both coming from and going to our destination the check in staff were very rude and difficult to work with. We've always been around 50 pounds for our checked bags sometimes a little over sometimes less and most airlines don't care as long as you're close enough. Not United - it's 50 lbs exactly or they won't take your bags. Their check in staff are normally pretty unhappy and rude. What makes it even more ridiculous is most people just shift the weight to their carry-ons - meaning the airplane is still carrying the exact same amount of weight.,1united-airlines,19/03/14,I recently flew from SFO to Cancun and back. First off I had to pay for poor entertainment offered inflight when other airlines offer better entertainment for free. I mean I paid for movies that I can't even pause when I use the restroom (ridiculous). Secondly no food was served for this long flight. Even some chips or light snacks would have helped. Thirdly the seats were meh I have had better seats. It is a forgettable experience except for the bad parts like the entertainment system. If given the chance I will not fly United again.,3us-airways,21/07/13,"Flew London to Philadelphia then on to Greensboro NC and return. Outbound the first leg was excellent. The connecting flight to PTI was delayed as there was no fuel in the aircraft then an engine failed on start up. The Captain kept us informed as the engineers tried to fix it and an hour later we boarded a replacement airframe. On the return there was an hour delay at Philadelphia due to the aircraft being ""too hot in the cabin"" as it had been sat in the sun all day but the staff kept us informed of progress. What I did appreciate was that the bags went straight through and were ready to collect straight away. There is always room for improvement but I think these guys should focus a bit more on the maintenance - get the aircraft ready earlier and make sure it is serviceable before the flight - not wait until everyone is at the gate waiting to board.",8us-airways,19/07/13,DFW to Phoenix 6/30/13. Then from Phoenix to San Diego because of fog problems the plane could not land so they re-routed us to Phoenix. During this time I had a connection flight leaving San Diego and my husband and I missed our connection flight leaving San Diego to Hawaii. I went to the Phoenix counter to just get a brush off and were told that another flight was leaving San Diego to Hawaii that day. By the time we arrived in San Diego that morning we had been left stranded. I will never take a flight to San Diego nor will I fly US Airways. They offered to fly us out 2 days later. I had to purchase a whole new ticket that night to get us to our destination.,united-airlines,19/03/14,UA838 BKK-NRT Biz class. Flight was packed. Wonder why UA would discontinue BKK with the planed loaded with passengers. Laid flat seat. Sat on the upper deck near the cockpit. UA Biz were pretty crowded. Food was mediocre. Breakfast choices were Thai noodle or omelette. Grilled sandwich prior to landing was delicious.,5united-airlines,19/03/14,UA79 EWR-NRT Biz-First. This is a long haul flight about 14 hours on a Boeing Dreamliner with staggered seats. Would have been nice for privacy but unfortunately seated next to a guy who had cold and sneezed around most of the time. Mid flight snack placed in the galley was minimum. When I went there most were gone. Toilet was poorly stocked with only 1 liquid soap bottle. Flight crews were nice. Amenity kit came in a lousy tin can but it is said to be a collectible one.,4us-airways,17/07/13,"Every time I book a flight I promise myself that I will not use US Airways again. Unfortunately they are the only airline that fly into Hilton Head Island so we are captive to them. Once again they have cancelled our flight from the island into Charlotte and we will not make our flight to Phoenix. The explanation given was ""weather"" in Charlotte. Doppler radar says 30% chance of rain in Charlotte during the time we would have been there. The only thing I hate worse than a cancelled flight is a blatant lie about the reason the flight was cancelled. No compensation given at all. Can't get out until tomorrow.",us-airways,17/07/13,Dublin to Charlotte (5th July 13) Charlotte to Dublin (12th July 13). Disappointment at both flights but especially Dublin to Charlotte: 1) ran out of earphones so no entertainment for 8 hours. 2) one of the toilets out of order for full flight. 3) another toilet ran out of toilet paper. 4) hot breakfast ice cold. Return flight - my wife asked if we could upgrade but were told flight full. Expected to depart at 6.20pm but did not board until approx 7pm despite on-time advised. Made to sit on plane while we waited for passengers from another flight who had missed their flight to Paris - eventual departure 8pm. Some of these were put in first class although we had been told flight full with no upgrades!,united-airlines,19/03/14,UA29 14/03/14. Friday evening departure from Newark and the airport was busy however the check in and bag drop facility was well organised so wasn't queuing long. Onboard the flight the 777 was full so it did feel quite claustrophobic the seats were not very comfortable but the legroom was ample. The flight only took 6 hours 15 minutes but the cabin crew were friendly and worked really hard and managed the meal service and two drinks runs before turning the lights off. Breakfast was served an hour and half before landing and consisted of a warm croissant and a small fruit salad. The flight landed ahead of schedule in to Heathrow and I was again fairly impressed with United.,9united-airlines,19/03/14,UA 468 SFO-PHX First Class. UA 1265 PHX-EWR First class. Typical domestic UA first which is nothing more than a bigger seat and free food. Ordered SW Chicken salad but got tasty beef with noodle instead. First class fare is not reasonable. If purchased separately way too expensive for what you get.,4us-airways,14/07/13,Have always traveled using U.S. Airways usually from Charlotte NC to NYC. Last year entrusted them with our 16 year old traveling alone to Paris for a month. This year we traveled as a family to Paris and will be using them again in August as they now have a direct flight from Charlotte NC to Dublin Ireland. Have never had any trouble with this airline. Luckily no bad weather so flights have always been on time. My only complaint is on domestic flights they let people with huge carry-on luggage board and they fill up the available overhead spaced. I have had to check my regulation size carry on bag on a couple of occasions for lack of room. They don't seem to care what size your carry on bag is. Also food is awful but this is probably true of most airlines. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.,10us-airways,10/07/13,Two days trying to get from LGA to MEM through DC. Flight from DC to Memphis was delayed 2 hrs then they put us on the plane and after 2 hrs seated they cancelled the fight. Trying to get back to NY after 2 hours inside the plane they cancel again. They put me on another flight to NY which finally left after another additional 2 hrs delay. Next day: try to get to Memphis again LGA-CLT ok but the second flight CLT-MEM was 2 hrs delayed again. Staff unhelpful and rude. Will never use their service again.,united-airlines,19/03/14,UA838 NRT-SFO Biz class. This is a long haul flight with amenity bag. Japanese food selection was Okay. Mid flight snack was placed quietly in a galley. Good thing was the arrival lounge at the SFO to freshen up and shower after landing. This lounge closed at noon and quite difficult to locate. It is on a lower level on the way to terminal 3 if you walk from the international terminal. Info desk did not know about the UA arrival lounge.,5united-airlines,19/03/14,UA 837 NRT-BKK Biz. Sat on the upper deck to avoid the large Biz crowd. Flight was so packed. Hope UA consider to continue its operation to BKK again in the near future. Food was mediocre with beef steak. Japanese crews were polite and nice.,4us-airways,07/07/13,PHL-SDF and SDF-PHL. Flights were on time on both occasions. Comfortable flight and we had a pleasant crew member both ways. US Airways operates small aircraft on this sector so the interiors were cramped but overall good experience considering that this was one of the few direct flights between PHL and SDF and the flight duration's were just over an hour and half each.,8us-airways,04/07/13,EWR-PHL-FRA: Ground staff on EWR were friendly and made efforts to put me on an earlier flight as the original flight to PHL was delayed. PHL-FRA was a brand new Airbus 330 in fact only 4 weeks old so the aircraft itself was in order except the staff. Apart from one crew member all others were rude and any request from passengers seemed like bother. Apart from surly crew drinks were available for free except alcohol and food was just awful. On positive note the AVOD has good selection and soft drinks available in gallery. I would avoid US Airways because of the attitude of crew and bad food.,4united-airlines,18/03/14,March 12th 2014 flight UA200 was okay but we landed in Houston an hour late and were told our connecting flight UA5189 was cancelled. We were at Terminal B and at this point the service provided by United Airline Airport staff was very poor. Instead of providing us with a direct flight to Toronto we were put on 2 connecting flights these were delayed repeatedly until they were cancelled. We finally asked after waiting for 2 hours if there were any other flights to get home. We were put on an Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving at 2pm but told to go to terminal D to secure our seats and boarding passes but then were told to go to another Terminal and eventually found out this flight was leaving on March 13th a day later not 2pm on March 12th. Finally we went to counter 1 where a staff member helped fly us back to Toronto. We unfortunately had a 2nd overnight flight and although we left Honolulu on March 11th at 7pm we only landed into Toronto 6.45am Thur March 14th. The only saving grace was Air Canada offered free movies. We flew UA1715 and UA219 March 4 2014. Very long uncomfortable flight-no entertainment unless you paid. Very poor experience.,1united-airlines,18/03/14,UA28 9/3/14. Noticed online that aircraft had been changed from 777 to a 767-400 which wasn't an issue as the 400s have AVOD entertainment similar to 777 and are far superior in comfort than the older 767-300. The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more. I only purchased one alcoholic drink on this flight as united charge $7 for a beer which in my view is a bit steep for a long haul flight but typical of an American carrier. Having flown with united before I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed and most importantly I got from a to b at a reasonable price.,9us-airways,04/07/13,Flight from Charlottesville VA to Chicago cancelled due to mechanical issues. Put on a flight the next day and given the worst seats on the plane even though there were seats available for a $25 up charge. Given the run- around. Talked to 5 different people and everyone said someone else should be able to do it. Never again.,1us-airways,03/07/13,FRA-EWR: Outbound flight was old Boeing 737 instead of Airbus A330. Ground staff at FRA are friendly. Once boarded the flight was delayed 35 mins and information given by captain. It was all aged male crew. The crew were polite and friendly enough to cater most of the needs. The big change I experienced that drinks were unlimited compared to past where you had to buy drinks. Crew made about 3 to 4 rounds for drinks and later only seen during breakfast round. Being an old aircraft there were no personal TV but they played three different movies on those ceiling attached TV's. They also loaded my requested meal which was compared to none but trash. All in all experience could have been much better if they provide Airbus aircraft.,5us-airways,02/07/13,"Flight from Charlotte to Rome June 20. Rude crew no manners 6 staff frowned and looked like we were bothering them by simply being there. No hello no you're welcome just gruff minimal words. Not one crew member said 'thank you for flying with us"" etc as we disembarked. Just stood there watching all the passengers leave the plane. Return trip was July 1 2013 - service was just as bad. We went through Philly and had same negative and rude treatment on the ground. They cancelled our Philly - Hartford flight. We had to wait over 5 hours for our connection. One person only on the entire Rome - Philadelphia flight said thank you and was pleasant. On a positive note the crew from Philadelphia to Hartford were very nice.",1united-airlines,18/03/14,March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!,1united-airlines,17/03/14,YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it. I was Platinum with them last year and Gold this year but I'll stick with American or Air Canada.,1us-airways,01/07/13,Will never fly with US Airways again. Everyone boarded and was kept on flight for an hour due to maintenance problems. Temperature in Phoenix while stuck on the flight was over 100 degrees. We were kept waiting on the flight for an hour. Water was brought around but it was poured into cups. We were not given full bottles. Turns out there was an issue with a window. Flight was delayed an hour then a couple more hours. Currently flight is pushed back to 6 pm with an original 10.45am departure time.,us-airways,01/07/13,Wilmington NC to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Burlington Vermont. First flight delayed for 'maintenance' a couple of hours then finally canceled. Then booked on evening flight at 7.40pm. That flight canceled due to weather. Finally I took a flight the next morning at 6.40 arrived to my destination a day late. My return trip scheduled for 5.40 pm but there was a delay. Counter personnel could not give straight answers or decent advise. No other flights had to pay out for a hotel room that's not covered due to weather cancellation. Got an email confirmation on a 6.50am flight the next day I showed up to the counter and they did not have me on that flight. Now I'm booked on a 7.50 flight to Washington DC and a 1.50 flight home. I will make US Airways my last choice.,united-airlines,17/03/14,"UA5713 New York City NY - New York-LaGuardia (LGA) to Washington DC - Washington-Dulles (IAD) on 3/13/14. The new round of checks on size of carry on is being handled in a way that has convinced me that I should never fly United again. While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the ""got you"" attitude. I am convinced the lack of space in carry on bins will no longer be a problem because any business traveler or preferred customer will have enough sense to fly with another airline. It is amazing how far United will go to alienate it's good customers.",1united-airlines,17/03/14,Birmingham (BHX) to West Palm Beach (PBI) via Newark (EWR) Business Class. Outbound 25 Feb Inbound 10/11 Mar. Reading some of the reviews about United it would seem to be an airline to avoid however as it flies from my local airport I am more than happy to fly with them. The flights listed above all departed on time or within 10 minutes of schedule all arrived early allowing for hassle free connections. The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them. The entertainment system was not fully functional on the international legs. All in all the whole experience was a pleasant one I would recommend this airline for people in the West Midlands flying to the US albeit travelling in Business makes a difference but the premium economy and economy cabin looked to be ok as well.,10us-airways,01/07/13,6/16/13. Flew from San Francisco CA to Cancun MX via Phoenix. You have to check in your self they don't have a counter person to help you with check in at least not at San Francisco. I was traveling with my family total of 7 3 adults and 4 Kids it was not easy at all. US airways employee's were rude and not very helpful. If you want a snack you need to pay for it all they offered on a 5 hours flight was coffee and water. Will never use this airline again.,us-airways,30/06/13,LAX to Rome via Philly. The trip there went smoothly but there was weather coming home which delayed our flight. However we had a 3 hour lay over in Philly and arrived with 2 hours to make the connecting flight. When we presented our boarding passes we were told that our seats were cancelled as they didn't think we would make the flight. I was traveling with my elderly mother so I insisted that they get us on that flight. In the end they found seats for most of us but I had to sit separately from my mother and kids. To add insult to injury some people did not get on the flight although there were still empty seats. They cancelled our seats and put us all through turmoil for nothing. Our gate was also changed with no notice and at one point they had 3 flights waiting in one boarding area. No organization and I have flown with them for the last time.,3united-airlines,17/03/14,On return flight to Denver plane waits for 15 minutes at DIA as ground crew is on break and between shifts even though docking space is open and available for our plane. The one checked bag I had on a direct flight from Calgary did not make the plane even though I arrived for check in at Calgary in plenty of time. As this was a small United plane it was oversold. With so many carry ons checked in below I and multiple other passengers had their luggage shifted to another plane. After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes. When staff finally sashayed out the baggage reps stood for several minutes behind their computers talking to no one. The last 6 United flights in the past year that I and my family have taken have all resulted in some form of delays lost luggage or rude staff. I did not receive my luggage until 50 hours after my flight landed.,1united-airlines,17/03/14,Flew SLC to ORD then ORD to DCA both flights were great. The crew on both were very friendly and professional. We arrived early on both flights. I was in economy plus so plenty of leg room. Direct tv was available on ORD to DCA leg. I have flown a few of the discount airlines lately and was reminded how nice it is to fly United. Great trip!,10us-airways,26/06/13,Every flight I had scheduled had a major problem. Flight from Harrisburg to Philadelphia was immediately declared as 1 hour delay. While waiting we were told that we would be on time and they boarded us after several passengers had already been deferred to other flights. We sat on the plane for 25 minutes. Pilot notified that we would be leaving. Pilot then asked all of us to leave the plane again. We left the plane and returned to waiting area. While waiting for information regarding our flight to Philadelphia I was called to redirect my flight from Harrisburg to Charlotte NC to Sacramento. I would be arriving 2 hours later than my original schedule. (Previously 8.45 now 10.45). We finally arrived in Sacramento and when arriving at gate the pilot found another US Airline in our arrival gate. We sat for 20 minutes. We sat for at least 20 minutes waiting for availability of a gate for our plane to arrive. I got home at midnight originally would have arrived by 9.45. I was called to desk and transferred to a flight to Charlotte NC. I was to arrive at my original destination Sacramento over 2 hours later than my original flights.,us-airways,24/06/13,Cleveland to Fort Walton Beach via Charlotte. Both flights delayed. Once we boarded the second flight we sat on the runway for 45 minutes while mechanics changed a tyre. Coming back I flew Pensacola to Cleveland via Charlotte. Actually got in early to Charlotte around 5pm but found out that another US Airways plane took our gate so sat on the runway for 40 minutes. Connecting flight to Cleveland departed at 5.50. Needing to get off the plane I asked the flight attendant how much longer because I was going to miss my flight. She said they have no control over missed flights. Very rude and not accommodating at all! Once I finally got off the plane at 5.40pm I ran though the airport to make my flight to Cleveland. With 20 seconds to spare we made it. But I will never be flying US Airways again!,us-airways,24/06/13,Flew First Class from PHX to EWR round trip. Outgoing flight weather delayed 3 hrs (not their fault). Food inedible and served cold. Unbelievable for First Class. No entertainment no headphones etc. Not a quiet flight either since the 2 attendants sitting nearby in the jump seats were chattering for the entire flight when not serving. Return flight food slightly edible similar to coach several years ago. Gate agent failed to flag luggage as First Class so it was delivered last. Very bad experience especially coming off a First Class flight on Hawaiian Air which was very pleasant.,united-airlines,17/03/14,Travelled to Mexico with a family of 5. United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse. I have flown United before without issue and were extremely disappointed with the airline on this trip. I will not be flying United next vacation that is for sure.,3united-airlines,17/03/14,Flew VIE-FRA-IAD on 5 Jan 14 all economy. First leg was on LH1237 on a A321 second leg UA933 on a B777. Was prepared for a steerage experience on UA but felt the economy seat was surprisingly comfortable and the dinner ok as well. However there was a charge for wine/beer on this international flight of 9 hrs. I contrast this with the LH flight from VIE: complimentary sandwich and complementary wine/beer on a 90 min. flight! Try getting that on a US domestic flight!,8us-airways,21/06/13,St. Louis to Orlando via Charlotte. First flight left late and they made no effort to hold our connecting flight (on the same carrier). Provided no information on gate changes and we missed our meetings. Got up at 3am only to end cooling our heels in Charlotte all day. Will never book with them again.,us-airways,19/06/13,"London-Charlotte connecting Charlotte-San Francisco. As others have said Envoy service LHR-Charlotte was fine. Bad things happened once we arrived in Charlotte. Plane sat on tarmac for 30 minutes in queue. Then a large storm arrived as plane had not departed on time we were caught in the storm. Sat on tarmac for nearly 2 hours. Pilot told us every 15 minutes that ""Plane returning to gate for hail inspection"". Once parked at gate after 2 hrs pilot told us: ""Leave plane if you want just take boarding pass"". We followed this advice. After 15 minutes in terminal called airline to ask if we could rebook given uncertainty and they said BTW the flight is cancelled. Gate staff would not let us back on plane to collect carry-on's. We re-booked on another flight. We were told it would depart from Gate 15 then Gate 8 then Gate 15 then back to Gate 8. Flight finally left 2 hours late. None of our bags arrived even though airline had 2 hours to transfer to new flight and we were assured this would occur. Waited in long line at 1am to file lost baggage report. Our last flight with this airline. Food on domestic legs inedible no inflight entertainment.",1us-airways,19/06/13,It started badly when we arrived at the airport to discover that US Airways had separated my husband and me from each other - for an international flight. The ticket agent was rude and inflexible. It culminated on the return trip where we were again separated. The TV/video system does not respond to touch and in order to make something happen you practically have to pound on the screen - obviously affecting the person sitting in the seat in front of you. The restrooms were filthy. Our flight was canceled from PHL to IND because of weather and the agents rescheduling us were rude. We were re-scheduled for a flight 12 hours later which turned out to be the best scenario for our group (43 of us). Most of us had luggage that did not make it until the next day. I truly do not know how US Airways continues to operate with customer service being so poor.,1united-airlines,14/03/14,"I flew to Nashville via a connection in Houston. The first flight a 60 seater was overbooked by 7! The gate agent was totally overwhelmed. When I said I might ""volunteer"" to give up my seat she asked what the code for Nashville is. Agent came on and off the plane a dozen times before we finally left 15 minutes late. Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure. Aircraft taxied for 15 minutes then sat on the runway for 20 minutes. Not one word from the cockpit. Upon arrival in Houston we sat for 10 minutes until someone showed up to pull up the boarding bridge.",2united-airlines,13/03/14,We had a connecting flight from Chicago to Montreal at 7.30pm and boarding time was at 7.00pm. Got to the airport 2 hours before our flight and decided to get a bite to eat in the terminal but first we checked the screens and our flight was on time. Left the restaurant 30 mins before boarding when we go to the flight screens we had seen that it said cancelled we did not understand why? Told that the crew had not shown up and that there were no other flights available meaning we were stuck in Chicago until the next morning. 5am wake up to catch the new flight they had scheduled us on. Got to the agent at our gate and saw the agents panicking told it would take 30 minutes to get the problem sorted. To top it off my father booked a first class seat the plane did not have a first class so he asked for an exit row seat however they wanted to charge him almost 40$ when he had already had a first class seat to begin with.,1us-airways,19/06/13,If you are disabled don't fly US Airways. I made the mistake of booking a non direct flight instead of a non-stop flight. Flight delayed over an hour in Philadelphia. I sat on the plane for an hour unable to leave to get some food as the transporter had already left. The flight attendant did offer me some water apple juice chips and salsa free of charge. Flight left Boston at 11.30 and did not leave Philadelphia until 3 or later. When we finally arrived in Atlanta after 5.â€ù Unfortunately the wheelchair service was terrible. Very disappointed!,us-airways,19/06/13,Flew in from Frankfurt connecting in Philadelphia had a first class ticket with my husband went to the lounge problems getting in then waited 4 plus hours for flight to San Diego. Went to the gate and there seemed to be a problem they announced that they were having personnel issues waiting for a crew member to arrive - this was at 8pm (flight to leave at 8.25pm). Flight then cancelled and we were told to get a hotel and rescheduled the flight next day at 6pm no first class and had to pay $250 out of pocket to stay overnight. Next flight awful flight attendants rude sour. Will never fly US air again!,united-airlines,12/03/14,"Booked a flight in December 2013 for a trip to Palm Springs in March 2014 - at that time had seat assignment - little did I know that booking in advance does not guarantee you a seat on the flight - they over booked the flight and I was bumped off my 7 am flight and spent 15 hours in San Fran airport compliments of United Airlines. Waited all day to get on a standby flight (7 that went through that day all over booked) - would have been bumped from the 11 pm flight they rescheduled me on (after bumping me in the am) had I not checked to make sure I was ""guaranteed"" on the flight. Make sure that when you check in your ticket has a seat assignment - if it says ""see agent"" make sure you go early and hopefully get it taken care off - What a terrible disregard for peoples time from United. Feel bad for the ticket agents who I watched all day get yelled at by others who were bumped unwillingly!",1united-airlines,12/03/14,Possibly the worst airline to fly internationally. Such a shame compared to other European and Asian airlines. Traveled on the ORD-MUN. Flight was delayed due to leakage in cargo. Apparently they found it after every one boarded the plane. Planes are ageing. Entertainment system kept rebooting automatically. Each reboot taking 5 minutes. Service was pathetic. FA's never tried to help. Beverage rounds were few and in between. Overall has been a very bad experience whenever I have flown United. Avoid it like plague.,1us-airways,13/06/13,Kansas City to Seattle with a stop in Phoenix. On the day of my flight I got ready went to the airport and was helped by a lovely woman at the check in counter had no problems checking in my 2 bags and then went to wait for the plane. It was on time and ready to go had no issues with my carry on luggage and had a pleasant flight to Phoenix the staff member doing the intercom system was even showing us interesting things that were outside the window. Plane in Phoenix was on time as well the staff onboard were courteous and fun. My bags arrived to Seattle.,10us-airways,13/06/13,Flight ZRH-PHL on a 767. As noted in other comments those planes are very old with no individual in-flight entertainment modules in Economy class. The overhead monitors are just a few so unless you are seated close to them you need to have very good eyes to see what's going on selection of movies was pathetic. I am 6'3' but the seats were actually rather comfortable and roomy albeit worn out. Only complimentary alcohol is wine (from a carton?). Crew was polite although certain members did have a bit of an attitude. Overall US Airways will get you to your destination (often cheaply) which is what matters for most passengers.,7united-airlines,12/03/14,I am forced to fly by United Airlines from were I live because they are the only airline at my local airport. I haven't flown them on an international flight since the late 90's. It was a bad experience then my latest trip was even worse. If you're looking for bad seats bad meals people who hate their jobs then this is your airline. They charged me an extra fee of $100 (USD) for my extra check in bag. I had to pay high prices for any drinks with alcohol on an International flight. They flew us home (9 hour transpacific flight from Tokyo) with a fixed cabin TV screen. No power outlet for electronics and flight attendants that made you afraid to ask for a drink of water.,1united-airlines,11/03/14,I had the worst experience with this airline. I frequently fly between Hartford and Columbus. All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself. My morning flight the next day had a delay that cost be a full business day at work. This is just one of many times I have had trouble with this airline I will not be flying again.,3us-airways,11/06/13,I've just come back from a 2 week trip to the US from Ireland. I bought return flights to Boston with a connection through Philadelphia. On arrival in Philadelphia (which is a hub for US Airways seemingly) our connection was cancelled with no notice to passengers waiting at the gate. 20 mins after the flight was due to go the sign above the gate was still saying 'On Time'. We were told initially that all other flights were booked out that evening except for another 6 hours later which had no guarantee's of leaving. Eventually exhausted we agreed to layover for the night in a nearby hotel on US Airways expense. We flew the next days 18 hrs late. On our return flight via Philadelphia we were delayed on the runway 2 hours in Boston and arrived in Philadelphia 5 mins before our connection was to leave. They never held back the flight even though a substantial number of flights from Boston that evening had a large number of people travelling on that flight. Again we had to layover for the night. It was 24 hrs later before we flew out. Amongst all of this mayhem we came across the most rudest uncaring and incompetent Customer representatives I've come across. I will never fly with this airline again.,us-airways,11/06/13,Quebec City to Philadelphia. The plane was late so several customers had to be rescheduled. It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to check in 17 customers. The ticket agents were steadily working but it seemed the system for that airport was either antiquated or they had difficulty receiving/sending current information. Not sure if the fault was with poorly trained agents or a lousy system but the wait time was inexcusable. Then once we (finally) got on the plane we were delayed another 20 minutes while the baggage handlers arranged and rearranged the luggage in the storage area below the cabin. That extra 20 minutes caused us to miss our connecting flight. Not a good experience.,4united-airlines,11/03/14,Returning to Michigan from Waikiki we got to Chicago where we found out that the plane to Detroit was cancelled. When we went to the service desk they acted like they did not care told that we could be put on stand by until the next open flight in 3 days had a seat. Their customer service was rude and uncaring. Luckily our travel agent called American Airlines and got us a flight in one hour.,1united-airlines,10/03/14,Flew United SYD-SFO in Economy Plus. Paid $200 for exit row seat so unlimited legroom. Staff business like but not rude. Soft drinks offered soon after takeoff. Dinner was basic but that was actually welcome - steamed chicken 4 slightly shrivelled chips veg tiny Apple pie drinks offered again. Water was offered twice during overnight and a midnight ham roll and Tim Tam for those awake. Breakfast was omelette and barely recognisable sausage. IFE was shared screens but I used iPad. Overall not as unpleasant as I had feared.,5us-airways,10/06/13,Flight from Boston to Charlotte delayed for weather a lot of passengers had a tight connection time. The staff made no effort for suggesting passengers who need connection to deboard first in order to catch the next flight. Had to spend a whole night waiting for the flight the next morning.,2us-airways,09/06/13,Sky Harbor Phoenix to DFW this past Thursday. Flight crew were rude to passengers. We board the plane and taxi to the runway. After 20 minutes the pilot announces that due to electrical malfunctions we would be returning to the gate to allow maintenance onboard. This seemed understandable. Once we returned to the gate they opened the plane doors. After 15 minutes both pilots exited the plane. I took this opportunity to grab my cell phone to send a text message to my husband who would be picking me up. A flight attendant immediately turned and yelled at me and said that I was not allowed to have my cell phone on. I am a frequent business traveler and even have a flight scheduled for week after next. I am cancelling the flight perfectly willing to pay a cancellation fee and I will never fly this airline again.,united-airlines,10/03/14,Flight from Midland to Salt Lake City was great. Both planes were small but that was fine. The crew were great and the reason I purchased the tickets was because it was the fastest flight. The layover was short and it was easy to find my next gate. We left and arrived on time. On my way back however totally different! I had a 6.20 flight and arrived at the airport at 4.30. The line for United Airlines was so long it extended the length of the terminal and out of the door. I stood in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes! No information given and the line did not move very quickly at all. Finally at 6 am a woman working for United started walking down the line asking if anyone was going on the 6.20 flight to IAH. Over 30 people left the line to stand in yet another line for an additional 10 minutes. No explanation was offered no apologies given. We were rushed through first class passenger line of security and I boarded the plane at 6:15 am. The plane was half full because everyone was still waiting in line. Our flight left at 6.45 because we had to wait on all the other passengers. The pilot did his best to make up time in the air and I made in time to make my connecting flight. I still have no idea what happened in SLC it seemed to me like a lot of laziness and poor customer service.,3united-airlines,10/03/14,Flew Dublin - Newark - Washington Dulles on 6th March on a B757 and then a D8. The cross Atlantic flight was fine on time reasonable seat good choice of movies etc. but the food was very poor - potatoes hard as was the bread no choice - it was meat or meat. On the hop from Newark to Dulles I was surprised how noisy it was though I was close to the engines. United seem to call people forward now by group number as printed on there boarding pass as opposed to seat number blocks. Not sure it helps and fail to see the logic of filling from the front back - getting the people at the back in first means less blocked aisles.,7us-airways,06/06/13,Flew from JFK-CLT-LGA. First flight was good overall except baggage was very slow to be returned. Return flight flight attendants seemed a bit clueless and my tray table was broken (it was an older aircraft but still.) Not a bad airline but not my first choice in any scenario.,5us-airways,06/06/13,The flight from check in to the actual flight experience was good the seats where okay the crew were polite served drinks respond quickly to needs. Boarding was fast from Charlotte to Houston return flight was lovely and the crew were excellent. The inflght entertainment is rubbish so come with your ipad loaded with music or movies. 757-200 are old planes used for the Dublin-Charlotte route apart from that I will use them for the right price.,8us-airways,04/06/13,US Airways called me about 5 minutes before I was going to get to the airport for PHL-SDF flight. Told that my flight was canceled. They offered my wife and I tickets to Indianapolis but no connecting flight to Louisville. The next flight was 21.30 (9 hours after the original to SDF). Flight was 45 minutes late taking off. Gates changed 3 times without notice given to passengers and departure board was not updated.,2united-airlines,07/03/14,It has taken me in excess of an hour to resolve what should be a simple matter on the phone with their customer service flights are always late (which I understand is not always the airline's fault but most of my late flights result from insufficient crew which they can do something about). The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children! Not to mention that they ran out of food. I already had low expectations for them but I did not expect to bring my own food to first class. Avoid at all costs.,1united-airlines,07/03/14,NRT-BKK. Uneventful trip on a route about to be abandoned by United. Surprising considering the 747 was packed to the brim. Boarding was chaotic and those of us in business class had no idea where to line up to board. Nice hard product but uninspiring service and meal. Overworked flight attendant working business class in the dome got the job done though. Pilot had Channel 9 (air traffic control) activated which is one of the nice features that only United can claim. The RCC lounge at NRT has much to be desired - hands down had the worst cappuccino in my life there.,6us-airways,04/06/13,LHR-CLT-SRQ-CLT-LAS. Envoy class LHR-CLT on A330-300 very good. Full flight in both classes. Boarded on time but delayed takeoff due to congestion arrival CLT on time. Seats comfortable with a good view out of the windows in row A on a 1x2x1 configuration. Food very good and unusual for me ate all courses offered. Inflight snack bar available. Staff friendly and helpful. Charlotte airport excellent for USA arrival through immigration customs bags onto SRQ and in the lounge within 40 minutes. A lot better than LAX at 3 hours plus. CLT-Sarasota and back on US Express both on time and again good crew. Ground staff also very helpful. CLT-Las Vegas on an A321 again full flight no entertainment but food OK again. Only mentioned the credit cards on this flight but not too pushy. Priority bags delivered first on all flights. Overall a very good experience to counter all the negative ones.,9us-airways,03/06/13,MAN-PHL-LAS on 8th May and SFO-PHL-MAN on 26th May. Transatlantic legs in A330 much better than domestic segments by A320 within the USA. Food onboard in long haul fine served a glass of wine for free if requested which is an improvement. Breakfast tasty if only lacking in quantity. On 5 hour domestic flights only water and 1 non alcoholic drink served plus coffee/snack on outbound. Effectively operates a no frills model domestically even if you travel on a transatlantic ticket. They should issue free vouchers at least for people travelling long haul although no charge for checked bags on such ticket. AVOD installed on transatlantic temperamental but did work and headsets now free. Would not pay a premium to fly this carrier but as price paid for an open jaw return significantly lower than more premium carrier options was worth doing. All check in queues quite short made to use self service at SFO but system could not find our reservation and had to see agent anyway. Some staff are good at their jobs others going through the motions particularly on domestic leg. This is an average airline nothing special but if schedules and pricing acceptable would use again.,6united-airlines,07/03/14,"Flew from Newark to Denver where United decided without any form of communication to hold 2 of our bags to arrive with the next flight to Denver 3 hours later. After arriving in Denver we waited at the baggage carousel for nearly an hour until we were fully convinced 2 of our bags did not make the flight. Throughout the night we tried calling different customer service numbers of United and could not get a straightforward answer. 20 hours later our bags reached us. On our flight back from Denver to Newark the entire flight was boarded seat belts fastened welcomed by the pilot until another announcement from the pilot came on and I quote ""there is a small problem. Should be a quick fix that will take best case 30 minutes"". 10 minutes later we are told to deboard the plane because this ""quick fix problem"" has caused the plane to be completely out of service. As we all deboard our entire flight is told to go to one customer service desk with 4 representatives. Nearly an hour later we finally get up to the representatives and all I hear is a potential flight to Houston reboard the out-of-commission plane at 3.30 or wait until tomorrow. Save yourselves the trouble and aggravation and never fly United Airlines!",1united-airlines,06/03/14,LAX-JFK and return. Never flew United previously so after reading many reviews had lowered my expectations. I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away! Even a pre-boarding offer to check wheelie bags for free due to a full flight was met with disinterest. It really is one area needing tightening up.,8us-airways,28/05/13,US airways cancelled my first flight from Boston to Philadelphia (connecting in Philly to go to Richmond) while I was on my way to the airport. When they gave me my new flight the next day they did not put my brother and I next to each other when our seats were together on the original flight (seats next to each other were available on the flight). When we made it to Philadelphia the next day they cancelled our flight to Richmond and had to schedule again! Customer service were good at putting us on the new flight but flying this airline is a gamble.,1us-airways,28/05/13,Flew PHL to SJU return. US Airways use a 757 that was originally configured to fly the transatlantic routes on some of these services. The seats were proper old-style business class cradle type with great leg room and plenty of recline. Service excellent. Food good. No in-flight entertainment on either sector. Would definitely choose US Airways on this route if they continue using their 757s with the ex-long haul configuration. Both flights on-time.,9united-airlines,06/03/14,Traveling out of New Orleans Louis Armstrong airport for business around 2 pm on 3/5/14. Baggage check was totally disorganized. I was directed to a kiosk by one of the agents then waited 15 minutes after I had checked the bag electronically for someone to come and tag it. When an agent showed up to tag the bag they were clearly not in a hurry. Then my flight was delayed. Maybe there's no rush at check in because United flights are late so often.,2united-airlines,06/03/14,Washington to San Diego and San Francisco to Washington. Old planes not enough overhead storage for the amount of cabin luggage they allow people to lug in. One stewardess had a shouting discussion about the oncoming superbowl from the front of the plane to row 39. No free food on a 5 hour flight no drinks except water and fruit juices of doubtful quality. Online entertainment is a joke! Never again!,1us-airways,28/05/13,I had a miserable experience and customer service has been worthless. Our flight was delayed for over 4 hours due to auxiliary power failure. After 4 hours they took off even though nothing was fixed. Dealing with customer service is pointless - they don't know anything and just give you canned response. I will never fly them again.,us-airways,28/05/13,LHR-PHL and PHL-LHR. Absolutely no complaints. On-time. Excellent seat in envoy class. Friendly service and good food. Wines not as good as BA and no Champagne pre-take off or in-flight only sparkling Italian Prosecco. Lounge in PHL inferior to BA's but US Airways use the Star Alliance lounge at LHR which is good. Would use again if the price was right.,9united-airlines,06/03/14,Flew UAL 218 first class from HNL-ORD then connected to UAL express ORD-YWG. Service better than expected. 777-200 had recliner seats with no flatbeds for an 8 hour flight. No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show. Almost an expected delay on any airline these days.,7united-airlines,06/03/14,"LHR-IAH-GUA. Prebooked upgrade 3 wks before travel. Check in easy with assistance from staff. Flight left on time and arrived on time in Houston. Flight attendants were friendly and the food was pretty average. You pay for your own alcohol which I don't have a problem with but theirs is expensive. Entertainment selection ok. Prem econ seats offer nothing more than extra legroom about 4"" but was worth it on long haul. Nothing to complain about there and using Houston for transit we were impressed with the speedy immigration channels which took much of the hassle out of using the States. IAH-GUA also on time and again a typical short flight with nothing special but nothing to complain about.",6us-airways,26/05/13,2nd international flight with US Airways in F Cl (Envoy) 1st was PHL-TLV-PHL and 2nd was PHL-FRA-PHL. Found the service excellent. On time-comfortable and an extremely accommodating staff. Very pleased - will definitely fly them again. Inflight services excellent.,10us-airways,23/05/13,DEN-PHL-FCO and return. Not sure how they managed this but all flights departed late but arrived on time so no complaints there. Flew economy seats were comfortable enough although the rows are close together. cabin crew on all flights very pleasant; international crew did an especially nice job. International in-flight entertainment in economy is very nice. Would fly again.,8united-airlines,05/03/14,I used to like flying United but the last couple of trips have really make me think about other airlines. I had to fly to Honolulu in January to take care of my mom for 2 weeks. They canceled my departing flight. My flight from Houston was delayed 2 hours and there was no personal TV on the flight. Flying home it was the same. I had to return to Honolulu in Feb. The flight to and from had no personal TV. I am not a savy personal and do not have I- pads or any personal electronics (and there were many other people like me on the plane) so using Wi-Fi did us no good. Sitting on the plan for 8 hrs plus with no entertainment really did not go over well.,4us-airways,21/05/13,Flight 38 (LAX to CLT) this past week. My sister who was visiting from out of country had her flight delayed because of some issue with the cabin crew and almost missed her connecting flight. Her baggage was delivered on a later flight to our hotel which was the least they could do. Our customer service rep was very professional and helpful in assisting us. US Airways is a great way to fly on a budget but they need to fix issues like this or no amount of value can make it up.,5united-airlines,05/03/14,May 27 through June 10 2014. The customer service for this airline really needs to be greatly improved. I book my flights in advance so I can have what I want and schedule what I am doing when I get there. So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change. Now I have to change my plans so I can accommodate the airlines wishes. Next time I think I will book with another company that I have had no problems with.,1united-airlines,05/03/14,LAS-LAX-RNO. One way trip at the last moment due to family matters. Had enough miles in the bank to make this work. The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means. A smile on either end goes a long ways. I have done many short and long hauls with United over the years and only once did I have an issue. United has treated me well and has my business.,9us-airways,21/05/13,"Seat 24F Flight 1471. The seats in back are made for people who are less than 5"" tall and 120lbs. They install the seat so that your shoulder is up against the window panel which shoves you into the person next to you. You cant recline the seat and it is installed cockeyed so that your back knows you are tilted forward the whole ride long. I am glad it was only for an hour or so. People in front of me chimed in about sitting on top of one another. Paid for preferred access and watched the TSA line move like lightning while preferred access stood there like idiots paying for a service that is non existent. When you try to upgrade a seat to first class you loose the $ for the first upgrade. Fix that seat so it is flat and not tilting forward.",6us-airways,20/05/13,3/4 of my scheduled flights had serious issues. 4th flight I didn't take - my husband and I opted to take a rental car. First flight was taxiing to the runway we went back to the gate and changed flights. Replacement plane was fine. Connecting flight delayed due to a problem with the fuelling truck and then had an aborted take-off. We had to wait over an hour until they put us on a different plane at the opposite end of the airport. On the returning flight from Cancun we were notified mid-air over the Atlantic that there was some kind of electrical issue and that we had to make a cautionary landing in Miami. We were in Miami on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight attendants did not check on us. They didn't come by with water. We had to go get it from the back where they were filing cups. Finally we left again and were served 2 tiny cookies. We of course missed our connecting flight in Philly. They threw a voucher at us for a hotel 15 miles away. By that point everything in the airport was closed in regards to food and we had nothing to eat all day. We tried calling customer service only to be told repeatedly that they have no phone support for such issues.,united-airlines,05/03/14,I've been a United 1K member for 2 years 7 year Platinum member on Continental prior to the merger of the two airlines. I fly over 100k miles a year on business and used to enjoy flying however over the past 3 years United has been a nightmare to fly and do business with! Loyalty means nothing customer service is non-existent and upgrades uncommon. Schedules are terrible with multiple connections expensive tickets and they're flying more and more excruciatingly uncomfortable regional planes! Been flying a different airline starting this year since they offered elite status for flying a few thousand miles during a certain timeline so far so good!,1united-airlines,04/03/14,"Hong Kong to Newark on March 1. Flight crew was tired and cranky with bad attitudes across the board. One in- flight announcement was literally a snide ""buckle your seat belt it's bumpy"". Where other airlines turn a galley into a quasi-lounge area during such a long flight (15 hours) we were told there was to be no loitering around the galley or toilet areas. I will avoid this airline as much as possible in future. The only positives were the entertainment system and that the flight was on time.",2us-airways,20/05/13,"Recent experience on YYZ-PHL-CDG-PHL-YYZ was awful. Ignoring luggage issues on both in and outbound flights the ground service and scheduling were terrifying. Confirmed flights were cancelled or rescheduled without notice (email or text messages were received after the fact) gates were changed an average of 3x per flight all flights delayed (in some cases cancelled altogether) - my wife an I ended up on separate flights! - and departure information was inconsistent - i.e. big electronic display says flight gate F33 at 7.10pm little concourse display says gate F27 at 5.35pm and actual gate sign says 6.35pm and attendant says ""Oh the displays aren't updated very often"". The overall experience - coming and going - was flabbergasting. It's hard to understand how an organization can be so broken. I think what startled me the most is that the ground staff had so little regard for the degree in which they were trashing people's schedules vacations honeymoons etc. In fairness I'll say that the actual flight (once we got on one) was fine - nothing special but nothing horrible either - but getting to the flight transferring between flights luggage handling luggage problem handling responsiveness to client's was just plain horrible verging on criminal.",us-airways,20/05/13,I am long time US flyer with over 326000 miles earned on this airline I know the airline and its product and policies well and I must say I will do everything I can to never fly USAir (or American if the post-merger product is anything like USAir) again. Staff on long haul international flights (PHL-LHR) and (LHR-PHL) are not only rude and unprofessional they seem to have disdain for their customers. One does not expect personalized attention in Economy but even in this class of service this was still a $1400 ticket and quite frankly I expect better service for that kind of money. Multiple requests to have a personal wheelchair stored in the cabin coat closet (as every other international airline does) were ignored on not one but 3 separate occasions. Disabled passengers and mothers with infants were treated with complete disdain on both US Airways Flight 728 (5/17/13) and US Airways flight 729 (5/20/13). I fly frequently and am generally pretty tolerant of the hassles of flying nowadays however flying on US Airways between the US and Europe was truly the low point of my trip. The fact that both the outbound and the return flights were characterized by such poorly trained staff tells me this is an endemic problem. Their international product truly is garbage no matter what the fare is.,1united-airlines,03/03/14,My wife and a friend were flying to San Francisco last night and their flight was delayed from 8pm to 9.30pm. When they were finally on board they found that no meals of any kind were available on the 5 hour flight to the destination. My wife was only able to get two small glasses of water and a glass of tomato juice. If this is a sample of the way that United Airlines treats it's passengers these days we won't be booking any travel with them in the future.,1united-airlines,03/03/14,United cancelled our flight to Florida about 16 hours prior to our trip. You would think that with 16 hours to work with they could find a way to get a plane to the city I live in. Our travel agent had to scramble to make alternate arrangements with another airline. Now we are going to have to spend over twelve hours travelling and stop at one more airport. I am very angry with United's lack of compassion with our dilemma and diligence at arranging alternate flights to get us to our destination. I will never book with United Airlines again!,1us-airways,20/05/13,Was scheduled to fly from NY to Orlando for my first child's graduation. Flight from NY was rescheduled due to mechanical problem. Rescheduled to fly from NY to Philadelphia connecting to another flight from Philadelphia to Orlando arrived in Philadelphia while awaiting at the gate They closed the doors never asked me anything were very unpleasant to deal with and after complaining they finally rescheduled me for another flight that was late to Orlando which resulted in me being late for my Daughters graduation. When I spoke with someone on the phone all I got was a run-around and how sorry they truly are but there is nothing we can. Supervisor after supervisor nobody was willing to make the experience even a little pleasant.,us-airways,19/05/13,This is the first and last time I'll fly with US Air. The delays are ridiculous. I've never seen an airline with so many problems with their planes. Both flights I took to go stateside were delayed and both returning were also delayed. I missed my last connection. I have recently returned from another trip using Southwest. What a difference.,united-airlines,03/03/14,EWR to AUA round trip business class. The flights were the flights from hell. The crew was unpleasant. The plane was very old and should have been retired long ago. The food if you want to call it that was awful to say the least. I'm easy going and I couldn't find anything positive to say. Save your money and never go UA business class.,1united-airlines,03/03/14,Traveled to Denver from Rochester NY on United twice in the past month. Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane. Now I have to contact Customer Service as no one in the Service Center in the Denver Airport is authorized to do so. I am dreading the return flight home. I will be flying on other carriers from now on.,1us-airways,19/05/13,"When I did my online check-in it asked me if I wanted to upgrade to First Class for $300. I have travelled to East Asia (China) a couple times - first time I flew coach - 3 seats wide. After the 12 hour flight home I promised myself I would never do that again. The next time went to China on United I upgraded to Business Class - wow what a difference - lay flat seats are what traveling that distance was meant to be. I upgraded my wife and myself to first class for the 6 hour flight. US Air flies a old 757 to Honolulu but I will say for me the $300 was well worth it. The seats are the old school First Class seats big ""lazy boy"" style which recline maybe 10-degrees and no foot rest but very comfy and roomy. No duvets or pillows like business class to China but normal aircraft pillow and blanket sufficed for me. Hot meal service was fine - served on glass plates - two choices (chicken or ravioli) - airplane food - United business class to China had excellent food - this was more one step up from a TV dinner but sufficed. Ice cream for desert. After dinner had a nice nap and awoke to a basket of all kinds of snacks being passed out. Plenty of drinks readily available. So was it worth $300 each for wife and I to upgrade to first class? Yes but if upgrading means you are going to have to cutback on your spending once you get to Hawaii - definitely wouldn't recommend that. Hope upgrades are available for my flight home! Tip: if you can get seats in 2F and 2 D these are bulkhead and more leg room and the shared TV is on the wall in front of you.",7us-airways,16/05/13,The only reason we took US Airways was because they had a non-stop to Punta Cana from Philadelphia. They charge you $25 for your luggage and lost my daughter's. We came back 5/14/13 she just got it today 5/16/13. The seats were hard and there wasn't any entertainment. It has to be the cheapest airline going. They asked if anyone wanted bottle water I said yes they gave me a Dixie cup of water. When he served me my soda he spilt it on me and didn't even say he was sorry!,1united-airlines,03/03/14,"Just arrived at my hotel after a horrendous 24-hour trip from Montreal to Honolulu. The missed connection and re- routing through LAX was bad enough but I guess winter weather is a reality. What is not acceptable is this new DirecTV-United deal for in-flight ""entertainment"". Now in addition to having to pay extra for a poor sandwich wrap they've got the gall to make you cough up extra to watch a movie. I object to paying for what is standard on other airlines. They take your money $1000-2000 and then expect you to pay for a movie - or even a flight map. Of course they'll say it's only $6-8 for DirecTV and provides access to many TV channels as well.",1united-airlines,28/02/14,EWR-ZRH onboard 767-400. Rolled away from gate right on time landed in Zurich one hour early. 2-1-2 business class configuration great if traveling alone. Had center single seat which was comfortable and private. Classic movies on IFE was wonderful. Food was decent. Service was efficient but indifferent. Definitely no smiles.,10us-airways,14/05/13,Flew from San Juan to Philadelphia connecting to Los Angeles LAX. This airline deserves to go down to the ranks of Ryanair and one star less. The PHL Agents are the most bored staff in the USA and service onboard long haul Caribbean and transcon flights limited on one and only one beverage service and that's it. What do FA's the rest of the flight? Southwest just entered service into SJU from MCO/TPA/BWI and FLL and flights are extremely full. Will avoid US Airways at all costs even if the fare at another airline is higher.,us-airways,13/05/13,My recent domestic flight was so unpleasant. Late departures on all 4 legs of my trip. On last flight departing Philadelphia the gate staff were rude disorganized and apparently poorly trained. One member of the gate team showed a complete lack of compassion for a very young mother traveling alone with her infant. Body language displayed toward this young lady was deplorable. Seat was comfortable - looked to have been recently refurbished. Poor application of carry-on luggage policies travelers carrying over-sized bags and 3+ items were completely ignored. Seriously reconsidering my airline options for future travel.,2united-airlines,27/02/14,My wife and 22 month old son are about to board a 14 hour flight. United is only offering one meal service over that 14 hour period and they won't give any food to my son because he's on his mothers lap and doesn't have his own individual ticket. Some milk maybe some yoghurt a ham sandwich costs them what maybe $2? It's apparent that that extra $2 is worth more than the comfort of their lowly economy customers. Flying isn't what it used to be.,5united-airlines,27/02/14,"Terrible service unless you are some sort of elite status traveler. This airline wouldn't let me pick my seats during on-line check in. Assigned me and my 9 year old son Exit row seats because the flight was completely oversold. When I advised gate attendant that a 9 year old would be in the exit row they stated that I ""shouldn't have agreed to the terms and conditions of those seats"". Told to leave my boarding passes and they would fix it. After 40 minutes everyone else gets on plane I go up to find out what's going on and I'm then given back my original boarding passes and told to get on the plane and they would fix it there. Onboard told to see the 2nd attendant. The 2nd attendant tells me I can't sit in the exit row with a child. An attendant moved 2 people out of their seats into the exit row and then snidely says to me ""See. that wasn't so bad was it?"". I've taken 4 United round trips in the last 5 years and pretty much determined that this kind of attitude is common.",1us-airways,12/05/13,The worst flying experience with a lack of customer service to accompany it. I waited over 4 hours to take flight on one of their planes and over 2 hours on another that was eventually cancelled while we were aboard the plane. All of this happened during one international flight. I had connecting flights for what should have been 4 flights (2 there 2 back) every single plane was late. Nothing was offered. Overall just not my cup of tea. I will never fly that airline again!,us-airways,12/05/13,US Airways Philadelphia-Athens Economy Class. Just awful. But that was to be expected. US still flies ancient 767s on this route. Probably the worst transatlantic carrier around today. No entertainment system (they couldn't even get the shared TV right with movies being cut off half way and replaced with a new one) seats were old and visibly broken. I had planned to work on the flight when I discovered that my reading light was broken I was simply informed that I should have told the staff before we took off. Typical rude and unprofessional attitude that I have come to expect from the airline. No loss seeing them leave Star Alliance.,1united-airlines,27/02/14,LHR-ORD on 25 Feb. Flight departed on time and arrived 40 min early. 2 of 3 FA's good with prompt service. Third was trying but seemed befuddled at multi-tasking thus often a step or two behind. Nice touch that rather than leave the mid flight option at the galley they did a more formalized service. Food on primary meal was so-so for example my tilapia and shrimp had no tilapia. The per-arrival burrito was actually quite good. Seats were comfortable though a bit narrow and limited space to neighbor.,8us-airways,12/05/13,Last year I flew across the United States 28 times for work as well as flights to other parts of the US. I saw over 15 airports and flew in coach and first class (once my status got up to Gold I flew first class almost every week). I never had a cancelled flight or a missed connection and I was never more than 30 minutes late to my destination. Sometimes the flights were annoying but that was because of other passengers not the staff. My only complaint about US Air is that they don't have the extra legroom seats like United so you are forced to try to grab exit rows or pray for a bump to first class.,9united-airlines,26/02/14,"EWR (NJ) direct to POS (Trinidad). The United Club was unfortunate and so was the outdated 737-800 (UA1505) that took us to our Christmas vacation. Save your money folks and fly coach. This class of service is not worth the extra cost. I would say the worst part about flying United is the unenthusiastic and unhelpful service. No big surprise to anyone who flies United regularly. I also bought the Premier Accelerator and Reward Accelerator erroneously thinking that I would maintain my Status Match level with this flight. The ""fine print"" here is that the Accelerator is not permitted in achieving status if you're doing a Match but their web site will continually advertise it to you like it is. You will also be allowed to buy this product which I now have deep regret doing.",5united-airlines,25/02/14,"Our last series of flights (from the UK to the USA and also within the USA) were quite simply the worst travel experience we have had in over 30 years of being regular international and national travellers. Staff in the business class lounge were unhelpful badly informed and unfriendly. Flight was delayed and we were initially held sitting on board for several hours. Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall. Despite having a lot of baggage and having already been assured we could leave our checked baggage with United staff one member of staff told us ""we won't look after this anybody can take it and it's not our responsibility and then decided to insist we take our bags out immediately. The hotel United put us in was dreadful. Put on a fight the following day. We used air miles to upgrade to business class: United's configuration of the new extra-slim business class seats is awful. 2x4x2. Paying business class and being stuck in the middle with no dividers between two people you don't know? Hardly classy treatment! Seats are so thin that anyone with broad shoulders will be very uncomfortable. One of the internal flights in the USA was so cold that everyone sat shivering in their overcoats. At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them. United has also downgraded its Silver status so that now you only get one free bag not two. It is very sad to see the appalling way that United Airlines' service has plummeted.",1us-airways,08/05/13,MAD-PHL and return. Overall good. Both planes on time. First leg plenty of empty spaces so you can stretch. Main meal average but last minute pastrami sandwich quite tasty. Good selection of movies and music system a bit low at times. Nice crew. No lost baggage. Second leg full plane dinner ok breakfast a bit poor: muffin and coffee or juice. I didn't have to pay for the headphones. Toilets well maintained all flight long. I would fly with them again.,8united-airlines,25/02/14,FLL to EWR to SFO. UA1024 for the EWR leg firstly the pilot taxied too close to the corner and got stuck in snow. Solved that with a pull out and then the fun started. Pilot came on and said we are rerouted and he doesn't have enough fuel but that he is protesting with the tower. Over an hour later we are at a gate being fuelled. The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21. SFO has comfortable chairs but not to sleep on.,2united-airlines,25/02/14,I'm currently sitting at the gate for my United flight at LAX. A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was. The staff here looked at him like it was the most inconvenient question in the world. They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes. Definitely not impressed not to mention every time the gal came over the loud speaker she sounded like se had no clue what was going on. She kept getting flights confused and putting out wrong information. I will make sure I don't fly with them again.,2us-airways,07/05/13,I flew out of DTW to PHL at 9.30am but received an automated call at 9am stating that my connection from PHL to PIT was cancelled. Then on my way home I had a 2 hour layover in DCA. I noticed that every flight but 1 scheduled from 3.30pm to 6pm were delayed due to 'maintenance'. I'm still sitting at the airport an hour after my scheduled departure time with no updates on my flight status. Needless to say I should have driven home.,united-airlines,25/02/14,2 flights Feb 14 and Feb 17 LAX-SFO both last about 1 hour. Check in was a breeze though the process within LAX domestic wing can be a bit testy. Full flight on both ways with only drinks service given on economy. No entertainment system just some random loop of Olympic commercial. Flight attendants are organized and accommodating. Storage was a bit tricky and always a pain since all pax are not checking luggage so it gets full leg room is quite cramped even though I'm only 5'8''. Landing was good and was out the airport within 10 minutes. first leg was delayed 1 hour due to late turn around of the plane pilots were very informative throughout. Flights used ancient 737 and 757 on this leg so it can get stuffy. It wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular either just something that will get you from point a to b without much fuss.,8united-airlines,24/02/14,0 for 3! United Airlines failed to depart all of my flights this week on time by greater than an hour. Two of which were in excess of 2 hours. This resulted in my decision to cancel my last leg (which I was going to miss anyway) with them and drive 5 hours in the middle of the night to get to my destination. I didn't want to take the risk of staying overnight and not getting home. Apparently they don't have any concern for their customers and their timelines. Probably won't fly with them again.,1united-airlines,24/02/14,PSP-Houston-Washington-Ottawa. Arrived 1 hour and 45 mins prior to departure. In PSP they had 3 flights (Denver San Fran and Houston) all leaving within 30 mins. They had 3 attendants each flight left without people who were left in line because of the counter delays. Staff were less than helpful. No organization no communication. We got to the gate with 5 mins to spare. On the Houston - Washington segment they arrived with time left on the inflight movie - so no one saw the ending. I will not use United again.,3united-airlines,24/02/14,Really simple flight from Los Angeles CA to Newark NJ at 11.30pm then a connecting flight from Newark NJ to Boston MA (1.5 hrs buffer). Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left. Another associate came in talked to the associate at the counter and walked away. Flight arrives late and then I have to wait 7 hours for another flight to Boston. Total travel time ended up being over 17 hours. Horrible experience inept customer service.,1united-airlines,24/02/14,"Flew FRA-EWR and IAD-FRA last week and I have to confess: flying United is like blind tasting every-flavor beans. Their website and mobile app are an atrocity then again the flights were absolutely fine. The 15+ years old B777s with refurbished 3-3-3 cabins are way more spacious than many of the newer planes though 31"" seat pitch in coach feels borderline cramped. IFE screens are tiny but the AVOD selection is downright impressive. Unlike previous trips the staff were courteous attentive and efficient. Even the meals were rather delicious as far as airline food goes. There was plenty of drinks throughout the flight frequent updates from the crew and we even cut down a 40min delay to an on-time arrival to FRA - altogether an enjoyable travel experience.",8united-airlines,21/02/14,YWG-ORD-FLL-ORD-YWG. Check seemed more complicated than other carriers but did manage to figure it out. Left YWG on-time. Arrived into ORD more or less on time. Had 50 minutes to get to next gate which was miles away. Got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. 4/7 of my group members got seats. Three were put up in a hotel for the afternoon and the closest United could get them to FLL the same day was to fly to MEM. They arrived in MEM only having to drive 13 hours to get to FLL. They were fairly compensated that was the only good part of the outbound trip. On the way back check in was a breeze as it was deserted. Ended up getting to the gate with about 2 hours to spare. Plane was delayed about 25 minutes aggravating but didn't lose any sleep over it. Got into ORD a couple minutes late. My connection to YWG was supposed to be 40 minutes but our plane which was coming in from SAV was 4.5 hours late leaving thus delaying us 4.5 hours. I was insulted as we only received a $7 voucher. The only shop that was open was a McDonald's which was in the American Airlines terminal which was miles away. Winnipeggers don't have much choice in air travel but I will do my best to avoid United in the future.,3united-airlines,20/02/14,LAX-JFK EWR-LAX. Pros: two helpful ground agents and warm friendly lounge staff at LAX. Decent IFE and comfortable seat for the 5 hour flight. Cons: Too many to mention but mainly staff attitude about everything. Even the simplest task is completed with a sigh and a roll of the eyes. I've never experienced boarding a flight before while the crew talked amongst themselves and literally ignored passengers boarding - not even a request to show boarding passes. I've honestly never been tested with such consistent disdain by employees of a company to which I'm paying a considerable chunk of money. It got to the point where I just smiled to myself with amusement at their unprofessional and frankly useless and unhelpful manner. I only flew UA as a code share with AirNZ but can honestly say I will never ever waste my time or money again.,1united-airlines,20/02/14,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".",1united-airlines,20/02/14,"My sister wife and I travelled Heathrow to Chicago to Denver and onto Minot ND. Booked meals asked for veggie for me on the first flight. Lousy onboard service Chicago chaotic. Flight on small jet to Minot was excellent. return was via Washington. Lousy flight uncomfortable seats on United tight for me at 6'3"" on board attendants no patience. Food again on return was unplanned.",1united-airlines,18/02/14,"Planned a vacation to Australia and New Zealand over a year ago! Left EWR on Jan 22 for SFO flight was delayed almost 2 hours (waited about 40 mins to take off) most of the delay was caused by a mechanical problem. Pilot apologized for problem saw mechanic going back and forth down aisle. Had a connecting flight to Sydney with 1.5 hr layover. Notified flight attendant about connection and pilot contacted United to let them know that there were a number of people on the flight connecting to Sydney. Was told plane was taking off ""on time"" Got into SFO in enough time to make connection but sat on tarmac for 20 mins. waiting for gate. No gate agent no transportation - just run. Got to gate at 10.42 doors closed at 10.40. United's response - tough. One flight a day to Sydney. Customer service said EWR flight was delayed due to weather (untrue) therefore no compensation. Was upgraded to First class for following days flight. One hour before departure United takes away our first class tickets and gives seats to United employees (saw the badge) - unbelievable! Don't want to bore you with the return flights but suffice it to say had to spend two nights in SFO of course no compensation.",1united-airlines,18/02/14,I flew United on domestic US flights 3 times in last month and I am very disappointed by their customer care. They haven't informed passengers that due to delays their connection flight (on the same flight number as from Portland to Las Vegas through San Francisco) would be missed - they knew that before boarding the first plane. Secondly they ignored passengers who had to sleep at San Francisco airport on the floor having all restaurants and half of restrooms closed. When coming back from US to Poland (3 flights - 17 hours) I couldn't check an additional bag (as I should have Star Alliance Silver status) informing me that these were Lufthansa regulations and they have their own united and they don't care or I will have to pay 200$. I was forced to check the carry-on luggage as they found they had no free space onboard. Of course my hand luggage was an appropriate size. I am very disappointed and will do my best not to use United Airlines again.,1united-airlines,18/02/14,I was very pleased with the service I received on United during the recent bout of nasty weather. I left Charlotte going to Chicago and then onto Duluth MN. My Charlotte-Chicago flight was cancelled due to the weather and the agent here in Charlotte handled things quite professionally. The same held true in O'Hare when flying back to Charlotte. It was snowing pretty hard in Chicago and a number of flights were already cancelled. I asked to be rebooked on an earlier flight that was scheduled to go out. Again the agent handled things quite well. I wish all carriers had airport staff as professional as those at United.,10united-airlines,17/02/14,We just finished a trip to Belize from Edmonton Canada. This was our first time using a US airline. We flew with United and we were pleasantly surprised. Our only real issue was that the TV's were not available.,9united-airlines,17/02/14,Flight from HNL to Denver has been sitting at gate for 2 hrs and no information given other than cargo door problem. I quit flying United several years ago but booked this flight due to price. Never again. Will now miss my connecting flight to DSM. Will not make this mistake using this airline again. On flight over to HNL the entertainment system did not work.,1united-airlines,17/02/14,Worst airline I have ever been on. So far UAL has cancelled 3 flights from EWR to BOS with the excuses being weather crew and now mechanical. That's 3 separate planes. Seats in economy are tight with virtually no movement. I'll never fly them again.,1united-airlines,17/02/14,Arrived Tullamarine (Melbourne Australia) for long planned family holiday to USA. Informed flight cancelled and next flight was two days away! No apology no explanation. Flights through to LA and then to New York uneventful. Flight home from JFK - baggage issues plane delayed on tarmac for close to two hours no amenities from staff water etc. LA connection end then delayed by non appearing traveller. Flight to Sydney diverted to Brisbane due to low fuel missed connecting flights and luggage 'lost' (arrived 11pm four days later). United never again.,1united-airlines,17/02/14,GLA-EWR-MCO return. Transatlantic flights were pretty decent considering they were on a 757-200. The staff were friendly enough and the food both ways was fine either chicken beef or veggie option soft drinks free pay for alcohol. Flights in the US were OK with more legroom than the transatlantic flights and both were pretty much on time. Overall a decent enough product if you don't set your expectations too high and with United flying direct to the US from Glasgow I would use them again for the convenience of not flying via London or Amsterdam.,6united-airlines,15/02/14,YOW-ORD-HNL-LIH and return HNL-ORD-YOW. We were lucky to have a great inflight crew both ways. Perhaps the inflight crew was in a great mood going to Hawaii and as well maybe a very relaxed crew returning home. Goes to show you what a difference in a great attitude makes. The passengers were also very co-operative. We did leave Chicago 3 hours late. We had to finally switch planes. Good thing that the replacement plane had the same seat configuration which avoided a lot of chaos. Wish all my flights were as positive as this one.,8united-airlines,14/02/14,Worst airline and worst customer service anyone can ever imagine. 4 hour delay on the plane then cancellation next morning again 4 hour delay while sitting on the plane and then cancellation. 3rd day waiting for an hour to get my luggage checked in when there were only 3 people in front of me. Staff had no idea. This was from Regina to Denver. By the time we were done with staff we were already late for boarding.,1united-airlines,13/02/14,Just returned from a 3 week trip LHR-ORD-SEA returned ACV-SFO-LHR much better flight with united then previous flights in 2013. Inflight entertainment much improved food pretty much the same flew economy plus cabin free alcohol outbound but alcohol charged on the inbound flights. Far greater than Virgin Atlantic will fly United again when I travel in two months.,10united-airlines,12/02/14,Just flew United to Honolulu from Canada. Worst possible flight from Chicago. No entertainment no WiFi and absolutely no food or snacks were given. Mechanical issue delayed us for 2 hrs. Will never fly United again.,1united-airlines,11/02/14,My husband's father passed away 2 days ago. We scrambled to get him on a flight that wasn't too terribly expensive and would get him there in an expeditious manner. He flew from LAX to SFO. The plane he was supposed to be on in SFO had mechanical difficulties. They brought in another plane from Vegas. This second plane had problems as well. It took an additional 5.5 hours for him to get on his way to his family.,1united-airlines,10/02/14,Flew LAX-SFO-ORD-LAX last week in First. Had a really enjoyable service and even with a 45 minute weather delay due to incoming aircraft off the east coast still arrived in O'Hare relatively punctual. Outbound aircraft was the 737-900 with Boeing Sky Interior - which is very calming for a 4.5 hour flight. The only drawback was it was so new that the IFE hadn't been installed yet (not a deal-breaker as I normally read/work). Return aircraft 757-200 International config with on-demand. The best part of the trip were the crew. Both directions they were attentive and intuitive. They learned my drink order upon getting settled in and never had to ask again (with repeated re-fills). Menus have been upgraded and for a domestic First it was a great experience and worth the ticket.,9united-airlines,10/02/14,Delay of 4 hours then cancellation with another 4 hour wait for customer service on scheduled flight from SFO to HNL is totally unforgivable and there were no weather issues involved. Date of travel was to be 18 Jan 2014 and rebooked on 19 Jan 2014. Definitely cannot recommend United ever again.,1united-airlines,10/02/14,Took several flights in the last couple of months from EWR-HKG ORD-HKG NRT-EWR. The only positive item is inflight entertainment on the 777. Food: first meal - barely edible snack: unedible (half frozen sandwich) third meal: terrible. Now United have started charging for wine on such flights which last year didn't. Staff: terrible: I was given terrible attitude by a flight attendant didn't respond to several attendant calls for a long time. There are several airlines doing such routes all of them providing far better service than United.,1united-airlines,07/02/14,Flew from HKG-ORD and ORD to IAD. I had very low expectations on United. Surprisingly HKG-ORD ultra long haul flight has excellent service. Probably this is because the flight is staffed by Hong Kong-based crews. The 777-200ER aircraft has decent AVOD. Food is average but the crews offer multiple drink runs throughout the flight. ORD to IAD domestic flight is normal US standard. Only drink is served. PTV is useless unless you pay to watch Direct TV. Service by cabin crew very average. The experience is 4 star for the international flight and I would not hesitate to fly United if Hong Kong crews serve the flight.,7united-airlines,05/02/14,My pregnant wife and I had to fly to Maryland from Hawaii. As we were leaving for the airport I get a notification that the plane was experiencing mechanical issues and the flight was delayed. I contacted them and discussed how our delay was going to affect our connecting flight in San Francisco. I was told it would not be an issue. Upon arrival in San Francisco I learned that was not the case. I was told we had to wait a few hours and was going to Houston where I would be connected to Baltimore. We arrived in Houston and was greeted by another rude employee telling us the delay caused us to miss the connector to Baltimore and would get us a later flight putting us in Baltimore around 10pm and that was our only option. I walked outside to get some air and saw a supervisor at the ticket counter. I explained the story to her she offered to get on a flight that would put us in DC. On our arrival we learned that after what was to be a 12-13 hour flight that turned into a twenty something hour flight zig zagging across country. United did not have our luggage and it was sitting in an airport in New Jersey.,1united-airlines,04/02/14,Flight from Houston to SLC on 2/1/2014 a family of six including a 6 year old 4 year old and twin 2 year olds. When we checked in at the gate the gentleman at the gate was very short and rude and bluntly stated that we had not reserved our seating online as required when actually we had several months in advance. He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate. I would not recommend United Airlines to any families as none of our flights were accommodating to young families with kids and car seats as most airlines are.,1united-airlines,04/02/14,Lost bags delayed flights lack of communication wrong allocation of seats (such as row 50 in an airline that only has 46 rows) and rude staff have made my collective experience with United Airlines a negative one. To give them 1 star for each of these categories is a stretch. I wish I had read the reviews before booking so many flights with them as it seems that the rest of their previous customers are just as satisfied as I. Literally days wasted in airports and kilometres walked trying to get answers from staff who clearly are in the wrong line of work given their communication skills. Never again.,1united-airlines,03/02/14,"DEN-LHR on Christmas Eve. No food service for 50% of Economy class cabin as crew claimed that ground staff forgot to load enough food for all passengers in this class due to ""holiday mood"". When complained to crew they said it is unfortunate and can send letter to head office if dis-satisfied with service. Last time to fly with UA.",1united-airlines,03/02/14,Newark to Hong Kong in Economy Plus. The flight left early and arrived late which made for a 16.5 hour flight. It was a very smooth flight and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off 2 hours after take-off. I asked for a glass of red wine and was told that United began charging $7.99 a glass on flights across the Pacific Ocean on Jan 1 2014. No hot towels were provided. The meal came with plastic tableware. The individual in-flight entertainment worked well on the 777-200. 2 hours before landing there were a couple of bumps and the fasten seatbelt sign was on for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. On a 16 hour flight it is nice to use the toilet to freshen up before landing. No toothbrush or socks were provided. I purchased the more expensive W ticket because I had an upgrade but the business/first section was full two weeks before departure.,3united-airlines,03/02/14,I took United from Paris to Washington DC and then from DC to Richmond VA. The first flight was ok despite no communication or service from the crew. The second flight has one hour delay so far. Not very happy about flying with United. I won't recommend it.,1united-airlines,31/01/14,We flew from Newark to Panama City Panama. Flight arrived 30 mins late at 11pm. The flight was OK except for no entertainment as the paying entertainment was not worth it. No free food even that had to be paid for - we didn't. Pilots were pretty uncommunicative and the cabin crew indifferent. The seats are real torture too narrow hard and poor legroom combine to make 5 hours feel like forever!,2united-airlines,30/01/14,ORD-FLL on 18 January. Paid for upgrade to 1st class as a birthday treat! Very helpful staff at ORD to assist with check-in. As a Star Alliance Gold with A3 following security checks I was able to use the Club Lounge facilities. Being morning items for a continental type breakfast were available. The lounge was however very busy. The flight boarded on time and departed 30 minutes late due to airport operational issues at FLL. (out of the control of UA) Orders for breakfast were taken prior to departure (2 choices) and delivered in a friendly way while en-route. The aircraft B737-800 appeared new the cabin was clean and comfortable. In spite of the late departure the flight arrived in FLL around 5 minutes late.,8united-airlines,30/01/14,Flew Denver to Tokyo Flight left 2 hrs. late (mech) so we missed our connecting flight arrived 9 hrs late. On the way back they changed our seats at boarding and put us next to the bathroom got to hear the toilet flush and the door slam for 10 hours I'll never fly United again.,1united-airlines,29/01/14,IAD to DEN. Economy class on a 757. On time for departure and arrival quite good service from attendants. Aircraft sported outdated overhead CRT for in flight entertainment and my audio jack didn't work correctly. Also no wifi or power outlets. Seats comfy but a little small. Had to pay 9 dollars for a large snack which is too much frankly. Fine for the low fare I got but not much else.,7united-airlines,28/01/14,We flew to Geneva from ABQ on 1/16 - 1/26. Flight UA5176 UA907 UA975Y UA783Y. To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel. Very frustrating trip with United!,1united-airlines,25/01/14,IAH to CVG: Crowded dirty late with poor customer service from distracted personnel. They act like they simply don't care. If you enjoy riding Greyhound Bus Lines and want to have that same experience in the air fly United.,1united-airlines,25/01/14,I purchased first class tickets hoping to make the experience a little better it didn't help. The food on the flight is horrible. You get a snack box which consists of a couple of crackers some cheese spread a fig cookie and some kind of cranberry bar. That is not first class service to me. To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place. This took about 24 hours when it should have taken 2. To make matters even worse on the flight home my bags didn't make it again. I was told they got put on the later flight. I won't be flying United anymore.,1united-airlines,24/01/14,I personally have had few problems with them over the last several months. Recently did DEN-SFO-HNL and back. All flights on time and with early arrivals DEN-SFO segments with newer aircraft with PTVs. The SFO-HNL segments were on the oldest 777 I have ever seen - no food no entertainment nothing for 5 hours is not really acceptable. Crews smiled on all segments and actually seemed happy to be at work which is a change. Ground staff at SFO were also helpful.,8united-airlines,24/01/14,Flew United 261 LAX to Orlando Economy Plus. No music no movie (not even plug for headset) only ability to purchase wifi for $9.99. Remodelled seats with less padding.,5virgin-america,12/07/15,"First time with this airline, one way from LAX to ORD in First Class. Plane clean, seats comfortable, staff friendly from beginning to end. The food was good, although the salad (while good) was a bit small portion-wise. Would fly them again.",9virgin-america,01/07/15,No frills airline. Everything costs extra. No free checked luggage. All food and snacks cost money. Nickle and dime you to death. Little seats with little leg room. They or the connecting airline lost our luggage.,4virgin-america,13/06/15,I had a wonderful experience flying with Virgin America. The flight was very affordable and was on time. The staff were fun and friendly. I would definitely fly with them again. They had screens on the back of the seats and free videos to select. Very entertaining. ,10virgin-america,04/06/15,Flew on 9 May BOS-LAX on VX 365 and return 21 May on VX 366 first time flying Main Cabin Select and it's well worth paying the extra to do so maybe next time I'll get lucky enough to fly First Class. Flying in MCS gets you complimentary meals and non-alcoholic drinks and the meals offered are miles ahead of what any other U.S. carrier would offer. Cabin crews courteous and efficient both ways though a big letdown was when I couldn't charge either my iPod or iPad in an e-mail I received from VX Customer Relations they stated that too many devices charging at the same time results in a drain to the onboard power it is something they're working on and I received compensation for that inconvenience. I definitely would fly with them again despite the issues as they at least give you something for your trouble rather than telling you to scram.,8virgin-america,27/05/15,My first time with Virgin Air SeaTac to LAX. Customer service before the flight and at check in at SeaTac was excellent but flight delayed both ways. Lap trays not clean. Armrest not cleaned. Leg room - poor. Person next to me asked to buy headphones - sorry none available. No room in overhead! Perhaps because of new $25 bag check in rule! Much boasting about the Virgin Air experience - but it was very average or below average.,4virgin-america,20/05/15,VX 927 LAX-SFO. Uneventful on-time flight good service value for money but free checked baggage only max 14 kg.,9virgin-america,22/04/15,Flew FLL to LAX earlier this month. We were flying back from a cruise. The flight was unfortunately delayed 90 minutes. Once on-board the pilot apologized sincerely and gave everyone unlimited movies through the in-flight entertainment system for their inconvenience. In a world where airlines strand passengers on the tarmac for 7 hours (United 4/18/15 with no apologies) its nice to know that at least one airline still cares for its customers. I am a loyal flyer!,10virgin-america,14/04/15,"PDX to SFO 1st week April First Class cabin. Long-time VA customer with ""gold"" status. In short VA is looking a bit 'tired'. Service is inconsistent (eg like any organization most employees are good to great but the bad ones really stick out especially if they are 'experienced'). On this flight the seat was broken the food terrible and cabin service questionable. The plane interior is a bit tattered and worn from wear (ie soiled). Also the ""mod"" safety video is outdated (ie ""can I have just the facts please"") and it's a bit odd that alcohol is served at 7am in the morning. Thus this customer is starting to explore alternatives (which are best left unnamed in this post).",2virgin-america,19/03/15,On 8th March I flew Virgin America in economy from SFO to LAS for $49.00 return. Was looking forward to the flight and it proved to be a positive experience. I was a bit put off by the loud rock music blaring by the check-in kiosk and a rather indifferent ground attendant herding people to and from the check-in area. I feel that airports are confusing and loud enough without the added distraction of loud music. I liked the mood lighting onboard and flight and crew very pleasant although the safety video was entertaining but to me a tad playful. The baggage charge of $25.00 was expected and on my return on the 10th of March I upgraded to First for $89.00 so the baggage fee was waived. The seats in First are very comfortable and pre-take off drinks were served by a very pleasant stewardess. Value for money on Virgin America on this trip was great and if you have checked baggage do the upgrade-it's well worth it.,10virgin-america,17/03/15,Feb 27 2015 from FLL to LAX. Crew were rude and annoyed if you spoke to them. It was the first time I flew that they didn't walk down the aisle to ask if anyone wanted to buy headsets. When I asked the steward about the headsets she was annoyed that I didn't purchase on the computer screen. I really didn't want to wait another hour and she basically threw them at me and said to pay for them when I got a chance. On my flight home March 9 2015 as I was boarding the steward told the boarding agent that there was no more room for luggage in overhead bins. I was not happy about giving up my bag as I had things in there that should not go in a checked bag. She was insistent. When I finally boarded the flight there were 3 or 4 empty compartments right where I was sitting. I asked for my bags to be brought back too late was the answer.,2virgin-america,24/02/15,I was sending 3 people out to Los Angeles for a job and the flight from JFK was cancelled with no reason given. it was a 7am flight and no other flights that day were cancelled. They had no seats available in later flights for me and no affiliations with other airlines so they said there was nothing they could do. I had to scramble at 9pm that night and spend 3 times as much to get them out to Los Angeles.,virgin-america,19/01/15,"I sat in Economy but paid the $30 to have expedited security and boarding privileges. I was seated in 4D right behind Economy Select. This is probably the best Economy cabin I've traveled in. Stylish comfortable decent amount of room (I'm 6'3""). The staff are well-groomed and enthusiastic. There was some shenanigans on board with two parties who kept wanting to switch seats and the flight attendants handled it with humor and ease. I had a short flight under three hours so the complimentary entertainment options on RED were plenty for me. Also when I went to the restroom the flight attendant opened the door for me. When I went in it was quite large well lit and played spa music. Also when washing my hands the faucet actually stayed on long enough for me to wash my hands instead of me having to keep depressing it. Again a small thing but it's this list of small things about Virgin that have made me a loyal customer. I paid $49 for my trip from DC to Dallas. For $49 I got: excellent service comfortable economy seating and free entertainment. If I have to list one negative I'd say it's the fact that the remote control for the entertainment system is a bit challenging to use.",9virgin-america,19/01/15,Overall I like Virgin however the beverage and staff service was very poor. Ordered a wine and it took two hours to arrive. Ordered a simple soft drink twice and never arrived but the monitor showed as completed. Was working and very difficult to get out from my seat.,5virgin-america,14/01/15,San Francisco to Boston in December 2014. I felt truly welcomed by the courteous ground staff who went out of their way to help me check in at the kiosks which were malfunctioning that day. I was looking forward to the flight but was greatly disappointed by the aloof demeanour of the attendants on the flight that day who seemed more interested in associating with each other than serving passengers and making us feel welcome. I realize that Virgin America is a low cost no frills carrier with a modern flair but the flight attendants on duty that day should take a lesson from the charming pilots heading the flight by at least cracking a smile and welcoming passengers on board rather than avoiding eye contact and appearing preoccupied with personal concerns. Moreover I was greatly disappointed by the lack of hot meals sold on board where small cold sandwiches and junk food consisting of crackers chips and cookies dominate the in flight menu. If you're hungry I would recommend bringing your own food on board.,3virgin-america,14/01/15,SFO/LAX F 12/28/14 early morning flight - very good service but 'breakfast' is a joke - trying to be cute with tiny squares of cheese 1/2 strawberry etc. - a bowl of cheerios would be much better. I like their style but hate the food offerings (have only flown SFO/LAX and v.v.).,7virgin-america,18/12/14,LAX-DAL in Main Cabin Select 08/12/14. We checked in online and utilized the express bag drop at LAX. There was a short line and we were attended to promptly by a cheerful agent. Main Cabin Select comes with priority security so we sailed through the TSA line. T3 at LAX is rather dour though this isn't VX's fault. Boarding started on time and we pushed back a few minutes early. The safety video is cheesy and gets annoying pretty quickly but otherwise service was excellent. FAs weren't exceptional but they were friendly and efficient and I personally think all airlines should adopt the in-seat ordering system for food and beverages you select whatever you want at your leisure and an FA brings it to you within a couple of minutes. Leather seat was comfortable and had plenty of legroom thanks to the bulkhead. Snacks were of good quality and the meal I ordered was tasty but not excessively heavy. We landed nearly 15 minutes early and we were in our car and on our way about 20 minutes after landing. Main Cabin Select is a good value as it includes one checked bag priority boarding and security and food and drink at no extra charge. We were impressed with VX will consider them more often now that they've beefed up service from Dallas.,10virgin-america,10/12/14,I purchased an Economy Select Aisle seat I boarded the plan situated myself in the seat and within a few minutes was asked by a Virgin employee to see my boarding pass. They indicated another passenger had the same seat assignment who had the same last name as me. It turns out that this other person bought a different seat and at the gate an employee made an error and changed his seat to mine thinking he was me. Virgin didn't handle the situation well and out of respect for getting the plane boarded and on it's way I gave up my seat that I paid extra for and took and inferior seat. Virgin didn't offer to boat me for what I didn't end up getting and I don't have time to call them and complain. I'm certain they wouldn't reimburse me anyway. As far as flight operations our flight was Lax to Boston it took off 2 hours late because the invoking flight was late they kept the flight listed as on time even though they knew it was late hours before. Loading the plane took much longer than JetBlue or Southwest and I found the head seat entertainment system difficult to use. I will never fly them again.,3virgin-america,01/12/14,I flew from LGA-DAL in their infancy of their LaGuardia to Dallas-Love Field route. Going through security at LaGuardia was quick and smooth. Never had any problems. Virgin's gate is the diamond in the rough of what is Terminal B in LaGuardia. Boarding was on time for both ways of the flights. The seats in Economy Class were fair and decently spacious with its leather exterior and cushion. The DISH Network with the regular channels sufficed for me both ways. The ability to order drinks at my seat was a first but very interesting. You select your desired drink and the attendants bring it to your seat. It was a great experience flying Virgin. No fuss no muss. Definitely get your bang for the buck.,8virgin-america,20/11/14,San Francisco to Washington/DCA Nov 8-Nov 11. Both ways boarded early and left the gate early. Our flight attendant started us off with whatever drink we wanted before the people in main cabin were even onboard. The nice mood lighting and the seats that go almost all the way was excellent. The airlines Red system is excellent and fast. Right after takeoff with a hot towel then onto warmed nuts next was a smoked turkey orange and pistachio salad which was very yummy. For my main course I had a filet mignon which was very juicy and cooked perfectly. Also the flight attendant came around often with great snacks. Will be flying Virgin America more often!,10virgin-america,17/11/14,Flight 27 - JFK to SFO on November 11 2014. Check-in was a breeze. TSA pre-check was a breeze. Seats were in economy. Inflight service was very good. Staff on the ground and in-flight were courteous and friendly. Finally and to my surprise baggage at SFO came out in what seems to be record time.,10virgin-america,28/10/14,LA -Seattle First Class Oct 11. A very comfortable nice experience. The snack lunch offered was perfect and nicely presented the service very nice and the seat just fine for a short flight but not good enough for a trans con in my opinion. One important note the tragically hip safety announcement has to go. It is jarring loud and actually encourages one to not pay attention to important information. I understand the attempt but the execution is embarrassing.,9virgin-america,13/10/14,"Oct 1st LAX-LAS in First. Great experience although disappointed that VX chooses to disclude a few routes from access to its lounge at LAX as they are considered short haul. Did not know that U.S. domestic coast to coast flights were considered ""long"" haul and thus given access to lounges. I just think passengers choosing to fly First have different needs for travel and throwing them to Starbucks and Burger King with 2000 other screaming passengers is not a bright idea especially as there are no other lounges to choose at the terminal VX flies from in LAX. Anyway once in air nice experience. Clean beautiful cabins smooth service and welcome champagne offered upon seating. On time and otherwise smooth experience.",6virgin-america,08/10/14,Just flew with Virgin America for the first time: SFO to ORD. Boarding was done efficiently and we left early. Flight was very smooth and we arrived early. Captain came around and introduced himself (a first for me!). Our flight attendant was very professional and made sure all our needs were met. I liked the soothing cabin lighting and the wide selection of movies. I highly recommend this airline they have brought back the fun of flying.,10virgin-america,10/09/14,We were flying from San Francisco to Philadelphia. The first thing I saw when we checked our bags in was how nice the staff were and there was peaceful music on with colorful seats. In a good mood we started to board. I noticed they had screens on the back of seats were you could watch TV play games and order food and drinks. It was the best flight I have taken! I will be coming back.,10virgin-america,06/09/14,Flew VX 928 on 24 Aug 14 SFO-LAX. The aircraft was clean and the ground and cabin staff were helpful. On a flight of 1 hour were offered only snacks from the basket which meant potato chips candy bars etc. The pre- flight safety video was quite annoying as it was more or less a sing-song of instructions to follow with a rap- type beat.,7virgin-america,01/09/14,Flew LAX - SFO 19 Aug in Main Cabin. The short flight was on time the aircraft clean and the staff very friendly. The leg room was also sufficient - my wife struggles with some seats on other airlines as she has long legs - no problems here. A great experience and thoroughly recommended.,9virgin-america,28/08/14,"Flight 805 and 136 on August 16 2014. My first time on Virgin America. I only had a 35 min. layover in San Francisco. We all know what that means or usually means: missed connecting flight long layover into wee hours of the night bags on different plane. The gate attendant told me ""not to worry"". The flight from Portland was 30 min. late leaving we arrived in San Francisco just as my flight was scheduled to leave. To my amazement an airport attendant was doing down the ramp and called out my name. When I answered she said: ""Follow Me. Your flight is waiting for you!"" Sure enough she walked me to my gate and on I went. Seat was still available (amazing). A place for my overhead bag right by my seat (even more amazing). As I buckled in I noticed there was not only a place to plug in my iPod but a screen at each seat with a remote so you weren't poking the person in front of you all the time! I was able through the programs to select a beverage any time I wished and they brought it asap! The icing on the cake was that my bag was transferred to my plane in that short window of time and it was one of the first to pop out of the chute! I will be booking on Virgin American for all possible future flights.",10virgin-america,18/08/14,First class LAX to PHL: The flight attendant was in the front of the plane for about 30 minutes of the entire 5 hour flight. We did not get a drink until 20 minutes into the flight. This is the 6th first class flight with Virgin and this will be the last. I had to push my call button to get a drink and my dirty dishes cleaned up! Never once did they show they were happy to have you on board. If this had been a one time event I could over look it but there seems to be a theme here.,1virgin-america,18/08/14,Sound be called Nickel and Dime Airlines. I had flown Virgin Atlantic to London from LAX and thought Virgin America would be just as good. Was I wrong! Surly staff and charge upon charge for everything. Disorganized boarding in Los Angeles with a very rude ticket agent. There was a 3 hour delay to NY because of the weather not their fault. When we landed in NY some Delta passengers who had taken the same route (LAX-JFK) and also been delayed told us they were given free headphones food and drinks to compensate. Virgin America didn't give us anything. Never again.,5virgin-america,15/08/14,SEA-LAX in Y on an A319. Good inflight service from the crew and an early arrival into LAX. Inflight safety video certainly got our attention.,10virgin-america,31/07/14,LAX-PHL October 2013. Hawaiian Air booked our flight since they don't fly to Philadelphia they did the leg LAX- PHL on Virgin America. We upgraded and paid I believe an extra $129 for the one way upgrade for a flight that would be 5 hours and a little more. This was one of the best things we spent money on we got to pick the very first row after first class its separated by a see through partition. We also got more leg space early boarding lots of entertainment to pick from. Prior to the flight spoke to several CSR on the phone and everyone I spoke to was very nice and professional. Since we upgraded we got unlimited food and drinks you just order on the screen in front and its delivered to your seat in a timely manner. The selections were very good. The flight attendants were pleasant.,10virgin-america,31/07/14,Sydney Australia to Philadelphia USA via Hilo and Maui Hawaii. My trip started at Sydney business class on Hawaiian airlines I'm a Platinum member and have been for countless years I was met in the business line by the always attentive and friendly station manager who made sure I had no hiccups in checking in and off and had a good meal and few drinks in Air NZ lounge. Flight was nice wasn't the best crew but they were professional and consistent. Arrive Honolulu get through customs quickly and managed to transfer to an early inter island flight a perk for being platinum. 1st class Hilo to Maui quick 49min flight all on time. LAX to Philadelphia - this was my first time in first class and it will not be my last - great crew and food. The staff were all polite professional and helpful. My return trip was quick smooth check-in at Philadelphia. I took main cabin select as first was full this too is a great product food and drinks included and delivered via an order system built into your TV screen. Wifi was very cheap - 11 dollars for 3 hours.,9virgin-america,31/07/14,SFO to JFK on 7/24/14 and JFK to SFO on 7/28/14. Check-in (baggage drop) was uneventful and went quickly. Counter staff were courteous. Both flights went well. Pleasant attentive flight crew. Seats were comfortable for me but I am not particularly tall or overweight. There was enough free content on the seat back entertainment system to keep me occupied on the cross country flights. Having a dedicated AC electrical outlet ensured that my I-Pad stayed functional.,10virgin-america,01/07/14,We flew with Virgin America on our return flight from JFK New York to LAX. The plane was near new and well appointed. We were most disappointed with the flight crew on the flight. We were seated near the rear of the plane close to the galley and toilets and had to put up with crew talking amongst themselves quite loudly for lengthy times during the flight which was annoying when we were trying to sleep. We would try to avoid using them again if we can.,3virgin-america,01/07/14,I flew on Virgin America flight #89 at 9.15am today from IAD to LAX in First Class. Other than asking me which breakfast dish I would like the flight attendant did not offer me anything to drink or ask if I needed anything for the five+ hour long flight. Not only that but I had a hard time getting her attention the entire flight. With 40 minutes left in the flight I finally waved her down and asked her for water. I have flown over 5 million miles on American Airlines alone and I have been considering Virgin as an ideal alternative until I spent as much as I did for first class and literally had to track down our flight attendant for a glass of water. My experiences with the positive attitude of Southwest Airlines' and American Airlines' flight attendants have been exceptional compared to today with Virgin.,1virgin-america,25/06/14,"Flew from JFK to Vegas on 16th June 2014. The check in experience at JFK was absolutely horrific with snarling aggressive staff who took great delight in seating 4 of us in totally separate areas of the plane. Perhaps it was because it was early on Monday morning or perhaps it was because when they found out we had already paid the $25 baggage tariff whatever the reason we appeared to have completely ruined their day such was their complete and utter contempt towards us. There was no eye contact no communication whatsoever just the faintest of a wry smile when she saw our shock at the seating arrangements we had been given. When challenged the response was ""that's the best I could do"". They have lost 4 passengers.",virgin-america,25/06/14,Flight from LAX flight number 781 6/21/14-6/25/14. My first time on this aircraft and I loved it. The seats were comfortable and the TV sets were excellent! The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. I would recommend.,10virgin-america,25/06/14,June 13th VX321 FLL-LAX. June 18thVX334 LAX-FLL. We heard so much about Virgin America and how they are the best to fly. When we departed the staff at the gate were not friendly. When we got on the plane to LA there was one very friendly flight attendant. The rest seemed annoyed. I ordered a Coke for my son and it never came so I asked a flight attendant she never came back with it then it was I guess 45 min. before landing and another attendant came around and when asked she said I need to order it on the screen and the ordering time was up I told her I ordered it on the screen over an hour ago and she acted like she didn't believe me so she checked my screen then went and got the drink. When going back home to Ft. Laud the ticket counter girl in LA was rude didn't tell us what gate to go to then the flight attendants were very rude - again as if they were annoyed to be there and the remote controls and TV screens were sticky and filthy. The good thing is that the pilot got us there and back on time as scheduled and it was a non-stop flight. I think Virgin America needs some serious Customer Service training implemented.,7virgin-america,04/06/14,Flew SFO-DCA and EWK-LAX in Main cabin Select. Very comfortable seats with additional legroom. The cabin crew were friendly on both sectors. I consider VA to be one of the best airlines I have flown with.,9virgin-america,27/05/14,Virgin trip from Las Vegas to NYC was the worst flight I've ever had. The staff (a supervisor and her sidekick) at the terminal was crude and unprofessional. This will be my last trip on Virgin and I suspect they will continue to lose customers given the quality of their staff.,virgin-america,01/05/14,SFO-LAX-MCO on 4/24/14 and return on 4/30/14. Overall good flights. Friendly attentive in-flight crews. Seats are comfortable enough for me. I believe they are slightly larger than on many other airlines. There are enough free entertainment options (Direct TV music) to keep me happy. The only problem encountered was not Virgin's fault - the Air Traffic Control system went down in Los Angeles on 4/30 and screwed up everything. Our 9.30pm departure from LAX to SFO ended up leaving at 1.35am. It would be nice if the FAA would get their act together.,10virgin-america,27/04/14,Paid for the main cabin select upgrade not really worth the extra money. Flew from SFO-FLL. This was the most unfriendly flight crew I have ever flown with. No smiles no real interaction. Made me feel guilty for asking for a soda. Virgin really needs to make improvements with their staff.,4virgin-america,23/04/14,Be prepared to pay for everything. Additional costs you don't think of when booking your flight added $90 more dollars to my trip: Check baggage meal and a movie. The seats are cramped and I'm a petite person. I flew to DC from San Diego changed planes in San Francisco. All day internet pass was 16$ from San Diego to San Francisco same all day internet pass from San Francisco to DC was 36$. You would think an all day pass would be the same price The days don't get longer only the flights. Greedy very Greedy. I will never fly Virgin again.,1virgin-america,22/04/14,"Who designed the seats? It reclines about 1/2 inch and feels like 1/4. When it's in it's upright position I actually felt like I was leaning forward. ""Put your seats in an upright position before landing?"" The seat is upright when it's fully reclined! My elbow kept going into the armrest channel / volume control which was carefully positioned to maximum discomfort. My red eye flight from LAX to FLL left me with a mangled spine and crooked neck. I won't even mention the embarrassing prices to watch an in flight movie or TV show.",3virgin-america,14/04/14,Boston - LAX April 9. Possibly the worst cabin attendants I have ever experienced no communication skills almost threw the food at us were of no other assistance (even though we were in cabin select). The cabin crew spent most of the flight watching movies or reading magazines at the rear of the plane. Cabin select was of no value at all. Travelling cabin select was a worse experience than travelling economy with Delta.,1virgin-america,13/04/14,Flew SFO-FLL on 3/17/14 first class (seats 1 AB). Check-in at SFO was fast and efficient and took only a few minutes with no one in front of us. The lounge at SFO is futuristic but unattractive with an overdose of reds and blacks and uncomfortable seating. Boarding was quick with no problem. The flight crew was aloof and seemed preoccupied. They all wear street clothes. Although well attired - no uniforms? It appears very unprofessional and exudes little confidence. There is no closet for garments. I was told to store my jacket in the overhead bin - really? In first class? Food service was mediocre at best. A choice of two appetizers and two entrees. We ordered the rice noodles main course and as I don't expect anything close to gourmet food the food was cold and inedible. The flight attendant was nowhere to be found although seen frequently during the flight sitting in the jump seat in the galley. Although dessert was included as part of the meal service none was provided. I emailed customer service with my comments and received no reply which I find inexcusable.,2virgin-america,06/04/14,SAN-SFO-SAN. Apr 5 return Apr 6. Flights 961 there 960 back. Very pleased with our trip on VA. Nice little hummus / mozzarella / vegetable tray along with a snack basket selection on both flights. Comfortable seats and friendly cabin attendants. Both flights arrived early. Pilots gave first PA greeting on both flights - nice touch. Love the whole Virgin America ambience on board.,10virgin-america,27/03/14,EWR-LAX. Airbus Industrie A320 JET. The Ground Crew was fine. When we got on the plane the seats were very crammed in but the cabin crew was good. You had to pay for basically anything you want on a plane food movies $8.00 but the juice was free. We didn't reserve seat so they put us at the back of the plane where you heard the flight attendants talking loudly. In the bathroom the sink was odd and they didn't announce how to use it. Eventually figured it out. I ended up watching TV shows on my computer. I'll never fly with them again if I don't have to.,3virgin-america,24/03/14,Flew LAX-FLL Flt 330 on Mar 17 2014 - seat 1A-1B. The check-in process was efficient quick and courteous. Upon boarding I asked the flight attendant for a place to hang my suit jacket. I was advised that there is no closet and to place it flat in the overhead bin. The flight attendants were very inattentive. Most of the time spent in the jump seat reading. Meal service included a meagre salad and a choice of two entrees. I choose the rice noodles. The food was not heated properly. Although dessert was included on the menu none was offered. Seats do not fully recline to flat bed but were reasonably comfortable for the 5 hour flight. In-flight entertainment was good and included various selections in addition to satellite live broadcasts.,3virgin-america,14/03/14,"Seat rows are jammed together cramped and seats have a bulky non-removable head ""rest"" which compelled me to tip my head forward and down pushing my face even closer to the already too-close seat in front of me. This was unendurable in an overnight flight when I longed to recline as much as possible but was forced into this forward- head position. Aisle was so narrow that it was impossible to avoid knocking into seated passengers when navigating to the restroom (I am slim and small). Horrible experience. Hard to imaging ever flying VA again.",1virgin-america,03/03/14,Flew an evening flight from DFW to SFO on A320 non-stop. First time on Virgin overall pleased with the flight. Amble leg room seating good food good service great IFE was very good compared to others which had none. Highly recommend and would fly again fare hard to beat.,10virgin-america,28/02/14,Disappointed with a round-trip SFO-LAX-SFO in Main Cabin Select - food selection is pretty pathetic - the 'Hearty Meal' is a box containing a tiny bag of some kind of chips/crisps about 4 slices of salami and a little pot of something else. Service was generally very good on both flights - but again my unfortunate neighbor tried to order a snack on the menu that apparently was not available - the flight attendant said 'only what's on the menu on the screen' - his choice was included in the on-screen menu! It was a long day and so the lighting did nothing for me but the general atmosphere is much better than UA and I would probably choose them again. Thankfully they have upgraded their sparkling wine since my last flight with them a few years ago!,7virgin-america,25/02/14,I flew from Las Vegas to San Fran with a connecting flight from San Fran to Philadelphia. After flying with Spirit from Philly to Las Vegas this was a welcoming experience. First time flying with Virgin I got a really good deal. Wanted to change my flight at the last min but prices were outrageous. A $900 difference. But other than that I would definitely recommend this airline to travelers. Traveled with elderly father and the wheelchair assistance and their employees were great with the airline and the employees at Las Vegas and San Fran. Philly was not overly friendly but that was to be expected.,1virgin-america,21/02/14,Outgoing SFO-JFK. Return JFK-SFO. The seating comfort legroom food quality and selection and entertainment on Virgin America has declined over the last year from my personal rating of Very Good to Great to Disappointing at Best and Very Uncomfortable. Seat size and legroom as a standard have declined markedly and steadily. Both of my recent flights on American and United have had better seats more leg room and much better food. The selection of videos and entertainment has decreased. Lastly is the food - it is cheap. The choice of entrees are worse than you can find in a gas station. Regardless of the abysmal conditions currently on VA the people are uniformly very nice and do the best they can. I paid an extra $399 on this trip to upgrade to first class after I boarded the plane and found that I could not turn my shoulders in a standard exit row seat with a seat mate of normal weight and size as am I. A big price to pay just to be able to have room for my laptop. Food was OK but nothing close to the many other first class meals I've had.,3virgin-america,15/02/14,LAX to Dulles October 2013. This was my first trip on Virgin America and I will save the additionally money to fly with them next time. I love being able to order food/drinks on the interactive screen and watch the news as well credit card automatically charged for any expenditures and the information is deleted after the flight hits close to your destination. The seat I had was an aisle one and very comfortable really it seemed like just after we took off it was time to buckle down for landing. The only thing I can find to criticize has nothing to do with Virgin it has to do with Dulles it's quite a trip from the main lobby where Virgin is located to the actual gate involving elevators and a subway train ride.,10virgin-america,12/02/14,IAD to SFO on 2/11/14. Friendly courteous and attentive cabin crew and staff at check-in counter. Everything went well. Baggage claim at SFO seemed to take a bit longer than usual.,10virgin-america,07/01/14,SFO to IAD on 2/6/14. Check-in was quick. Friendly agent at check-in counter. Boarding went quickly. Attentive and friendly cabin crew. Flight arrived early (tail winds). Bags were already in baggage claim by the time we got there from the aircraft. Great experience from start to finish.,10virgin-america,07/01/14,San Francisco to Fort Lauderdale and back via Los Angeles. 1/25/14 and 2/2/14. Never ever again VA. You can't recline the seats. The arm rest is super uncomfortable since the remote control is on top of it. You don't even get a bag of nuts on a 6 hour flight you have to pay for it which means you need to get you cc out of the overhead compartment but everything is so tight. The airplane kitchen is almost in the tiny bathroom. The stewards have hardly room to manage anything. But they have a rap song to tell you how to put on your seat belt. You have to pay for movies ear phones and no pillow or blanket.,virgin-america,02/01/14,First and last trip on Virgin America. I had flown Virgin Atlantic to London years ago and had a bad experience. Uncomfortable seats no legroom. This time round trip LAX / JFK. Really not good. The worst terminal at LAX. Bad food. Flight was late. Seat terribly uncomfortable. Still No Legroom. Bad TV choices. No free movies you've heard of. On the return flight my seat was broken and didn't recline. Staff was unconcerned. They charge $25 per bag and don't provide a meal - I guess this is common but on Jet Blue they don't charge for a bag and the seats are comfortable. Nothing to recommend this airline except nice lighting and music.,2virgin-america,02/01/14,Flew in Sept 2013 from LAX to JFK. My mother and I were very impressed and we felt at home after flying Virgin Australia domestically within Australia. The 2 airlines are very similar. Nice new plane clean interior with mood lighting. Wide selection of food available to purchase at a reasonable price. Nice smooth flight across the country. Whizzed through check-in early morning flight in LA. We love that the planes all have quirky funny names!,10virgin-america,23/12/13,"Flight 187 from Newark to San Francisco Dec 20 2013. The aircraft was cold when we boarded and we were told the heating would be turned on once the door was closed and there was nothing they could do in the interim. So we all actually went into our bags and pulled out our jackets to put them on. When I was offered a beverage before takeoff I asked for a hot tea I was told there would be no hot beverages before takeoff. I was offered the lunch menu for our flight however they insisted on serving lunch at 11 am (origin time) which was 8 am at our destination. There was no question or flexibility of serving the meal even an hour later even though it was a 6 hour flight. As is customary a few minutes before the plane began the initial descent for landing there was an announcement to facilitate those who need to go to the restroom or access the overhead bins before the fasten seatbelt light comes on. However immediately after the stewardess made the PA announcement she went into the only first class restroom there was and stayed in there for 20 mins. No one in first class could use the restroom because the fasten seatbelt light was switched on by the time the stewardess came out. She apologized as she walked by us with her make-up bag under her arm. Given I paid $3600 for this first class round-trip to NY I have to confess that for the first time in my experience with Virgin America did I find it to to be an inferior airline to United. Additionally it seems that Virgin America has lost it's ""cool"" factor. Case in point is the new safety video which is stylistically a cross between a badly choreographed low budget broadway musical and a 90's jingle from a supermarket detergent ad.",1virgin-america,21/12/13,Arrived at SFO from SEA for a connecting flight to Las Vegas. Flight was delayed first one hour then two hours and then 3 hrs. The gate crew kept reassuring that a part was being installed in the plane and it would be ready for loading. The flight was cancelled after 4 hours. I was booked on another flight and not compensated for anything. I had to take the last seat available and missed all my connections for ground transportation to Utah. This is my second and last bad experience with Virgin America.,1virgin-america,02/12/13,SFO-SJD-SFO main cabin going main cabin select return. Both flights left on time and arrived 15-30 minutes early. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful despite grumbling from some passengers on the fully booked flights. The extra legroom in main cabin select was well worth the additional cost.,10virgin-america,27/11/13,This is my first experience with Virgin America and unfortunately it will be my last. Just set up two tickets to LAX from DFW. On one ticket the online system allowed me to select a seat next to the other ticket but as I proceeded to check out it declared I had not selected a seat. On the 4th try the seat selection still did not work and the fare increased another $40+. I called for assistance and was told seat was available and that they handled it. When I asked about the increase in fare they said yes that is the way it works sometimes if you are on the system for 15 minutes the fares can increase. This is not the consumers fault that Virgin's online system did not work properly but they penalize the consumer. DFW is extremely competitive and this cost Virgin two customers.,virgin-america,15/11/13,Main Cabin Select is comfortable and they throw in enough amenities including priority TSA lines to make it worth the extra price. Main Cabin is not a good experience. The seats are really small and close together and they make you pay for everything. The DISH Network TV is free but the programming is very mediocre and on my flight the sound kept going out. They also constantly interrupt your viewing with announcements which get pretty grating when it's pumped directly into your head. Southwest's regular seats are significantly more comfortable than Virgin America's Main Cabin and JetBlue give you free snacks. The flight crew were courteous but there's far too much activity in the cabin with the flight attendants bringing snacks and drinks to passengers on almost a continual basis because everyone can place orders on their TV screens.,2virgin-america,15/11/13,SF Vegas LA. Two short but great flights in first class. Light delicious snacks extremely comfortable seats and eager to please staff on the ground and in the air. This is how it should be done up front.,10virgin-america,29/10/13,I was so disappointed. I had a 4 hour flight in a very tight uncomfortable space. The couple behind me had 2 small children that were uncontrollable. They kicked my seat the whole flight and cried the whole trip. The TV wasn't working and I really doubt that headphones would have helped the situation. My flight back was not much better. I was so excited for my trip and had heard great things about Virgin Airlines but I was completely let down.,5virgin-america,18/10/13,I flew on flight 720 from Dallas to San Francisco and I had a great experience. The flight attendants were excellent check-in was great and the flight left on time! Satisfied customer.,10virgin-america,13/10/13,Flew from BOS-SFO-BOS and continue to be impressed it's definitely a cut above the competition. Nice new planes with comfortable leather seats and cool lighting. Crews are always friendly. Good selection of both free satellite TV and pay per view. Also love the online ordering on the seatback TV but wish they stocked just a few more fresh food options (usually you get a choice of a couple of light options such as wraps and salads but wish they would have more substantial choices to choose from). Also the powerports at every seat really makes a difference. One small detail that is easily overlooked but which I greatly appreciate is the Google Maps feature that tracks where your plane is. Unlike other airlines (JetBlue and Frontier) who keep on interrupting the Map View every few seconds with their annoying ads the Virgin version is ad-free.,10virgin-america,10/10/13,Flew on their 09.50 service from JFK to Las Vegas on 5th October. This was my first experience of VA and they were brilliant. The flight attendants were friendly helpful and polite. The cabin was pristine and the mood lighting added to the whole ambience of calm. If this is typical of the airline then what a fantastic product and I look forward to flying with them again.,10virgin-america,29/09/13,BOS-SFO. Inbound flight was great. Traveling Main Cabin Select was worth the extra money. All entertainment food drinks and baggage was included. I loved the priority security. My one complaint was that on the return flight they turned off the ordering system about 2 hours prior to landing. It really negated the free food and drinks. They did offer a bottle of water though.,8virgin-america,25/09/13,VA 752 from LAX to SFO was scheduled to depart at 11.20pm but was delayed because the clouds were below 2000ft which it can't so SFO close the airport. Departure was pushed back to 12.30pm and Virgin did not inform us until we reached the gate. We boarded the plane finally and right back into the delay segment again same problem with SFO. However the captain and the crew was excellent and displayed true professionalism and great service. Captain went about and personally informed passengers of the problem and the FA made jokes which cheered us up. Delays continued as we sat on the tarmac for another 1 hr before we finally took off at 3.20pm. Without the positive attitude from its FA this flight would be miserable but luckily it was not.,8virgin-america,18/09/13,Flew JFK to SFO. A small plane six seats wide. Three on either side. Seats were crammed in. I paid extra for an express seat but don't see what value actually received for that other than getting on board second to the last calling. In the front it was terribly warm with little air circulation. The flights were longer than that of a larger plane which I would fly on American Airlines. I was so miserable and so uncomfortable. Would never fly this airline again. Never.,3virgin-america,26/08/13,LAX-EWR on 22/6/13 for a red-eye and returned 19/7/13 with an EWR-LAX flight in the late afternoon. Overall Virgin has proved to have better service better planes and an overall better atmosphere than the likes of American Airlines and United when I have flown in the past. Their fee policy wasn't bad compared to other airlines. For the most part at least water and soda were free. The cabin crews had no problem on either flight providing me these at all. From baggage drop-off to disembarkation Virgin provided a quality service. The one caveat I had was having to use the rear-lavatory each flight because the front is reserved for First Class only. Because I paid $30 for Main Cabin Express (it's worth it despite this) I feel it to be a slap in the face to exclusively use the read one when the front is less of a hassle. As far as the seats go they are the most comfortable I have ever sat in for an aircraft. I always had smelly or worn fabric when flying American. Plus I wasn't scrunched up in Economy with Virgin coming from a 6ft guy. All that really mattered to me is that I was able to get free drinks (with no hassle from stewards) my baggage came back in one piece I could actually recline a little and sleep comfortably and I didn't miss my favourite primetime shows while in the air!,9virgin-america,19/08/13,First time on this airline but am very impressed clean customer friendly plane and the crew were very friendly interactive with passengers and let you know they appreciated your business. Flew from Vegas to Frisco then on to Portland OR. At all 3 places there was always a VA staff member to see if they could help or get you something. Had a 2 hour layover in SF and I was in a wheelchair someone came about every 15 to 20 mins to see if I needed to go anywhere or get anything.,10virgin-america,18/08/13,Return flight from Los Angeles to Orlando. Checked in very early and upgraded to Main Cabin Select. Upgrade includes a checked bag a free head set and unlimited food drinks and movies on demand onboard. The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat. Crews on both flights did not tidy up the restrooms which were always in great demand. I highly recommend upgrading to Main Cabin Select especially for cross country flights on Virgin America.,8virgin-america,18/08/13,LAX-SFO: Simple flight made easier by a relaxed crew. Great entertainment system blankets and pillows and a nice flow of a small meal and after-meal snack plus plenty to drink. Flight crew was very attentive from the moment of boarding and remained friendly throughout. Never had a grumpy flight crew with Virgin which cannot be said for other domestic carriers. Really great if you're a fan of the SF Giants on this particular route as they show World Series highlights on the SF Giants channel.,10virgin-america,18/08/13,Traveled from Newark to LAX. I don't particularly enjoy flying but was comforted by the soft lighting and happy faces on the attendants. The service was great. The seats were definitely roomier than any other airline that I've been on. Captain's updates timely and comforting. Food - no complaint. Also took Virgin back from LAX 2 weeks later. Same great service seats attendants cleanliness.,9virgin-america,18/08/13,"Orlando-Los Angeles. I arrived early at the airport plenty of staff on hand and baggage was accepted without a wait. Flight was packed without a single empty seat. Boarding is done by Cabin Special needs and zones and quickly turned into a scrum. The seats while stylish looking are very close together. They are much more narrow than they look. I'm a big guy at 6'2"" 235lbs and just getting into my seat I found it an impossibly small space. With a small personal item under the seat there is zero space. Thankfully during flight I could take it out from under the seat and it was not so bad. The crew for this flight mostly male with a single female serving were on top of their game. The Red inflight system for entertainment and ordering was brilliant. First service is rather awkward traditional front to back then it's all on demand. The food I purchased was a great Pastrami Sandwich. Nothing seemed too much trouble for this crew. They politely advised in advance when they would shut down the ordering service so people could get last requests in. Flight was only a few minutes delayed in departure and landing. Virgins Terminal in LAX is almost exactly as it was when it belonged to TWA and Eastern. Baggage claim was noisy crowded and of limited space. Overall very happy with Virgin America and looking forward to my trip home.",8virgin-america,13/08/13,LAX-SFO: Simple flight made easier by a relaxed crew. Great entertainment system blankets and pillows and a nice flow of a small meal and after-meal snack plus plenty to drink. Flight crew was very attentive from the moment of boarding and remained friendly throughout. Never had a grumpy flight crew with Virgin which cannot be said for other domestic carriers. Really great if you're a fan of the SF Giants on this particular route as they show World Series highlights on the SF Giants channel.,10virgin-america,21/07/13,On a 4 hour flight from DC to Los Angeles there was no complimentary snacks just sodas and water. 2 restrooms served a full plane and there was always a line of 4-5 people. First class had a restroom but no one could use it. Flight attendants were less than compassionate. The monitors in the head rest were not working for 3 of the 4 hour trip. I will never use this airline again!,virgin-america,17/07/13,We flew back from LA to DFW on 7/9/13 and we absolutely loved VA. One of the best flights out of the 10 flights that we flew the prior week. They have music headphones and TV's behind every seat. I am someone that is scared of flying but I felt really at ease when flying Virgin. I would recommend it.,10virgin-america,08/07/13,Uncomfortable seats and tardy planes. The economy seats from San Francisco to Anchorage were the worst we have ever encountered in the USA. They only moved slightly in position without actually reclining. My companion found this intolerable and insisted we pay a lot extra to return in first class which was very comfortable. I survived the economy seats only because I had three seats across from the aisle to the window. The outbound fight was over two hours late and arrived in Anchorage at almost three a.m. The return flight was over an hour late. If I have alternatives I would not fly this airline again.,1virgin-america,03/07/13,LAX-NYC return. Check-in a mess and overcrowded at LAX but so is everything. Tried to use the kiosks for checking in but international Mastercard and Visa cards not accepted for baggage or upgrades. Seems odd at JFK separately hauling your bags to a luggage belt after checking in - that's not communicated very well and it's something I haven't seen elsewhere. Flights delayed but nothing too bad. Cabin crew on all a bit sullen/unfriendly seeming but okay when talking to you. In-air food and movie purchases thwarted by international credit card issues. Was told off a little for bringing it up until the food cart came to my row and they could see the issue - charge for remaining choices was waived which was appreciated. Otherwise nice cabin with comfy seats and decent IFE options with directTV and wifi available. Lounge greeter at the Virgin lounge at LAX was really lovely - food options could be a little more filling as the bar is open and a few people seemed to be a little drunk.,5virgin-america,30/06/13,I fly 2-3 times a year and usually have used other airlines. This time I decided to give Virgin America a try. The flight was from SEA-SFO-LAS and return the same way. All 4 flights were delayed. The first by 2 hours the second by 1.5 the third by 45 minutes and the final 2.5 hours. We were told different reasons each time and none of them matched up with each other. One said weather one said construction another said mechanical problems and even one said they had to find a pilot. Seats are terrible. Crew rude. And yes this happened on each part of our journey. For being my first experience with Virgin America I was more than unimpressed. I will not be flying with them again.,1virgin-america,24/06/13,Los Angeles to Las Vegas 15/06 outbound and inbound is 20/06. Poor service despite only having 10 passengers onboard no soft drinks offered only beer wine and water. Staff more interested in talking to colleagues and organising their social life. On checking in for return flight staff unsure what to do were only able to give boarding cards for 1st out of 3 flights. Forgot to give us the luggage tags on check in so this caused no end of trouble with other flights.,1virgin-america,21/06/13,DCA-SFO-DCA. One of the better cross-country flights that I've taken and added bonus of being non-stop. Boarding is a bit weird-front to back but airplane was new and clean. Young flight attendants were pleasant and a nice change from the surly FAs of the legacy carriers. Direct TV and audio free but movies headphones are extra. I'm a petite person(5 ft) and leg room and leather seat were roomy enough. Yes there is no free snacks but I brought food with me and ordered free drinks from the TV menu. All in all Virgin America is a great cross country airlines and I would fly with them again.,9virgin-america,04/06/13,SFO-EWR (round trip) 4/24-4/28. One of the better airlines I've flown for domestic. The seats were more comfortable than the other airlines I have been on (Delta American). Staff were pretty friendly although at times were not as available as I would have liked. The food I would order did come almost instantly which I was very impressed about. Overall nothing to really complain about the flight and airline itself. The only thing was the delay I had but it was made up for in the air and I actually arrived about 20 minutes earlier even with a 30 minute delay.,8virgin-america,27/05/13,"Virgin America does many things well. They are usually on-time boarding is very organized they provide great on-demand in-flight entertainment wifi power/usb ports and generally clean planes. Satellite TV is complimentary but movies are not free and actually quite expensive. However there are areas for improvement. Economy seating is very cramped. On the near 6 hour trip from JFK-SFO my knees were jammed against the seat in front of me. IFE screen was also uncomfortably close to my face with the seat in front of me reclined. If you want more legroom you have to pay extra for ""main cabin select."" Furthermore there are no complimentary snacks. The ""buy on board"" food is not a good value. There is no hot food available for purchase and the sandwiches and salads are small and snacks are overpriced. Flight attendants are sometimes friendly and other times aloof. When I order a beverage from the seatback screen they sometimes completely ignore the request if it is a ""complimentary"" beverage. Yet if I pay for a cocktail it mysteriously shows up much faster. Overall Virgin America is a reliable and stylish carrier with great IFE but for the high prices they are charging the in-flight service could be better.",5virgin-america,16/05/13,Flew LAX to PHL with Virgin America for first time. Was very pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the flight was. I was not expecting Virgin to be such a great airline to fly with. I came equipped with plenty to entertain myself for these flights and found that I was not checking the time and waiting impatiently for arrival since I was comfortable and there was plenty to hold my attention with TV and WiFi. I always look for most economical flights and am disappointed when Virgin America is not one of them. I will fly Virgin to FT Lauderdale from LA this June and very happy about this. They will be my first choice from now on.,10virgin-america,15/05/13,Portland Or to LAX to ORL and it was one of the best economy flights I've taken in the US. The attendants were more than accommodating seats very comfortable and the aircraft was clean and seemed to be larger than other airlines. The flight crew were very nice. I will fly Virgin every chance I get.,10virgin-america,07/05/13,LAX to Las Vegas. Flight to Las Vegas delayed 2 hours due to 'mechanical problems'. On the return the flight was delayed 2 hours again. I was told again that it was mechanical problems. I called customer service and was told that the delay was due to weather. Asked if I would be refunded my fare if I decided to drive home because I could not be home as late as my new departure would put me at. I was told no refund but they would agree to waive the $100 cancellation fee. When we landed in LAX and the pilot apologized for the delay and told us that all flights had been delayed that day.,virgin-america,06/05/13,I thought American and Delta were bad but Virgin America took the winning cup as of May 5th 2013. First flights were delayed for more than 2-hours with no clear explanation no compensation no remorse! I had to wait over an hour for my luggage? VA decided to mix all the luggage for passengers from SFO LAS and Boston! In order to find your luggage one had to go from one carousel to another. No announcements were made as the employees themselves did not know were the bags would be. My husband and I were on 2 different flights I did not leave the airport until 10pm Los Angeles time. For someone that should have arrived at 6pm! My husband's flight arrived at 1.45am for someone that should have arrived at 10:30pm.,1virgin-america,06/05/13,We had significant delays on both legs of our round trip. We paid more money for an earlier flight which ended up becoming the last flight out. We flew round trip from Las Vegas to Seattle with stop in San Francisco each time. They would not accommodate us with transfers to another flight. A few of the members of the terminal crew were boldly rude. This doesn't speak for all members as one nice crew member consoled us and apologized for her co-worker's behaviour. We had a very lousy travel experience.,2virgin-america,22/04/13,Flew IAD to LAX in economy. Good seat size wider than other airlines at 19.7 however seat pitch was 31 which is about average. It's slightly different than other airlines in that you have to use the touchscreen to order food or drinks and the FA would come in to your seat with your order. The plane A320 was modern. The IFE system included excellent channels and wide variety of music. Compared to other major carriers like United American and Delta Virgin is superior when it comes to in-flight services.,9virgin-america,18/04/13,LAX-SEA roundtrip. I travel to Seattle on business 3-4 times a year and ever since Virgin America began nonstop service on this route it's been my preferred airline. The service is professional seats are comfortable food and IFE are superior and when things do go wrong the staff are much more forthcoming than Alaska or United.,10virgin-america,16/04/13,From San Francisco to Las Vegas. Flight was very smooth. Served soft drinks. No delay at all. Cabin crew were helpful and hardworking. Nice journey for me. Flying time was only 1hr and 20 mins. Cabin design was very modern.,8virgin-america,01/04/13,First experience with VX and I was pleasantly surprised. I only flew between SFO and LAX but the staff and cabin ambience was decidedly different from others and when I needed to change my return the counter staff was delightful. The product is a notch above and the welcomes seemed far more genuine than I have experienced on other US carriers. A good choice.,10virgin-america,21/03/13,Very disappointed with Virgin. Our second flight with them and it was not very good. Flight was from LAX to SEA seats did not adjust credit card sliders did not work on TV so we could not purchase food or movie flight attendants were not responsive. Asked for a headset and was told they'd bring one several times and never did. Never said why just didn't come back.,3virgin-america,25/02/13,The plane was clean and in good condition but on both legs the flight attendants seemed annoyed when you asked them for something. They seemed like they wanted to do the least they could for you and were surprisingly unfriendly. The flight was on time and otherwise smooth.,5virgin-america,20/02/13,I have been flying the SAN-SFO route for over a year now. Compared to the other options I have VA is the best I have flown. Staff are great the terminal (in SFO) is better than most 5 star hotel lobbies in terms of available eateries cleanliness and overall ambience. I have had a couple late flights into SFO - but that can be chalked up to the ridiculous fog cover during the winter months.,10virgin-america,18/02/13,We flew from Ft Lauderdale to SFO. Our seats were at the very back and that was fine. We were delighted there was no one in the third seat until I discovered the arm rests between the seats didn't go all the way up. The steward took a look but was totally indifferent. The beverage cart was passed once in a 5 hr flight. The seats were uncomfortable. That was the most miserable flight I have ever taken. First and last on Virgin.,4virgin-america,15/02/13,SFO-IAD-SFO on 2/6/13 and 2/13/13. Great flights both ways. Early arrivals at both Dulles and SFO. Flight attendants were courteous positive and helpful. Seats were comfortable. Baggage came out on carousel at SFO quicker than I expected or had experienced in the past.,10virgin-america,11/01/13,SAN-SFO. Admittedly this is an incredibly brief (under 2 hour) flight but everything about Virgin America impressed. Flight was cheap but the experience was better than first class in other airlines. Numerous entertainment options (with excellent satellite reception) comfortable seats very attentive staff and in SFO a terminal almost exclusively for the airline. The most pleasant flying experience in as long as I can recall.,10virgin-america,10/01/13,JFK-LAX. Flight delayed by almost 4 hours due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft (due to bad weather). Virgin compensated each passenger with a $50 credit for future travels with Virgin. I was quite impressed as the delay wasn't exactly their fault. I've flown with different domestic airlines and I found that Virgin has the friendliest and most helpful flight attendants. IFE is ahead of other airlines. I also love the cabin ambience and mood lightning. Highly recommended.,10virgin-america,10/01/13,We flew to Fort Lauderdale in December from Los Angeles round-trip. The new A320 aircraft's are very nice although a little small for a 5-6 hour journey. Return flight delayed extensively as staff were shuffling luggage from the aircraft belly to the overhead bins all in the name of aircraft balance and safe takeoff. The ritual lasted over an hour and not called for at all. The staff and attendants seemed cranky. Flights should not be overbooked and luggage balance issues should be solved outside the aircraft. Furthermore attendants and crew should be less cranky on a four star airline.,6virgin-america,07/01/13,Flew from SFO to Orlando with family including my disabled parents. Crew on flight from SFO to Orlando were excellent. However I was very disappointed with the entertainment options were very narrow and you had to buy everything false advertisement when they say you can watch Youtube. You can't they only have a very select videos and you have to buy every film you want to watch. On return from Orlando the crew were rude. Expected to pay for blankets however they didn't come to ask if we wanted to buy them or not.,2virgin-america,02/01/13,New York (JFK) to Vegas. Best airline I've flown on (domestic or international). Very comfortable seats. Onboard has a nice modern look to it. Great entertainment system. You can order your snacks on a screen in front of you. You can pull out your laptop pay for satellite Internet (which works) and be connected the whole flight. Overall a fantastic airline.,10virgin-america,23/12/12,Flew ORD-SFO-LAX going out LAX-SFO-ORD going back. Longest layover was 3 hours. Seats were very comfortable on an A330 very nice retro look to the plane. Excellent customer service good value for the money. Both on the ground and on the plane VA staff friendly and helpful. Would definitely fly again.,10virgin-america,14/12/12,San Francisco to Washington DC in main cabin select Row 5 and back on same route 5 days later. The Red touch screen is far advanced over other US airlines. The ability to open a tab for meals snacks and entertainment selections make Virgin in a century beyond their domestic competitors. The service was excellent and on time departures and arrivals made the trip even better.,10virgin-america,29/11/12,"The only way you could enjoy flying this airline is in the few first class seats. Regular seats are miserable and with three seats across terribly inconvenient for bathroom breaks. Only two bathroom locations - one in front for first class only and one in back for everyone else. When first class is ""fed"" the entire plane fills with the smell of their food and the only food everyone else can get is overpriced and unhealthy. The most miserable flight I've ever taken. I will not be a repeat customer.",3virgin-america,09/11/12,Main cabin select (front row economy) from LAX to Seattle. Full flight but handled well by crew. Like the touch screen ordering of snack type food and drinks. Plenty available. Economy select are emergency exit and front economy seats resulting on more leg room. Worth the money if you get a good deal. Seat comfort okay.,7virgin-america,09/11/12,SAN-SFO-SAN in Main Cabin Select. Flight out was on A319 and flight back was on A320. Both planes were new and clean. Check-in at both airports was fast and easy with priority lanes. Priority lanes for security at both airports provided. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew generally friendly. Ample legroom in MCS with free AVOD food and beverages. No hot meals available on short flights. Mood lighting upon boarding was interesting but definitely made it harder to see seat numbers especially on evening or night flights. Both flights generally on time. Can't comment on luggage delivery as I only had carry-on. Overall a great product and definitely the best domestic US airline out there. It's a shame they don't have their own lounges but they'll probably be my first choice for flights in the US and they offer great value for money too.,9virgin-america,07/11/12,SFO-IAD-SFO on November 2 and 4. Great service from the staff both on the ground and in the air. While there is food for purchase in the main cabin there is a good selection. The roast beef sandwich is really quite good.,10virgin-america,03/11/12,"PHL-SEA return via LAX. Pleasant flight attendants calming mood lighting and easy-listening music in the lavatories during flight. Although some of the hi-tech features on their seat-back entertainment system are not available yet there is certainly enough to keep one occupied and I can no longer accept doing a cross- country flight on any of the other ""greyhound of the skies"" US domestic services.",9virgin-america,07/10/12,I flew round trip on Virgin America from IAD to SFO. What truly pleasurable trip. Love the comfortable seats the entertainment system and the staff. After the abuse I have suffered on several other airlines recently Virgin America is going to be my first choice from now on.,9virgin-america,17/09/12,SFO-JFK. First class on A320. The check-in time was fast and efficient. The clubhouse lounge was nice and clean. Good selection of food and drinks. Flight attendants were OK for the flight. Seat was soft and comfortable. Entertainment system was a little complicated but had a good choice of movies. I slept for a bit but felt a little hard to sleep because it is a cradle seat. Food was good and their was a nice selection of drinks. I would recommend VA but I would suggest that they lower the price for First class a bit.,7virgin-america,04/09/12,LAX-SFO. The best airline for domestic flights. The IFE is expansive which includes the local channels and WiFi. Highly recommend.,10virgin-america,03/09/12,"Boston to Los Angeles with my two boys. One has a peanut allergy and although I don't expect accommodation just for him I was surprised that I was basically ignored yet other airlines always provide a ""buffer zone"" as well as a peanut-free environment. We were not informed our seats did not recline. Having a medical implant in my neck and a head rest that couldn't be adjusted I was in pain. There were 3 empty seats behind us. My boys moved to them because they were so uncomfortable. I was about to join them but they were told by one of the flight attendants that they couldn't sit there. Apparently they each cost $129 more and I would need to pay $387 to have seats that reclined. The seats were empty but still given my situation I wasn't allowed to sit there with my boys who were very upset. What I cannot accept is the fact that a man in my row sneaked to the same row across the aisle and sat there the whole flight for no additional fee. In my 60 years of flying I have never encountered such a rude flight team. I will say the plane was upscale and clean but who cares when it severely lacks in humanity.",1virgin-america,24/08/12,Very good airline and my favorite for domestic travel. I am a 2 million mile flier on United and I have now switched to Virgin America. I have flown seven round trips this year on Virgin. The food is very good compared to any other US domestic airline. The entertainment is fantastic. There is WiFi. The seats are reasonably comfortable. Although it does suffer from the same horrifically small legroom in economy class it is better than the majors.,10virgin-america,16/08/12,LAX-MCO-LAX. The planes are new crew friendly and the seats wide. This trip was the second time flying with them and have been impressed with the service.,9virgin-america,07/08/12,Four members of our family used Virgin America for our return flight from San Francisco to Chicago. Included in our party was our 81 year old mother who uses a walker. She always gets a window seat for the least possibility of the need to move. The flight became unbearable when 5 passengers from the back came to visit with the 3 passengers seating directly in the row in front of us. As they ordered several rounds of alcohol they begin cursing. What made matters worse is that when we complained to the steward they suggest that we move to the back of the plane and that there was nothing they could do. Due to our mother's condition we were unable to move but they continued to bring the rounds of alcohol to the party in front of us. We felt like we were in a bar our fight was from 7.45pm to midnight central time and our mother had to endure 3 hours of torture. We will never use this airline again.,2virgin-america,07/08/12,Trip from IAD to SFO was canceled resulting in missing all connecting flights with a partner airline. The partner airline (Air New Zealand) was a good deal more helpful in sorting out the mess than VA was - clearly staff are not trained for unforeseen circumstances for though they seemed to keep it together when things were running smoothly they fell apart as soon as things weren't. Faced with an angry stressed-out mob of people staff couldn't project the kind of authority and knowledge necessary to calm nerves. The agents on the phone were worse. It took me five tries to get the documentation I needed for my insurance claim which has yet to arrive. A canceled flight is bad enough; incompetent handling afterwards is worse.,1virgin-america,07/08/12,Short flight Las Vegas to San Francisco. Very comfortable seats in Economy. I enjoyed being able to watch ESPN coverage of the Open during the flight. Very short check-in queue at Las Vegas (other airlines nearby has long lines). A pleasant experience.,9virgin-america,31/07/12,Quick flight from Portland OR to San Francisco and back. Excellent staff they were genuinely nice but not overly scripted. Plane was very comfortable and entertainment is the best I've experienced.,9virgin-america,26/07/12,"Flight from IAD to SFO on July 26. Baggage check-in was efficient. Counter staff were friendly. Aircraft was clean. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I was particularly impressed by their attentiveness to the unaccompanied minor (about 11 years old) who was seated on my row. Food was good (had a roast beef wrap). Seats were comfortable for me (I am not particularly tall). My one gripe was with the ""red system"" satellite TV - it had spotty reception and then no reception. The rest of the system (music movie etc.) worked fine so must have be a Dish Network issue.",9virgin-america,26/07/12,Checked baggage three pieces for two people were sent to Chicago instead of to Manchester UK resulting in three days of vacation without clothes. We had no carry on baggage. In SFO we booked baggage through Las Vegas on to Virgin Atlantic. Plane was clean and on time going and coming. Ticketing agent in Las Vegas on the 19th was rude and wrong. She said one bag was 10 lbs over. That bag had been weighed by Virgin Atlantic and our personal scale and was not. Finally a man came to our aid and re-weighed it and found that it was not overweight so we did not have to pay for it.,7virgin-america,19/07/12,First time on Virgin. Cabin was attractive seats comfortable and real time TV. In addition the poorest selection of flight attendants - no one smiled. They looked like they didn't want to be there. On a 4 hour flight beverages offered once which must be mandatory or else nothing would have been served. The worst of the two flights was from SFO to ORD. The movie offering was unique until I see a movie that was for mature audiences being viewed in my aisle. I could never risk that when flying with my whole family. I will not be a repeat flier with Virgin America.,4virgin-america,17/07/12,SFO-PHL direct flight. Checking-in is a breeze using their kiosks and staff were proactive in helping everyone check-in (but watch out for those baggage fees). Seats were ok being they were a little cramped but they are made of comfortable leather. IFE gives you free music satellite TV (20 channels) as well as movies and TV episodes to purchase (but they were very limited). There are also various games for the kids and you could even chat with other passengers through your TV. My biggest complaint was that my IFE unit kept freezing and crashing during the flight plus the buttons are hard to press as well as very small. There is WiFi however it can cost as much as $20. Staff were friendly and helpful and offered to charge my iPad when our power socket did not work. I didn't purchase any food or alcohol but non-alcohol drinks are free. In short: Pros: Leather seats satellite TV music helpful staff relaxing cabin lighting fast check in. Cons: IFE crashes power sockets don't work lots of fees for wifi food alcohol and baggage.,8virgin-america,15/07/12,MCO-SFO 7/11/12. Not sure what I was expecting from this flight I guess being English I expect a 5+ hr flight to be treated as long haul and the service to match. Surprised when I saw they were using an A320 on this route by the end of this flight I struggled to straighten out. If you're over 6 feet tall I'd recommend paying for additional leg-room. Other than the leg room the seats were comfortable and the interior of the plane was very trendy. Mood lighting and condensation keeping the cabin relaxed with music whilst boarding gave a relaxing ambience. Entertainment system was impressive with a large range of on demand TV and movies (albeit at a charge). Being able to use the entertainment system throughout taxi take off and landing is a nice sensible approach. WiFi is pretty good and fast seems a little overpriced but it is a very fast service compared to other airlines carrying this feature. Main disappointment was that nowhere on my reservation did it mention there was no meal or snack provided during the flight so having boarded hungry I only managed to last 3 hours before purchasing a meal. Meals come as a large snack box which is very competitively priced at 7 dollars. Free soft drinks is a nice touch but alcohol is overpriced and being able to order drinks on demand from your seat is also handy when you're settled. Generally cabin crew were friendly and the pilot giving his announcement stood in the cabin adds to the edgy nature of end airline. Dressed down uniforms and a relaxed approach is a little different to other airlines but I think Virgin have found a good balance. All in all I would use them again but I wish they'd make a few of the inflight charges more obvious prior to ticket purchase. And 5 hours is a bit too long to be in such a small seat!,6virgin-america,05/07/12,JFK to LAX in Main Cabin Select (Premium Economy). Flight time 6 hours. Priority check-in and boarding which is standard for PE however the added bonus of priority security was great. The cabin has purple mood lighting and leather seats - a nice change from the standard aircraft interiors of other US domestic carriers. Drinks and food can be ordered on your individual entertainment screens. Being Main Cabin Select all food and drink is free. I had a turkey sandwich which was very nice followed by pringles. Drink selection was very good - wide range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Impressed to see Glenlivet scotch whiskey on the menu. Cabin staff were friendly and attentive. Entertainment options were solid. Overall a very positive flying experience - V America are a step above US and Australian domestic airlines.,9virgin-america,02/07/12,SFO to Fort Lauderdale main cabin. Bags dropped off quickly friendly agent. Boarding efficient people try to cram too many bags on to avoid paying $25 a bag for hold. Very friendly throughout cabin immaculate and brand new feel. TV good quality my regular headphones worked fine. Bought a rum for 6 bucks but water free and available throughout. Very impressed with the whole thing highly recommend! Lots of leg room even when seat reclined in front I'm 5ft 10. Cabin a bit cold but I like that. Bring a wrap or shawl.,10virgin-america,24/06/12,DFW - SFO and SFO - LAX. Brilliant airline civilised staff at check-in and in the air great value in economy seating and superb in-flight entertainment including the ability to order drinks and snacks using the touchscreen in front of the seat. Wifi service throughout the flight so I could work. Why is this so hard for other airlines to implement? The only thing that didn't work was the USB power socket under my seat and the only thing I didn't like was having to pay for the in-flight movie.,8virgin-america,24/06/12,"LAX - Boston (R/T). Both legs exceeded my expectations. Everything customer oriented with comfort and ease in mind. Nice well maintained aircraft professional courteous attendants in flight and on the ground there when you need them. On board entertainment consistent with the modern world and food on demand and of a good quality. If I am offered more nasty one size fits all ""snack box""!!! Thanks again Virgin. I'll fly no one else.",10virgin-america,19/06/12,PHL-LAX and LAX-PHL - 6/15/2012 and 6/18/2012 - Check in was fast and the plane itself is great. Love the back seat TV and headphones. Headphones you can buy for $2.00 and they come in blue silver and pink. My girls loved them. The main complaint I have about this airline is that on both trips the flight attendants were rude and unfriendly. Very bad customer service! They should have better schooling for their attendants. This is the first and probable the last time I would travel with them if they don't correct this. Southwest is usually what I fly and their flight attendants are awesome.,4virgin-america,07/05/12,LAX-SFO and SFO-ORD in early April 2012. Positives: check-in service at both airports was very professional. The planes were very clean the seats comfortable and there was more legroom than expected. On the other hand departure from LAX was delayed and there was very little information about the revised departure time and even which gate to wait at. Once onboard we waited for over one hour with very little explanation for the delay. Similarly on arrival at ORD the plane parked for over 45 minutes with very little explanation about when we could expect to disembark. I found that lack of communication to be quite frustrating and quite a contrast to the efficient experience in the air. I would use them again provided the price was right.,6virgin-america,01/05/12,SFO-LAX. Very nice terminal at SFO and efficient boarding process. Onboard we sat at the gate for about 40 min. No word from the pilots/crew on the delay. Crew seemed aloof and didn't really care aside from the drink service. The flight was over an hour late arriving at LAX but the staff didn't seem to notice. I don't know if it is VA thing to keep passengers in the dark about delays flight time arrival time etc but it seems like a policy that assumes their passengers are idiots and won't realize things are behind if they don't mention they are.,5virgin-america,01/05/12,One-way PHL-SFO. Since the airline was still new to Philadelphia the check-in line was completely empty. Onboard they offered noise cancelling headphones. The aircraft itself was new. The seats still pretty comfortable leather seats were a little stiff and wouldn't recline. The inflight entertainment seriously lagged when trying to play any of the games however the music and movie selection made up for it. Finally the staff were not only enthusiastic but they actually took the time to remember and refer to everyone by name.,9virgin-america,30/04/12,"JFK to LAX. Airplane was clean and looked good but my husband's seat kept falling into the gentleman behind him and then he had to manually bring it upright. Entertainment system was complicated. The crew were polite however the food was horrible and served cafeteria style. There was apparently a leak through the departure door. My feet were frozen solid. When the attendant was asked she said ""hold them up"" and laughed.",1virgin-america,17/04/12,"Two excellent flights from SEA-SFO then SFO-IAD a week later. SFO-IAD: easy check-in at home an efficient and airy terminal in SFO generally happy and helpful employees and a variety of entertainment options. I print boarding passes at home and don't check in luggage so I can't comment on the airport check-in process. My only gripe is the practice of blocking aisle and window seats from advance seat selection essentially forcing the customer to pay extra for ""premium"" or exit row seats. On both flights I managed to change to window seats so I know the airlines are deliberately blocking them in the hopes of generating extra revenue. Employees are aloof.",9virgin-america,16/04/12,Round trip from LAX to JFK. In both cities the check-in and boarding procedure was confusing and chaotic with extremely long wait times. There appears not to be enough ticket agents. They are really cutting corners with customer service. While I was waiting in the ticketing line for 45 minutes an agent kept warning us that the plane gates would close 10 minutes before departure. Yet there was no concern for getting the line to move faster. It was very disorganized boarding the plane and we could not hear the agent's instructions. Employees are aloof.,4virgin-america,11/04/12,"San Francisco to San Diego in so-called ""First"" class. Compared to other North American carriers much newer airplane and better seat. However nothing special if you apply international standards. Only 3 guests in First but dedicated stewardess preferred to read a magazine rather than pay attention to customers we had to press the call button whenever we wanted anything. Flight was around 90 mins but 30 mins before landing they stopped serving alcohol. Snack platter was lovely for this short flight but drinks pretty cheap and nasty.",6virgin-america,09/04/12,Flew 'main cabin select' from LAX to SFO. Flight was delayed. Seats were reassigned due to equipment change even though it was the exact same configuration. Main Cabin Select includes dedicated overhead compartment. We boarded ahead of the rest of the main cabin and put our blazers in the overhead compartment. Flight attendant told us it was a full flight and our coats had to go on the floor in front of us. (What happened to â€œdedicated overhead compartment?â€ù) Flight attendants were aloof and came across as uncaring even on a 55-minute flight (that was delayed over 3 hours).,5virgin-america,04/04/12,PSP-SFO-LAX overnight in San Francisco. On each flight ground and cabin staff were friendly professional and considerate. Seats were comfortable and I found many no-cost entertainment options. Non-alcoholic drink service was good in that they leave the drink can or give a generous filling as opposed to my previous experiences on similar carriers. Aircraft was well maintained and the ambience soothing with the cabin lighting.,9virgin-america,03/04/12,The best US domestic airline service available. Family flew Chicago to Las Vegas via San Francisco return. Staff pleasant and helpful at both ends. Interior of plane was new and clean. Entertainment system in seatbacks is superb - some movies and visuals are pay per view but the entire music selection is free. It's good to order food and drinks from your seatback and have them delivered to your seat. Staff wear interesting uniforms and pilots greet on arrival and departure. They offered the cheapest fares for the route and San Francisco is a fabulous airport in which to spend a couple of hours.,9virgin-america,15/03/12,Roundtrip BOS to SFO. Plenty of leg room. Inflight entertainment was very good. Really enjoyed the Sat TV and the on demand shows and movies. Flight crew were polite and helpful. Free soft drinks but no free food not even nuts or pretzels. Got in about 30 minutes early going out and on time coming back. Their prices were lower or comparable with other airlines.,9virgin-america,12/03/12,DFW to LAX. Great flight. Crew friendly and enthusiastic. First class seat very comfortable. Lots of personal space for a domestic cabin. Food of high standard. Overall a superior product when compared to most of the US carriers I have previously flown.,9virgin-america,06/03/12,Outbound SFO to Ft. Lauderdale was fine. Most staff seemed like they'd rather be anywhere but at work. Seats were comfortable. Leg room fine. Entertainment system good though not yet fully functioning. 1 beverage service in 5.5 hours. Return crew mostly had same dullness. Handset for entertainment system was unusable. No sympathy or offer for complimentary headset to use other features. Poor sound quality for emergency instructions. Air conditioning did not function properly. I will avoid this airline whenever possible until staff are better trained in customer service.,3virgin-america,29/02/12,BOS-SFO direct. Could be worse could be better. Pretty good leg room seats uncomfortable. You have to pay for: all food most drinks all movies TV on demand headphones checked luggage. Free: sodas coffee and tea water satellite TV games music carry-on luggage.,7virgin-america,28/02/12,DFW to SFO. I loved the fact you could watch TV and use the Wifi without having to pay extra. I also found that the personnel at the check in counter along with flight attendants were more pleasant than any I have encountered. The only issue that I found with Virgin America is that it does not fly everywhere. I had a connecting flight from DFW to Austin with American and they were not able to handle my bags so I had to re check in and go through security again once I arrived to DFW.,7virgin-america,08/02/12,LAX to DFW. Delayed 2 hours due to weather disrupting schedules. The departure gate was chaotic as passengers were asked to check cabin bags as the flight was full and cabin space was at a premium. Boarding was uneventful and the first class cabin is roomy seats are large and comfortable. Great recline particularly for long domestic sectors. IFE easy to navigate and a good selection of programs. Meal was tasty and the crew friendly and efficient. My concern surrounded the check-in staff checking your mobile while checking in passengers is not professional. Priority tag was not attached to my luggage which I discovered after waiting for my luggage in Dallas. Virgin America offers a great inflight product but their ground crew and reservation system must be addressed if the virgin brand is to represent a consistent product across all their subsidiaries.,7virgin-america,18/01/12,ORD-SFO. Flew priority select to SFO return in economy. Plenty of leg space in priority select. Snacks meals and drinks can be ordered at no cost using video screen. Once flight attendants made initial run through they were quick bringing drinks and snacks. Seating in economy comparable to most airlines snacks charged at usual airline costs and the selection less than in priority. Planes were new which is much appreciated after flying the old tubs American and Delta fly.,9virgin-america,11/01/12,SEA-SFO-DULLES on Jan 5. First leg delayed nearly two hours with no explanation and I nearly missed my connecting flight. Upon boarding the flight attendants were cheerful but the seats and carpet weren't properly cleaned - I saw crumbs on several seats. The second leg was a red-eye flight and the flight attendants were less cheerful more distant and arrogant. I tried ordering drinks on two occasions using the touchscreen system but the drinks never materialized. While other airlines like Alaska and Delta are stepping up their game - especially in customer service - VA seems to be falling behind.,5virgin-america,09/01/12,"Flying JFK to LAX in ""aim select"" their business class cabin. Being in 3d had to walk to the back of plane for bathrooms as business class had none. Got a fever onboard and flight attendants could not offer anything not even a blanket. If I go budget from now on I will stick to Jet Blue. Terminal at JFK is a reminder to the same terminal as it was in the 60's the international arrivals building. Virgin counter is on the opposite end of vast terminal where security check-in is.",2virgin-america,05/01/12,Flew Dec 26th JFK-Las Vegas. Two adults and 3 teenage kids. Boarding was early and as there were lots of families with young kids onboard total mayhem ensued with people trying to swap seats. FA's just stood aside and did not try to help or organize anything. Leg room was ok but the seats were thin uncomfortable cramped and short in the legs and I'm 5' 10. The inflight entertainment was good with a decent sized screen but many options were not available free of charge. Soft drinks are provided complimentary though no food was provided FOC it has to be ordered from your screen. Flight attendants were young but generally quite distant and a bit arrogant.,3virgin-america,29/12/11,LAX to DFW in seat 10F return in seat 20D. Booked regular economy but when checking in online offered an upgrade to Main Cabin Select. Flight attendants smiling and walking up/down the aisle asking what they can do for you. For the return no upgrades available but the economy leg room was at least 1-2 inches more than AA Delta or United. Ambient lighting and sound leather seats and plastic seat backs with clean trays. Baggage pickup in LAX was fast. Personal video monitor for music TV movies etc. Food was a step above some other airlines.,10virgin-america,20/12/11,LAX to JFK via connecting flight in SFO. Seats were okay flight was noisy all but the few passengers in first class are forced to use two bathrooms in the back which made for long waiting times and lots of people going up and down aisles. A lot of effort into having a trendy ambience but not attentive to efficiency and actual customer service. Upon boarding the leg from LAX to SFO we were notified that the cabin was full and they would need to start gate checking carry-on bags. However instead of bringing the gate checked bags back to the gate on arrival they sent them to the baggage carousel at SFO. Normally this would just be a detour and inconvenience but in this case I only had 20 minutes until my connecting flight boarded. A security guard told me my bag should've been checked to my final destination - if I had not checked with the airline desk I would've flown to JFK only to find my bag had been left in SFO. Overall this experience demonstrated poor organization and procedure with gate checking bags and poor customer service when problems arose. And on another note other airlines are already doing mobile device boarding passes to expedite checking in - not sure why Virgin doesn't do this when it otherwise tries to have a trendy and modern image of its airline.,3virgin-america,19/12/11,LAS-SFO on Airbus A320. Boarding was far too early and disorganised for a plane this small. Having said that the flight did leave about 3 minutes early. Leg room was generous but the seats were a little thin cramped and short in the legs. The inflight entertainment system was good with a decent sized screen though many options were not available free of charge. Drinks are provides complimentary though no food was provided. The flight attendants were young but generally quite rude and arrogant. The cabin ambience was comfortable flight arrived early due to good weather. Overall easily the best airline in USA.,7virgin-america,19/12/11,"BOS-LAX. My wife and I travelled to Los Angeles. The flight crew were happy and sincere. They cared about the jobs and were happy to answer any questions. Each seat had their own 8"" monitor to watch TV movies listen to the radio Videos on Demand view a GPS of the plane and weather conditions and to order food (great selection). All payable with a credit card on your monitor. The plane was clean and comfortable. The trip west arrived 30 minutes early. The flight back to Boston was just as pleasant but quicker.",10virgin-america,17/11/11,LAS-SFO. Probably the best domestic business class flight we've had. From the ground service to the service in the air everything was good. Food was great as was the IFE.,10virgin-america,11/11/11,Boston to LAX. Coach was small and cramped. All bathrooms were in the rear of the plane with a line most of the time. The plane had mechanical issues and had to return to the gate for repair meanwhile people that were late were allowed to sit on jump seats because their seats had been given away. There were issues with the electric outlets for computers and the food ran out in the first hour. No place to stand and stretch and many screaming unhappy children onboard. The return flight was a little better but not much.,5virgin-america,22/10/11,"LAS-SFO-half empty plane on a Tuesday. Loved the leather seats 32"" seat pitch was okay because seats are thin and comfy. Lighting was cool. FAs friendly and not seeming bored serving in the back of the plane.",6virgin-america,11/10/11,I was travelling with family and we were late. The ticket counter reps at Virgin America did a great job. They helped get my family (wife and 2 small ones) on board and set me up with a later flight with our luggage (we were too late to check the bags). They were very friendly professional and helpful. Plane has comfortable seats leg room (even in coach) and the individual screens make flying a joy. The fares we had were very good as well.,10virgin-america,05/10/11,JFK-SFO. Most disorganized boarding I have seen in years. So many people in toilets that we missed our pushback and delayed 1.5 hrs. FA did nothing about it until last 30 seconds with an impassioned plea to get into seats which failed. The PPV system and food ordering system failed as is often the case other passengers told me. The new Internet with Virgin owned laptop failed. FA's tried but there was no leadership. The service manager was the most disorganized of all and when I asked why she replied she didn't know the back as she usually worked in the 8 First Class seats.,2virgin-america,25/08/11,Food ordering system from the screen was down. Heard the flight attendant saying she disabled the system for a break. You have to pay for your first checked bag. Red Entertainment system great with plenty of movies on demand. I don't really care for the mood lighting wifi on every flight but it didn't work either.,6virgin-america,23/08/11,JFK-LAX in Economy. Uneventful flight - very punctual but you have to pay for everything. A good budget airline with innovative ordering from your screen. Crew cheerful baggage available reasonably promptly. I would use them again but may prefer the First Class cabin to experience the whole thing.,8virgin-america,17/08/11,LAX to DFW. The plane a new A320 was pretty full. The crew were very good. Great entertainment system with wifi and satellite TV. You could order snacks and drinks from your seat via the IFE system. Nothing was too much bother for the staff. A nice touch was the Pilots coming out of the cockpit at the end of the flight to thank everyone for flying with them.,10virgin-america,17/08/11,Virgin is a very good domestic choice. Staff are friendly smart and helpful. People seem to take pride in their work and have helped with every concern I have had. Their Economy product is very good quality yes you pay out of pocket for everything but it's worth it.,10virgin-america,26/07/11,SEA-LAX Economy. Nice new plane (A320) pink and blue lighting made for a very pleasant ambience. Flight attendants were very friendly. Great value product.,10virgin-america,24/07/11,Flight from Orlando to San Francisco. First time flying with Virgin America. The aircraft was an A320. Well maintained extremely clean not a single piece of trash or anything on the ground. I love the IFE you can just select a movie and watch it. You also have music games and live TV available. Food was great and the flight attendants were fantastic. I especially like the RED system where you can select something that you want to eat or drink and a couple of minutes later one of the flight attendants brings it to you. It's great value for money and I definitely recommend it to anybody who considers flying with them. I am 100% positive I will be flying them again.,10virgin-america,03/07/11,MCO-SFO-MCO. Great flight and great service. Love the wi-fi and that you can order food/drink from your seat. Virgin America bring back the enjoyment of flying. Look out legacy carriers.,10virgin-america,03/07/11,Fantastic experience on both legs A319 Las Vegas-NYC and NYC-LAX on A320. Clean newish planes mood lighting comfortable leather sets and decent legroom on a domestic route. Was very impressed with the captains speech in full view of passengers solid service and the ability to order snacks throughout the seat through the RED system. The IFE was more than generous with numerous free programs and fairly recent movies to purchase. Friendly ground crew at all locations and the male FA's were far more restrained than the Australian FAs we get with Virgin Australia. Americans finally get a domestic service that Australians have had for years.,9virgin-america,30/06/11,SFO-LAX-SFO. First time flying Virgin America and it was a great experience. The website was simple and easy to use. The FA's were extremely courteous and polite and the pilots were funny. The A320 had great legroom the cabin was well maintained and the IFE was had lots of music movies games and live TV. On the way back I asked to be put on standby for an earlier flight and the gate agent did it for me in a polite and respectful manner none of the nonsense you get from United or American. And considering the price they offer I definitely will fly Virgin America in the future.,10virgin-america,27/06/11,What a great experience! I flew from SFO-Orlando Florida. My seat ended up being between two rather large women and the one on the aisle was unable to stand up to let me get to my seat. The steward decided with me that rather than embarrass the aisle passenger we would wait until the plane was loaded and change my seat. I was moved to the front bulkhead seat given a free sandwich for the inconvenience I experienced (which to me was not an inconvenience at all). Well done Virgin America! You took me back to a time when an airline passenger was important and treated very well!,10virgin-america,25/06/11,JFK-LAX Main Cabin Select one way. Allowed two checked bags as it was booked on the same ticket as my international flight on V Australia. Loved what Virgin America offer especially the ability to order food and drink (free on this fare) from the IFE and then it magically comes to you soon after. IFE was also packed with plenty of music and movies etc. Very good experience they offer and present an excellent product.,9virgin-america,10/06/11,SEA-SFO A319/320. Check in and boarding efficient. Flight attendants courteous and professional. I found economy seats comfortable for a 90 minute flight - good leg room. Cabin clean and well maintained. Virgin is a unique product in the US vs the main line carriers.,9virgin-america,31/05/11,LAX-FLL-LAX round trip. Service was top notch with boarding efficiency inflight service food and IFE well above US standards. Virgin America is the only US airline whose premium economy and first class products are enough of an upgrade over economy to be actually worth the extra money on all flights.,10virgin-america,31/05/11,Virgin America just started flying out of ORD so I expected glitches. Not too many tho. Two major things to work on. The system for pre-printing boarding passes kept locking up. Going to SFO was fine returning it was impossible to print out. System kept locking up. Cost me money each time I tried but was never able to do it. Had to have an agent do it at the ticket counter. Seats were roomy enough planes clean.,9virgin-america,19/05/11,SFO to FLL travelling with infants. Plane new and clean. Flight attendants professional pleasantly surprised at good amount of leg room. Loved the individual screen for shows and ability to order a beverage from my seat. I'm most grateful for the flight attendant that opened the bathroom door for me and pulled down the infant changing table - as my arms were full of a baby and a diaper bag.,10virgin-america,18/05/11,LAX-JFK return. Virgin America straddles a weird and fairly confusing space between full- service and budget but is surely the most innovative airline in the US. So many simple touches - playing music at check-in captain farewelling passengers and explaining delays at the boarding gate instead of check-in staff ordering food from seat-back screen. The legroom is fine by domestic standards but would be tight internationally. My flight over was without incident but the flight back was cancelled. This is where Virgin America completely fell apart. They could not handle the mess of 180 angry passengers trying to get out of New York. Despite sprinting back to the check-in desk it took them 3 hours to get me a hotel and food voucher and they couldn't tell me when I could fly next but said they would call. They never did and it was up to me to contact them to try and get to LAX. There was no communication - we were not told the ticketing system was down - to us it appeared that they were just incredibly slow taking an hour to process each passenger. The airport hotel was excellent and they were able to get me to LAX via SFO less than 24 hours later.,7virgin-america,25/04/11,Flew from Las Vegas and loved the fact I could upgrade for less than $500. The plane was a bit worn but very comfortable. The attendants were very nice. The only complaint I have is the food was by far the worst I've been served on any airline. I pretty much starved as I could not eat what was served. Even the bread rolls were stale and not good. So please whoever is in charge of food service do something about it.,7virgin-america,03/04/11,My partner and I were blown away by the friendliness professionalism and dedication of the cabin crew on this flight. Not only did they present us with a bottle of red wine (signed by the entire crew) to congratulate us on our recent wedding but the head attendant came to the baggage claim to return my jacket which I stupidly left on board.,10virgin-america,14/03/11,JFK to SFO round trip staff professional and friendly. The flight on the way to SFO was only about 70% full which was nice and the flight attendants seemed to take extra time to make sure passengers were happy and were enjoying the flight. I enjoyed the satellite TV and the reasonably priced wifi. On the return flight (a red eye) the check in staff were especially friendly and helpful enjoyed the snack served and managed to get some sleep. The mood lighting is actually helpful. I would even pay a bit more to fly them over other carriers out of JFK.,10virgin-america,17/02/11,JFK to SFO. Booked main cabin select for extra leg room (+ one free case priority boarding priority check in and some free food / drink) - 6 hours before (in the middle of the night) we upgraded to first for $160 each. The money was well worth it due to the luxury of 2x2 seating for the first two rows only. However like a lot of flights you're at the mercy of your neighbours - in our case a mother and child who were loud. 1 hour delay announced at the gate at JFK where staff were indifferent beyond belief. They didn't really know what was going on and in the end we left over two hours late. There were some nice touches- lighting in the cabin music in the rest rooms pilot doing his briefing from the cabin. The flight attendants were very pleasant quite informal and helpful. The food in first wasn't really up to scratch. A salad main dessert. (and free drinks on request) followed by nothing - I'd expect a second snack at least. Although the seat was roomy there were no obvious instructions for the seat and it was trial and error to work out the best config to rest in. WiFi was NOT free and cost $11.95 for a laptop - good value with pretty good speed for 39000 feet. The negative comment really was on safety. A mediocre briefing poor checks of the cabin and lead flight attendant despite making the PA for all electronic items to be switched off continued to use his iphone! Main Cabin select seemed worth the money at the time of booking (and the people in our original seats looked comfy). The upgrade to first was worth every cent for the space though I think labelling the service first (other than the seat) is probably pushing it a bit!,8virgin-america,15/02/11,SFO-DFW return - the best bargain out there. Booked economy and upgraded to main cabin select then upgraded to first class. The upgrade included free meals free baggage wi-fi as well as TV and movies. The most inexpensive upgrade of any airline I've flown. The service was excellent. Since we flew with a handicapped passenger Virgin America made sure wheelchair accomodations were waiting for us at the arrival gates.,10virgin-america,31/01/11,"They canceled my return flight from Canada and then acted as if they were doing me a monumental favor by not charging me to change my flight to one that was not canceled. The customer service representative was smarmy and seemed to take some pleasure in my inconvenience. Then they advertised that flight on their website as ""sold out"" to make themselves look good. The prices are great but only if your flight actually happens.",virgin-america,31/01/11,LAX-MCO. We originally had booked Main Cabin Select but once we boarded we noticed there were available seats in first class. We asked the flight attendant if we could upgrade and he immediately went to the ticket counter and arranged the upgrade. Within 5 minutes we moved to first class. Needless to say it was one of the best flights we have taken. flight attendant was very attentive to our needs and extremely friendly. They were having an internet promotion at that time so internet was free for everyone not just first class.,10virgin-america,29/01/11,LAX-IAD Red eye. Check-in is terrific security was awful. New plane leather seats. Good food innovative ordering system. Didn't really sleep much. Slightly more pleasant than the United flight though rather be on a 767. Redeyes are all pretty bad.,7virgin-america,14/01/11,LAX-JFK flight. Two of us travelled and paid just under $400 for two for the tickets. When we got to LAX: they charged $25 for each checked in bag. $2 for each in-flight entertainment headphones $8 for each in flight film $10 for the wireless internet $8 for a sandwich. The seats were comfortable and the cabin was great but the corporate policy of this airline is questionable to say the least. I for one shall not be flying Virgin America next time. They pretend to be a major carrier but act like a low cost airline.,3virgin-america,09/01/11,JFK-LAX return and required a wheelchair for the return flight. Personnel at both ends couldn't have been more accommodating - perfect help and service including a stop in LAX to buy food and water for the trip. Seats were comfy enough especially for the very good price legroom could have been better but then it always could and the chicken salad sandwich I ordered in flight was excellent. I would fly with Virgin America again - Virgin Atlantic is another story.,8virgin-america,30/11/10,New York Kennedy to San Francisco economy. Boarding the aircraft I was told that my IFE would not work and I would be compensated. To my surprise it worked perfectly. The cabin was clean meal snack and drink options were a pricey let-down. Because it was the holidays (few days after thanksgiving) there was free wireless as opposed to the usual 8 dollars/month. My seat was comfortable and roomy - cabin had awesome lighting.,10virgin-america,03/11/10,YYZ-LAX First Class. It was Halloween and cabin crew were dressed in costume and quite jovial. Appearance of cabin very clean and crisp. Seat very roomy and electronic controls were great. Cushion on the firm side but quite nice overall. Dinner fine though being in row 2 and having only one choice of meal left was a bit disappointing. Entertainment system great with movies and live satellite TV available. On time departure early arrival. Bags out relatively quickly. Good trip I would fly with them again.,8virgin-america,03/11/10,LAX-YYZ. One of the best experiences I have had with an airline in a long time. The staff was extremely friendly the flight attendants were young and happy to help. The baggage allowance is amazing. The flight left on time and arrived on time if not a little bit early. Large variety of food and drinks on flight. I would definitely recommend this airline and I will choose Virgin America as my first choice in airline to LAX.,10virgin-america,27/10/10,SFO to JFk and back. The staff friendly professional and efficient. The whole process from purchasing tickets to online boarding passes simple food ordering on board was excellent and easy. I was most impressed that the cabin staff was constantly walking through the cabin to relieve passengers of any refuse so the cabin remained clean and there was no juggling of used cups food containers etc. My only difficulty is that while slightly more roomy than some other airlines the leg room is still uncomfortable for anyone with long legs.,9virgin-america,30/09/10,LAX-JFK return. Would recommend Virgin America to anyone - they were great (the only thing I could complain about is the $25 baggage fee but the fares were cheap so it didn't matter too much). New planes with unique mood lighting made for a pleasant flight. Both flights left on time and one arrived considerably early. The service and the food I bought were both good.,10virgin-america,27/09/10,LAX-Seattle round trip the same day. I was seated in the bulkhead premium economy row. Legroom was ample the inflight entertainment worked reasonably well except when the satellite cut out for about 20 minutes on the outbound the food was tasty and the cabin staff were much more engaging and professional than the unionised drones on United or Alaska. The only gripe I have is that the cabin interior has too much white which causes problems with glare when the windows are open. They need to add more contrasting colour to reduce glare.,9virgin-america,17/09/10,IAD-LAX-IAD. Check-in efficient and personable. Cabin crew on both flights helpful and friendly. The RED entertainment system charged $8 to watch on-demand movies on one's little screen - very overpriced but at least this is made up for with extensive free TV music and games options (especially the music - top-notch). Meal options are similarly pricey and sometimes disappointingly small although I can't fault them on taste. Lavatories are slightly roomier than the norm and each seat comes with the great convenience of an AC power jack. For a ticket that was only $20 more than the usual cross-continental cattle cars I had a fab flight with Virgin and will consider them again.,9virgin-america,12/08/10,BOS-SFO-LAX and back. Upbeat staff new aircraft and good service. I think their success right now is the crews are young - it will be interesting to see how the airline does in the coming years as the company ages.,10virgin-america,12/08/10,I have recently flown VA three times FLL-SFO. Check-in is cheerful. The airplanes are new and comfortable non-stop flights and great in-flight entertainment tasty food for sale on board. The flighty attendant service is very spotty and sometimes FA's are quirky.,8virgin-america,10/08/10,"BOS-LAX flew Virgin for the second time. Great comfortable leather seats new A320 and tv screens and entertainment on each seat. One problem the cabin crew I flew on a night flight and asked the cabin attendant for a pillow and a blanket. She replied very rudely ""Sorry but pillows and blankets are for first class passengers only!"" Although I had this experience I will fly Virgin again and bring my own blanket next time.",7virgin-america,21/07/10,LAX-SFO-LAX with new A320. Everything on time clean and nice plane friendly staff. I hadn't seen such a good IFE especially in low cost airlines. Easy boarding self-checkin and flight. Price was really low - 100 USD bought 4 weeks before.,10virgin-america,19/07/10,SFO-SEA and return. Virgin America leaves the US legacy airlines in the dust. Clean new A319. Fast check in both trips but shame about the check-in baggage fee. Friendly professional crew. The Captain came into the cabin before the flight departed to make his announcements and was waiting again while passengers left the plane. Very good AVOD entertainment system with very wide range of music and good range of free satellite TV stations and with a standard headphone jack). Comfortable seats with reasonable seat pitch in economy (compared to Qantas or American Airlines). Nice mood lighting in the cabin. Free coffee and soft drinks.,10virgin-america,17/07/10,FLL-LAX and return last week. Everything went smoothly on both flights (return was a red-eye). Operation at FLL very smooth since only 2 LAX and 2 SFO trips operate from there. Even at LAX which appears to be a hub for them everything went smoothly. Cabin staff was attentive to passengers needs and very pleasant. At LAX my baggage actually beat me to the baggage carousel. Would fly them anywhere they go.,10virgin-america,20/06/10,LAX to Washington (IAD) return as our feeder service from Australia. The service was superb staff friendly and flights ran on schedule. The planes are new mood lighting very pleasant. The touch screen video system is fabulous no need to buy movies as the free music and TV provide plenty of entertainment. Great also to find an airline that still provides free tea coffee and soft drinks which you can simply order from your seat using the inflight entertaimment system.,10virgin-america,06/06/10,LAS-SFO return. Fabulous experience even though we were delayed in both directions. Ground staff kept us fully informed when delayed and one enterprising ground agent at SFO started a trivia quiz at the gate to keep us entertained while we were waiting for the aircraft to arrive. I like the violet mood lighting inside the aircraft and both cabin and cockpit crew were brilliant. The free IFE is fantastic on a short flight and if you want to pay for a film you have the choice. Alcoholic drinks and snacks are ordered via your seatback screen but soft drinks are free. Great product great staff and great service.,10virgin-america,19/04/10,LAX-SFO and SFO-JFK. Upgraded Main Cabin to First Class (a pity that you can only do that 6 hours before departure now). The food really isn't up to much but the comfort on a long flight makes it worth the upgrade cost. Both flights left on time and arrived early. Crew were attentive and professional. Boarding was speedy and efficient. This might be a low cost airline but they offer better service than some of the 'full service' companies. For best fares book early.,9virgin-america,31/03/10,I have been both Main Cabin and First Class and yet to try Main Cabin Select. Both products are great. The only problem is that they need to lower the baggage fees for Main Cabin fares.,9virgin-america,11/03/10,"LAX-SEA round trip our first flight with our 3 1/2 month old son. We booked 2 premium economy bulkhead seats (Virgin America markets its exit row and bulkhead economy seats as premium economy). The premium economy fare was comparable to standard economy fares on competing United and Alaska. Unlike some US airlines Virgin America does not require babies under 2 to have their own seat. There is a level of courtesy and engagement with the customer among the cabin and ground staff that is not seen among the US legacy airlines. Cabin crew made sure we were comfortable. Flights on time and the bulkhead left just enough space to change a nappy (diaper in USA) on the floor in front of the seats. Virgin America's ""Red"" inflight entertainment/food ordering system works much better now than it did the first year or so the airline was in existence.",10virgin-america,04/03/10,"LAX-IAD-LAX roundtrip first class. Virgin America's domestic first class on its A319/320s is the best among US airlines with the exception of American's LAX/SFO-JFK premium service. The fare was comparable to the competition but superior service makes it better value for the money. The seats don't recline completely flat but go back about 150 degrees. The 58"" pitch is generous and in-seat massage function a nice touch. IFE is the best among US airlines with satelite TV programming a selection of 10-15 movies and a nice selection of audio tracks and the ability to customise your playlist and save it for future Virgin America flights. The mood lighting is very good for night flights. Food and beverage service is on demand and the food while in small portions is superior to most other airlines. The flight attendants and ground crew seem to want to please the customer more than those with other US airlines.",10virgin-america,11/02/10,I arranged for my 83 year old Mother to visit me in Los Angeles last week. She is suffering from severe memory loss and needs to be assisted I was taken back in the manner that all the Virgin America staff assisted her needs. From the time she left Fort Lauderdale Florida to her return the Virgin staff was amazing. They kept in touch with me via cell phone to alert me of her arrival here in Los Angels as well as her return to Florida. Beyond just handing her off to a porter to wheel her out the ground personal escorted her personally to her caretaker in Florida at the luggage carousel due to some confusion caused by my mother that caused the airline to be unsure of where the caretaker was. The respect care and humanity showed to my mother was incredible.,10virgin-america,08/02/10,SFO-LAX return. Easy quick and enjoyable. It is refreshing to see this standard of service in the US and on short haul flights.,10virgin-america,29/01/10,I was surprised how convenient and friendly the experience was for us. Although we encountered holiday crowds we were so thankful we werenâ€™t stuck on another airline. The service was exceptional the lines were manageable; and the plane was very comfortable! Virgin America is definitely turning us into loyal customers.,10virgin-america,24/01/10,LAX-JFK was very impressed from start to finish. Check in at LAX was quick and friendly. Boarding was quick. The red-purple lighting on board was a nice change from the usually bright white. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive and the legroom was excellent (we were at an emergency exit).,9virgin-america,23/01/10,FLL to SFO economy. Very good value for money. Great entertainment system no fuss check in pleasant and friendly flight and crew and an impressive system for ordering food and drink on board. By some margin the best domestic flight I've taken in the USA.,9virgin-america,19/01/10,LAX-SFO-LAX. Quick boarding friendly staff. I upgraded to Main Cabin Select both ways and was pleased. Great legroom in MCS and priority boarding with MCS. Although they say on their web site that MCS and First Class get priority security screening this is not true - no separate lines at SFO nor at LAX for priority security screening. Is the upgrade fee worth the price? You do get more legroom and priority boarding - otherwise economy is just as fine for I have flown both classes.,9virgin-america,13/12/09,SEA-LAX-SEA in November. Boarding a breeze. Captain came out and gave his spiel before departure. Flight attendant very friendly and prompt with meal (quite tasty) and drink service. Nice wide seats and IFE kept me occupied the rest of the flight. Return flight check in LAX much better than Seattle. Again no complaints with service in First. Another attentive FA and good meal. Tried the free wi-fi promo with my Netbook and it was pretty slick. Will definitely fly Virgin America again.,9virgin-america,04/12/09,SFO-LAX-JFK. I had high hopes for this carrier and I even flew them an extra leg as part of a connection to see what they were like. The problem with Virgin America is Cabin crew. There was nothing friendly about the flight. I smiled to one of the crew on boarding and he just looked away. There are only 3 members on each flight 2 in economy and the lead flight attendant spends most time in First class. The flight to LAX left 40mins late and just made the connection. Paying $20 for a 10kg bag is a joke and the way the ground crew were witnessed to be treating out luggage will further refrain me from using this carrier. Virgin America were also in no means cheap especially after baggage fees. I flew another Low cost carrier on the return and the difference was amazing. Will not be going near this airline again.,1virgin-america,04/12/09,FLL-LAX. Although the crew were not quite as vibrant as on previous flights they were friendly and efficient. A circumstance which exceeded my expectation was my choice of food ordered on board was unavailable although showed available on the RED ordering system. My order was refunded plus I was offered my choice of menu item at no cost. The refund was expected the offer of a free alternative choice was not expected but greatly appreciated.,9virgin-america,30/11/09,JFK-SFO one way. I flew jetBlue out to Boston drove up to Albany then down to JFK. As you can imagine I was tired. Takeoff was scary I could see the end of the runway while we were still rolling but otherwise pretty good. Plane not so clean found gum on my armrest. Cabin crew did nothing about it. Inflight entertainment good only it kept freezing. Seven bucks for internet access was steep so I decided to watch TV instead. It was OK only signal a little corrupt and couldn't see well. Also not a whole lot of channels. Don't be fooled by their low fares. Once you board you should be prepared to spend about fifty extra for a decent flight.,2virgin-america,23/11/09,"SEA-SFO-LAS. I had high hopes for this carrier. Segment to SFO was apparently staffed by an Award Winning Crew but they were not remarkable in any sense and perhaps tired as they weren't particularly cheerful. By the time flight landed in SFO LAS flight had already boarded but connecting gate was nearby. Return trip was extremely unpleasant on both segments. Very loud person in back row talked the entire way to SFO at times using crude and vulgar language. Crew did nothing to quiet the individual and also served him alcohol. At SFO landed at international gate and our connecting flight was far away at the very end of a domestic terminal concourse forcing us to once again go through security. SFO-SEA was noisy as well this time because of the non-stop chatter of the flight attendants in the back. Arrived in Seattle to be greeted by a sign stating that VA had been voted ""quietest passenger airline."" Though that refers to the noise from the jet itself my traveling companion and I got our first laugh of the evening. I will avoid this airline in the future.",2virgin-america,21/11/09,First class San Francisco to Las Vegas return. And just 100 USD extra! Very modern and fast check-in. Priority boarding take off on time snacks and drinks massage chair and very friendly and efficient staff. Personal feel and great value for money.,10virgin-america,26/10/09,JFK-SFO. Not one person at JFK knew how to handle a cancelled flight! Spent 6 hours trying to rebook! No one could do anything without approval of the supervisor who kept disappearing despite the fact that approximately 100 people were standing on line after 3 hours. In the end I was booked on a different flight than my boyfriend and had to cancel the trip after being told they couldn't do anything about the different flights!,virgin-america,23/10/09,SAN-SFO. Great check in and upgraded for small cost. Almost the same price to pay for my 2 bags in economy. Seat excellent staff excellent service excellent and entertainment excellent. Selection of snacks not excellent. Captain made an introduction speech from the cabin which I felt was also an excellent touch. Definitely a notch above Jet Blue and Southwest,9virgin-america,18/10/09,SEA-LAX and back. Flying with two toddlers was a pleasure on the way down to LA. Flight crew were friendly and helpful. Return flight was another matter. Woman at check-in not very friendly and seemed to be upset when I inquired about early boarding for children. Flight attendants on the plane not smiling the entire trip or helpful.,6virgin-america,18/10/09,JFK-LAS. The staff were okay not Southwest style of cheerful. I didn't know that I had to pay for food - so $3.50 later for a half can of Pringles I enjoyed the seatback entertainment. I would fly with Virgin again.,9
